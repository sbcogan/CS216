2,O Agni thou the best and earliest Angiras fulfillest as a Sage the holy law of Gods. 
3,To Matarisvan first thou Agni wast disclosed and to Vivasvan through thy noble inward power. Heaven and Earth Vasu! shook at the choosing of the Priest: the burthen thou didst bear didst worship mighty Gods. 
4,Agni thou madest heaven to thunder for mankind; thou yet more pious for pious Pururavas. 
5,Thou Agni art a Bull who makes our store increase to be invoked by him who lifts the ladle up.

1,1 WILL declare the manly deeds of Indra the first that he achieved the Thunder-wielder. 
2,He slew the Dragon lying on the mountain: his heavenly bolt of thunder Tvastar fashioned. 
3,Impetuous as a bull he chose the Soma and in three sacred beakers drank the juices. 
4,When Indra thou hadst slain the dragon's firstborn and overcome the charms of the enchanters 
5,Indra with his own great and deadly thunder smote into pieces Vrtra worst of Vrtras. 
6,He like a mad weak warrior challenged Indra the great impetuous many-slaying Hero. 
7,Footless and handless still he challenged Indra who smote him with his bolt between the shoulders. Emasculate yet claiming manly vigour thus Vrtra lay with scattered limbs dissevered. 
8,There as he lies like a bank-bursting river the waters taking courage flow above him. 
9,Then humbled was the strength of Vrtra's mother: Indra hath cast his deadly bolt against her. 
10,Rolled in the midst of never-ceasing currents flowing without a rest for ever onward. 
1,1 Guarded by Ahi stood the thralls of Dasas the waters stayed like kine held by the robber. 
12,A horse's tail wast thou when he O Indra smote on thy bolt; thou God without a second 
13,Nothing availed him lightning nothing thunder hailstorm or mist which had spread around him: 
14,Whom sawest thou to avenge the Dragon Indra that fear possessed thy heart when thou hadst slain hi 
15,Indra is King of all that moves and moves not of creatures tame and horned the Thunder-wielder. Over all living men he rules as Sovran containing all as spokes within the felly. 
1,Come fain for booty let us seek to Indra: yet more shall he increase his care that guides us. 
2,1 fly to him invisible Wealth-giver as flies the falcon to his cherished eyrie 
3,Mid all his host he bindeth on the quiver he driveth cattle from what foe he pleaseth: 
4,Thou slewest with thy bolt the wealthy Dasyu alone yet going with thy helpers Indra! 
5,Fighting with pious worshippers the riteless turned and fled Indra! with averted faces. 
6,They met in fight the army of the blameless then the Navagvas put forth all their power. 
7,Whether they weep or laugh thou hast o'erthrown them O Indra on the sky's extremest limit. 
8,Adorned with their array of gold and jewels they o'er the earth a covering veil extended. 
9,As thou enjoyest heaven and earth. O Indra on every side surrounded with thy greatness 
10,They who pervaded earth's extremest limit subdued not with their charms the Wealth-bestower: 
1,1 The waters flowed according to their nature; he raid the navigable streams waxed mighty. 
12,Indra broke through Ilibisa's strong castles and Suspa with his horn he cut to pieces: 
13,Fierce on his enemies fell Indra's weapon: with his shaip bull he rent their forts in pieces. 
14,Indra thou helpest Kutsa whom thou lovedst and guardedst brave Dagadyu when he battled 
15,Svitra's mild steer O Maghavan thou helpest in combat for the land mid Tugra's houses.

5,Now Brahmanaspati speaks forth aloud the solemn hymn of praise 
6,May we in holy synods Gods! recite that hymn peerless that brings felicity. 
7,Who shall approach the pious? who the man whose sacred grass is trimmed? 
8,He amplifies his lordly might with kings he slays: e'en mid alarms he dwells secure In great or lesser fight none checks him none subdues -the wielder of the thunderbolt.

5,See this abundant wealth that he possesses and put your trust in Indra's hero vigour. 
6,To him the truly strong whose deeds are many to him the strong Bull let us pour the Soma. The Hero watching like a thief in ambush goes parting the possessions of the godless.

2,These men have come to Indra for assistance: shall he not quickly come upon these pathways? 
3,He who hath only wish as his possession casts on himself casts foam amid the waters. 
4,This hath his kinship checked who lives beside us: with ancient streams forth speeds and rules the Hero Anjasi Kulisi and Virapatni delighting him bear milk upon their waters.

5,Ye Gods who yonder have your home in the three lucid realms of heaven 
6,What is your firm support of Law? What Varuna's observant eye? 
7,1 am the man who sang of old full many a laud when Soma flowed.

1.,ON that most wondrous car of yours O Indra and Agni which looks round on all things living Take ye your stand and come to us together and drink libations of the flowing Soma. 
2,As vast as all this world is in its compass deep as it is with its far-stretching surface 
3,For ye have won a blessed name together: yea with one aim ye strove O Vrtra-slayers. 
4,Both stand adorned when fires are duly kindled spreading the sacred grass with lifted ladles. Drawn by strong Soma juice poured forth around us come Indra-Agni and display your favour. 
5,The brave deeds ye have done Indra and Agni the forms ye have displayed and mighty exploits The ancient and auspicious bonds of friendship -for sake of these drink of the flowing Soma. 
6,As first I said when choosing you in battle we must contend with Asuras for this Soma. 
7,If in your dwelling or with prince or Brahman ye Indra-Agni Holy Ones rejoice you. 
8,If with the Yadus Turvasas ye sojourn with Druhyus Anus Purus Indra-Agni! 
9,Whether O Indra-Agni ye be dwelling in lowest earth in central or in highest. 
10,Whether O Indra-Agni ye be dwelling in highest earth in central or in lowest 
1,1 Whether ye be in heaven O Indra-Agni on earth on mountains in the herbs or waters 
12,If when the Sun to the mid-heaven hath mounted ye take delight in food O Indra-Agni 
13,Thus having drunk your fill of our libation win us all kinds of wealth Indra and Agni. 
1.,LONGING for weal I looked around in spirit for kinsmen Indra-Agni or for brothers. 
2,For I have heard that ye give wealth more freely than worthless son-in-law or spouse's brother. 
3,Let us not break the cords: with this petition we strive to gain the powers of our forefathers. 
4,For you the bowl divine Indra and Agni presses the Soma gladly to delight you. 
5,You I have heard were mightiest Indra-Agni when Vrtra fell and when the spoil was parted. 
6,Surpassing all men where they shout for battle ye Twain exceed the earth and heaven in greatness. Greater are ye than rivers and than mountains O Indra-Agni and all things beside them. 
7,Bring wealth and give it ye whose arms wield thunder: Indra and Agni with your powers protect us. Now of a truth these be the very sunbeams wherewith our fathers were of old united. 
8,Give ye who shatter forts whose hands wield thunder: Indra and Agni save us in our battles. 
1.,THE holy work I wrought before is wrought again: my sweetest hymn is sung to celebrate your praise. Here O ye Rbhus is this sea for all the Gods: sate you with Soma offered with the hallowing word. 
2,When seeking your enjoyment onward from afar ye certain of my kinsmen wandered on your way Sons of Sudhanvan after your long journeying ye came unto the home of liberal Savitar. 
3,Savitar therefore gave you immortality because ye came proclaiming him whom naught can hide; 
4,When they had served with zeal at sacrifice as priests they mortal as they were gained immortality. 
5,The Rbhus with a rod measured as 'twere a field the single sacrificial chalice wide of mouth. 
6,As oil in ladles we through knowledge will present unto the Heroes of the firmament our hymn- The Rbhus who came near with this great Father's speed and rose to heaven's high sphere to cat the strengthening food. 
7,Rbhu to us is Indra freshest in his might Rbhu with powers and wealth is giver of rich gifts. 
8,Out of a skin O Rbhus once ye formed a cow and brought the mother close unto her calf again. 
9,Help us with strength where spoil is won O Indra: joined with the gbhus give us varied bounty. 
1.,WORKING with skill they wrought the lightly rolling car: they wrought the Bays who bear Indra and bring great gifts. 
2,For sacrifice make for us active vital power for skill and wisdom food with noble progeny. 
3,Do ye O Rbhus make prosperity for us prosperity for car ye Heroes and for steed. 
4,Indra the Rbhus' Lord I invocate for aid the Rbhus Vajas Maruts to the Soma draught. 
5,May Rbhu send prosperity for battle may Vaja conquering in the fight protect us. 
1,To give first thought to them I worship Heaven and Earth and Agni fair bright glow to hasten their approach. 
2,Ample unfailing they have mounted as it were an eloquent car that ye may think of us and give. 
3,Ye by the might which heavenly nectar giveth you are in supreme dominion Lords of all these folk. Come hither unto us O Asvins with those aids wherewith ye Heroes made the barren cow give milk. 
4,The aids wherewith the Wanderer through his offipring's might or the Two-Mothered Son shows swift est

4,When for the sake of those oppressed and Kutsa as he battled 
5,When fighting singly Indra. thou o'ercamest all the furious Gods thou slewest those who strove with t hee. 
6,When also for a mortal man Indra thou speddest forth the Sun 
7,What? Vrtra-slayer art not thou Maghavan fiercest in thy wrath? 
8,And this heroic deed of might thou Indra also hast achieved 
9,Thou Indra Mighty One didst crush Usas though Daughter of the Sky.

13,Valiantly didst thou seize and take the store which Susna had amassed 
14,Thou Indra also smotest down Kulitara's son Sambara 
15,Of Dasa Varcin's thou didst slay the hundred thousand and the five

1,. THIS holy hymn sublime and sevenheaded sprung from eternal Law our sire discovered. Ayasya friend of all men hath engendered the fourth hymn as he sang his laud to Indra. 
2,Thinking aright praising eternal Order the sons of Dyaus the Asura those heroes 
3,Girt by his friends who cried with swanlike voices bursting the stony barriers of the prison Brhaspati spake in thunder to the cattle and uttered praise and song when he had found them. 
4,Apart from one away from two above him he drave the kine that stood in bonds of falsehood. Brhaspati seeking light amid the darkness drave forth the bright cows: three he made apparent. 
5,When he had cleft the lairs and western castle he cut off three from him who held the waters. Brhaspati discovered while he thundered like Dyaus the dawn the Sun the cow the lightning. 
6,As with a hand so with his roaring Indra cleft Vala through the guardian of the cattle. 
7,He with bright faithful Friends winners of booty hath rent the milker of the cows asunder. Brhaspati with wild boars strong and mighty sweating with heat hath gained a rich possession. 
8,They longing for the kine with faithful spirit incited with their hymns the Lord of cattle. 
9,In our assembly with auspicious praises exalting him who roareth like a lion 
10,When he had won him every sort of booty and gone to heaven and its most lofty mansions Men praised Brhaspati the Mighty bringing the light within their mouths from sundry places.

12,Indra with mighty strength cleft asunder the head of Arbuda the watery monster 
1,. LIKE birds who keep their watch plashing in water like the loud voices of the thundering rain-cloud. Like merry streamlets bursting from the mountain thus to Brhaspati our hymns have sounded. 
2,The Son of Angirases meeting the cattle as Bhaga brought in Aryaman among us. 
3,Brhaspati having won them from the mountains strewed down like barley out of winnowing- baskets 
4,As the Sun dews with meath the seat of Order and casts a flaming meteor down from heaven. 
5,Forth from mid air with light he dravc the darkness as the gale blows a lily from the fiver. 
6,Brhaspati when he with fiery lightnings cleft through the weapon of reviling Vala 
7,That secret name borne by the lowing cattle within the cave Brhaspati discovered 
8,He looked around on rock-imprisoned sweetness as one who eyes a fish in scanty water. 
9,He found the light of heaven and fire and Morning: with lucid rays he forced apart the darkness. 
10,As trees for foliage robbed by winter Vala mourned for the cows Brhaspati had taken. 
1,1 Like a dark steed adorned with pearl the Fathers have decorated heaven With constellation s. They set the light in day in night the darkness. Brhaspati cleft the rock and found the cattle. 
12,This homage have we.offered to the Cloud God who thunders out to many in succession. 
1.,Auspicious is the aspect of Vadhryasva's fire good is its guidance pleasant are its visitings. 
2,Butter is that which makes Vadhryaiva's fire growstrong: the butter is its food the butter makes it fat.

8,Thine is the teeming cow O Jatavedas who pours at once her ceaseless flow Sabardhuk 
9,Even Immortal Gods O Jatavedas Vadhryasva's Kinsman have declared thy grandeur. 
10,Like as a father bears his son O Agni Vadhryasva bare thee in his lap and served thee. 
1,1 Vadhryasva's Agni evermore hath vanquished his foes with heroes who had pressed the Soma. 
12,This Agni of Vadhryasva Vrtra-slayer lit from of old must be invoked with homage. 
1.,ENJOY O Agni this my Fuel welcome the oil-filled ladle where we pour libation. 
2,May he who goes before the Gods come hither with steeds whose shapes are varied Narasarhsa. May he most Godlike speed our offered viands with homage God-ward on the path of Order. 
3,Men with oblations laud most constant Agni and pray him to perform an envoy's duty. 
4,May the delight of Gods spread out transversely: may it be with us long in length and fragrant. 
5,Touch ye the far-extending height of heaven or spring apart to suit the wide earth's measure. Yearning ye Doors with those sublime in greatness seize eagerly the heavenly Car that cometh. 
6,Here in this shrine may Dawn and Night the Daughters of Heaven the skilful Goddesses be seated. In your wide lap auspicious willing Ladies may the Gods seat them with a willing spirit. 
7,Up stands the stone high burns the fire enkindled: Aditi's lap contains the Friendly Natures 
8,On our wide grass Three Goddesses be seated: for you have we prepared and made it pleasant.

1.,WHEN-men Brhaspati giving names to objects sent out Vak's first and earliest utterances 
2,Where like men cleansing corn-flour in a cribble the wise in spirit have created language 
3,With sacrifice the trace of Vak they followed and found her harbouring within the Rsis. 
4,One man hath ne'er seen Vak and yet he seeth: one man hath hearing but hath never heard her. 
5,One man they call a laggard dull in friendship: they never urge him on to deeds of valour. 
6,No part in Vak hath he who hath abandoned his own dear friend who knows the truth of friendship. Even if he hears her still in vain he listens: naught knows he of the path of righteous action. 
7,Unequal in the quickness of their spirit are friends endowed alike with eyes and hearing. 
8,When friendly Brahmans sacrifice together with mental impulse which the heart hath fashioned 
9,Those men who step not back and move not forward nor Brahmans nor preparers of libations 
10,All friends are joyful in the friend who cometh in triumph having conquered in assembly. 
1,1 One plies his constant task reciting verses one sings the holy psalm in Sakvari measures. 
1.,LET US with tuneful skill proclaim these generations of the Gods That one may see them when these hymns are chanted in a future age. 
2,These Brahmanaspati produced with blast and smelting like a Smith 
3,Existence in the earliest age of Gods from Non-existence sprang. 
4,Earth sprang from the Productive Power the regions from the earth were born. 
5,For Aditi O Daksa she who is thy Daughter was brought forth. 
6,When ye O Gods in yonder deep closeclasping one another stood 
1.,THOU wast born mighty for victorious valour exulting strongest full of pride and courage. 
2,There with fiend's ways e'en Prsni was seated: with much laudation they exalted Indra. 
3,High are thy feet when on thy way thou goest: the strength thou foundest here hath lent thee vigour. Thousand hyenas in thy mouth thou holdest. O Indra mayst thou turn the Asvins hither. 
4,Speeding at once to sacrifice thou comest for friendship thou art bringing both Nasatyas. 
5,Glad for the race that rests on holy Order with friends who hasten to their goal hath Indra With these his magic powers assailed the Dasyu: he cast away the gloomy mists the darkness. 
6,Two of like name for him didst thou demolish as Indra striking down the car of Usas. 
7,War-loving Namuci thou smotest robbing the Dasa of his magic for the Rsi. 
8,These names of thine thou hast fulfilled completely: as Lord thou boldest in thine arm O Indra. 
9,May the sweet Soma juices make him happy to cast his quoit that lies in depth of waters. 
10,When others call him offspring of the Courser my meaning is that Mighty Power produced him. He came from Manyu and remained in houses: whence he hath sprung is known to Indra only. 
1,1 Like birds of beauteous wing the Priyamedhas Rsis imploring have come nigh to Indra: 
1,. 1 AM prepared to laud with song or worship the Noble Ones who are in earth and heaven Or Coursers who have triumphed in the contest or those who famed have won the prize with glory. 2 Their call the c all of Gods went up to heaven: they kissed the ground with glory-seeking spirit There where the Gods lo ok on for happy fortune and like the kindly heavens bestow their bounties. 3 This is the song of those 1m mortal Beings who long for treasures in their full perfection. May these completing prayers and sacrifices  bestow upon us wealth where naught is wanting. 4 Those living men extolled thy deed O Indra those w ho would fain burst through the stall of cattle Fain to milk her who bare but once great lofty whose Son s are many and her streams past number. 5 Sacivan win to your assistance Indra who never bends who o vercomes his foemen. Rbhuksan Maghavan the hymn's upholder who rich in food bears man's kind frie nd the thunder. 6 Since he who won of old anew hath triumphed Indra hath earned his name of Vrtra-sla ycr. He hath appeared the mighty Lord of Conquest. What we would have him do let him accomplish. 
1,. THE singer O ye Waters in Vivasvan's place shall tell your grandeur forth that is beyond compare. The Rivers have come forward triply seven and seven. Sindhu in might surpasses all the streams that flo w. 
2,Varuna cut the channels for thy forward course O Sindhu when thou rannest on to win the race. 
3,His roar is lifted up to heaven above the earth: he puts forth endless vigour with a flash of light.

6,Stirred be the glorious Stones: let it press out the juice the Stone with heavenly song that reaches up to heaven 
7,The Stones press out the Soma swift as car-bome men and eager for the spoil drain forth the sap ther eof 
8,Ye present men have been most skilful in your work even ye O Stones who pressed Soma for Indra's drink. 
1.,As with their voice from cloud they sprinkle treasure so are the wise man's liberal sacrifices. 
1,praise their Company that merits worship as the good Martits' priest to pay them honour. 
2,The youths have wrought their ornaments for glory through many nights -this noble band of Maruts. Like stags the Sons of Dyatis have striven onward the Sons of Aditi grown strong like pillars. 
3,They who extend beyond the earth and heaven by their own mass as from the cloud spreads Surya; Like mighty Heroes covetous of glory like heavenly gallants who destroy the wicked. 
4,When ye come nigh as in the depth of waters the earth is loosened as it were and shaken. 
5,Ye are like horses fastened to the chariot poles luminous with your beams with splendour as at dawn; Like self-bright falcons punishers of wicked men like hovering birds urged forward scattering rain arou nd. 
6,When ye come forth O Maruts from the distance from the great treasury of rich possessions 
7,He who engaged in the rite's final duty brings as a man oblation to the Maruts 
8,For these are helps adored at sacrifices bringing good fortune by their name Adityas.

4,Like spokes of car-wheels in one nave united ever victorious like heavenly Heroes 
5,They who are fleet to travel like the noblest steeds long to obtain the prize like bounteous charioteers Like waters speeding on with their precipitous floods like omniform Angirases with Sama-hymns. 
6,Born from the stream like press-stones are the Princes for ever like the stones that crush in pieces; Sons of a beauteous Dame like playful children like a great host upon the march with splendour. 
7,Like rays of Dawn the visitors of sacrifice they shine with ornaments as eager to be bright. 
8,Gods send us happiness and make us wealthy letting us singers prosper O ye Maruts. 
1,. 1 HAVE beheld the might of this Great Being. Immortal in the midst of tribes of mortals. 
2,His eyes are turned away his head is hidden: unsated with his tongue he eats the fuel. 
3,Seeking as 'twere his Mother's secret bosom he like a child creeps on through wide-spread bushes. One he finds glowing like hot food made ready and kissing deep within the earth's recmes. 
4,This holy Law I tell you Earth and Heaven: the Infant at his birth dovours his Parents. 
5,This man who quickly gives him food who offers his gifts of oil and butter and supports him - Him with his thousand eyes he closely looks on: thou showest him thy face from all sides Agni.

7,He born in wood hath yoked his horses rushing in all directions held with reins that glitter. 
1.,AGNI bestows the fleet prize-winning courser: Agni the hero famed and firm in duty.

3,Agni rejoiced the car of him who praised lim and from the waters burnt away jarutha. 
4,Agni hath granted wealth that decks the hero and sent the sage who wins a thousand cattle. Agni hath made oblations rise to heaven: to every place are Agni's laws extended. 
5,With songs of praise the Rsis call on Agni; on Agni heroes worsted in the foray. 
6,Races of human birth pay Agni worship men who have sprung from Nahus' line adore him. Stablished in holy oil is Agni's pasture on the Gandharva path of Law and Order. 
7,The Rbhus fabricated prayer for Agni and we with mighty hymns have called on Agni. 
1,. HE who sate down as Hotar-priest the Rsi our Father offering up all things existing - He seeking through his wish a great possession came among men on earth as archetypal. 
2,What was the place whereon he took his station? What was it that supported him? How was it? 
3,He who hath eyes on all sides round about him a mouth on all sides arms and feet on all sides 
4,What was the tree what wood in sooth produced it from which they fashioned out the earth and heaven ? 
5,Nine highest lowest sacrificial natures and these thy mid-most here O Visvakarman 
6,Bring thou thyself exalted with oblation O Visvakarman Earth and Heaven to worship. 
7,Let us invoke to-day to aid our labour the Lord of Speech the thought-swift Visvakarman. 
1.,THE Father of the eye the Wise in spirit created both these worlds submerged in fatness. Then when the eastern ends were firmly fastened the heavens and the earth were far extende d. 2 Mighty in mind and power is Visvakarman Maker Disposer and most lofty Presence.

6,The waters they received that germ primeval wherein the Gods were gathefed all together.

2,Flashing like fire be thou O conquering Manyu invoked O Victor as our army's leader. 
3,O Manyu overcome thou our assailant on! breaking slaying crushing down the foemen.

2,By Soma are the Adityas strong by Soma mighty is the earth. 
3,One thinks when they have brayed the plant that he hath drunk the Soma's juice; 
4,Soma secured by sheltering rules guarded by hymns in Brhati 
5,When they begin to drink thee then O God thou swellest out again. 
6,Raibhi was her dear bridal friend and Narasamsi led her home. 
7,Thought was the pillow of her couch sight was the unguent for her eyes: 
8,Hymns were the cross-bars of the pole Kurira-metre decked the car: 
9,Soma was he who wooed the maid: the groomsmen were both Asvins when The Sun-God Savitar bestowed his willing Surya on her Lord. 
10,Her spirit was the bridal car; the covering thereof was heaven: 
1,1 Thy Steers were steady kept in place by holy verse and Sama-hymn: 
12,Clean as thou wentest were thy wheels wind was the axle fastened there. 
13,The bridal pomp of Surya which Savitar started moved along. 
14,When on your three-wheeled chariot O Asvins ye came as wooers unto Surya's bridal 
15,O ye Two Lords of lustre then when ye to Surya's wooing came 
16,The Brahmans by their seasons know O Surya those two wheels of thine: 
17,To Surya and the Deities to Mitra and to Varuna. 
18,By their own power these Twain in close succession move; 
19,He born afresh is new and new for ever ensign of days he goes before the Mornings Coming he orders f6r the Gods their portion. The Moon prolongs the days of our existence. 
20,Mount this all-shaped gold~hued with strong wheels fashioned of Kimsuka and Salmali light-roili 
21,Rise up from hence: this maiden hath a husband. 1 laud Visvavasu with hymns and homage.

24,Now from the noose of Varuna 1 free thee wherewith Most Blessed Sa vital' hath bound thee. 
25,Hence and not thence I send these free. 1 make thee softly fettered there. 
26,Let Pusan take thy hand and hence conduct thee; may the two Asvins on their car transport thee. Go to the house to be the household's mistress and speak as lady ito thy gathered people. 
27,Happy be thou and prosper witlh thy children here: be vigilant to rule thy household in this home. Closely unite thy body with this; man thy lord. So shall ye full of years address your company.

'Let the god Savitr anoint thee with honey' he says; verily he anoints it with glory. ’O plant guard it; O axe harm it not’ he says; the axe is the thunderbolt; (verily it serves) for atonement. The brilliance of the tree which fears the axe falls away with the first chip; the first chip which falls he should take up; verily he takes it up with its brilliance [2]. These worlds are afraid of the falling forward of the tree. 'With thy top graze not the sky with thy middle harm not the atmosphere’ he says; verily he makes it tender for these worlds. 'O tree grow with a hundred shoots' (with these words) he sacrifices on the stump; therefore many (shoots) spring up from the stump of trees. 'May we grow with a thousand shoots' he says; verily he invokes this blessing. He should cut it so that it will not touch the axle [3]. If he were to cut it so that it would touch the axle the cattle of the sacrificer would be liable to perish. If he desire of any one 'May he be without support' he should cut for him a branch; this among trees is not supported; verily he is without support. If he desire of any one 'May he be without cattle' he should cut for him (a post) without leaves and with a withered top; this among trees is without cattle; verily he becomes without cattle. If he desire of any one 'May he be rich in cattle' he should cut for him one with many leaves and many branches; this [4] among trees is rich in cattle; verily he becomes rich in cattle. He should cut one that is supported for one who desires support; this among trees is supported which grows from its own birthplace on level ground and is firm. He should cut one which leans towards the west for it is leaning over for the sacrifice. He should cut one of five cubits for him of whom he desires 'May the higher sacrifice condescend to him'; the Pankti has five syllables the sacrifice is

Those for two deities are the breaths [4] he sets down full vessels; therefore the breaths are full within; wherever in the performance of the sacrifice nothing is done in that place the Raksases attack the sacrifice; in that he sets down full vessels the part of the sacrifice being performed is deposited to prevent the entry of the Raksases.

42nd,volume of the the Sacred Books of the East is an anthology of representative texts from the Atharva-veda the fourth Veda. Since the order is not that of the original I have inserted a five digit number in wavy brackets in front of each hymn where the first two digits are the book and the remaining three digits are the hymn number. For instance {
07044},is the 44th verse of the 7th book. This is to assist in searching if you know which verse you are looking for. Due to time considerations I have omitted most of the introduction and the annotations.] 
127-136),seems to be a verbatim repetition of mantras contained in the Rig-veda being employed in the Vaitana- sura at the sastras and stotras of the soma-sacrifice: it is altogether foreign to the spirit of the original Atharvan. The nineteenth book is a late addendum in general very corrupt; its omission (with the exception of hymns 
26,34 35 38 39 53 and 54) does not detract much from the general impression left by the body of the collection. The seventeenth book consists of a single hymn of inferior interest. Again books XV and XVI the former entirely Brahmanical prose the latter almost entirely so are of doubtful quality and chronology. Finally books XIV and XVIII contain respectively the wedding and funeral stanzas of the Atharvan and are largely coincident with corresponding Mantras of the tenth book of the Rig-veda: they are granted their intrinsic interest not specifically Atharvanic. Of the rest of the Atharvan (books I-XIII) there is presented here about one half naturally that half which seemed to the translator the most interesting and characteristic. Since not a little of the collection rises scarcely above the level of mere verbiage the process of exclusion has not called for any great degree of abstemiousness.

1411,
15.,Charm for the removal of evil characteristics and the acquisition of auspicious ones. 
1,. Fly forth from here O evil mark vanish from here fly forth to yonder place ! Upon him that hates us do we fasten thee with a brazen hook. 
2.,The unsavoury mark which flying has alighted upon me as a creeper upon a tree that mayest thou put away from us away from here O golden-handed 
3.,Together with the body of the mortal from his birth one and a hundred marks are bom. Those that are most foul do we drive away from here; the auspicious ones O Gatavedas (Agni) do thou hold fast for us ! 
4.,These (marks) here I have separated as cows scattered upon the heather. The pure marks shall remain the foul ones I have made to disappear! 
1.,The gods O king did not give to thee this (Cow) to eat. Do not O prince seek to devour the cow of the Brahmana which is unfit to be eaten! 
2.,The prince beguiled by dice the wretched one who has lost as a stake his own person he may perchance eat the cow of the Brahmana (thinking) 'let me live to-day (if) not to-morrow'! 
3.,Enveloped (is she) in her skin as an adder with evil poison; do not O prince (eat the cow) of the Brahmana: sapless unfit to be eaten is that cow! 
4.,Away does (the Brahmana) take regal power destroys vigour; like fire which has caught does he burn away everything. He that regards the Brahmana as fit food drinks of the poison of the taimata-serpent. 
5.,He who thinks him (the Brahman) mild and slays him he who reviles the gods lusts after wealth without thought in his heart Indra kindles a fire; him both heaven and earth hate while he lives. 
6.,The Brahmana must not be encroached upon any more than fire by him that regards his own body! For Soma is his (the Brahmana's) heir Indra protects him from hostile plots. 
7.,He swallows her (the cow) bristling with a hundred hooks (but) is unable to digest her he the fool who devouring the food of the Brahmans thinks 'I am eating a luscious (morsel).' 
1412,
8.,(The Brahman's) tongue turns into a bow. string his voice into the neck of an arrow; his windpipe his teeth are bedaubed with holy fire: with these the Brahman strikes those who revile the gods by means of bows that have the strength to reach the heart discharged by the gods. 
9.,The Brahmanas have sharp arrows are armed with missiles the arrow whi eh they hurl goes not in vain; pursuing him with their holy fire and their wrath even from afar do they pierce him. 
10.,They who ruled over a thousand and were themselves ten hundred the Vaitahavya when they devoured the cow of the Brahmana perished. 
11.,The cow herself when slaughtered came down upon the Vaitahavyas. who had roasted for themselves the last she-goat of Kesaraprabandha. 
12.,The one hundred and one persons whom the earth did cast off because they had injured the offspring of a Brahmana were ruined irretrievably. 
13.,As a reviler of the gods does he live among mortals having swallowed poison he becomes more bone (than flesh). He that injureth a Brahmana whose kin are the gods does not reach heaven by the road of the Fathers. 
14.,Agni is called our guide Soma our heir Indra slays those who curse (us): that the strong (sages) know. 
15.,Like a poisoned arrow O king like -an adder O lord of cattle is the terrible arrow of the Brahmana: with that he smites those who revile (the gods). 
1.,Beyond measure they waxed strong just fell short of touching the heavens. When they infringed upon Bhrigu they perished the Sringaya Vaitahavyas. 
2.,The persons who pierced Brihatsaman the descendant of Angiras the Brahmana— a ram with two rows of teeth a sheep devoured their offspring. 
3.,They who spat upon the Brahmana who desired tribute from him they sit in the middle of a pool of blood chewing hair. 
4.,The cow of the Brahman when roasted as far as she reaches does she destroy the lustre of the kingdom; no lusty hero is bom (there). 
5.,A cruel (sacrilegious) deed is her slaughter her meat when eaten is sapless; when her milk is drunk that surely is accounted a crime against the Fathers. 
6.,When the king weening himself mighty desires to destroy the Brahmana then royal power is dissipated where the Brahmana is oppressed. 
7.,Becoming eight-footed four-eyed four-eared four-jawed two-mouthed two-tongued she dispels the rule of the oppressor of the Brahman. 
8.,That (kingdom) surely she swamps as water a leaking ship; misfortune strikes that kingdom in which they injure a Brahmana. 
9.,The trees chase away with the words: 'do not come within our shade' him who covets the 
1413,
10.,King Varuna pronounced this (to be) poison prepared by the gods: no one who has devoured the cow of a Brahmana retains the charge of a kingdom. 
11.,Those full nine and ninety whom the earth did cast off because they had injured the offspring of a Brahmana were ruined irretrievably. 
12.,The kudi-plant (Christ's thorn) that wipes away the track (of death) which they fasten to the dead that very one O oppressor of Brahmans the gods did declare (to be) thy couch. 
13.,The tears which have rolled from (the eyes of) the oppressed (Brahman) as he laments these very ones O oppressor of Brahmans the gods did assign to thee as thy share of water. 
14.,The water with which they bathe the dead with which they moisten his beard that very one O oppressor of Brahmans the gods did assign to thee as thy share of water. 
15.,The rain of Mitra and Varuna does not moisten the oppressor of Brahmans; the assembly is not complacent for him he does not guide his friend according to his will. 
1.,Bring (wealth) to us do not stand in our way O Arati; do not keep from us the sacrificial reward as it is being taken (to us)! Adoration be to the power of grudge the power of failure adoration to Arati ! 
2.,To thy advising minister whom thou Arati didst make thy agent do we make obeisance. Do not bring failure to my wish! 
3.,May our wish instilled by the gods be fulfilled by day and night! We go in quest of Arati. Adoration be to Arati ! 
4.,Sarasvati (speech) Anumati (favour) and Bhaga (fortune) we go to invoke. Pleasant honied words I have spoken on the occasions when the gods were invoked. 
5.,Him whom I implore with Vak Sarasvati (the goddess-of speech) the yoke-fellow of thought faith shall find to-day bestowed by the brown soma! 
6.,Neither our wish nor our speech do thou frustrate! May Indra and Agni both bring us wealth! Do ye all who to-day desire to make gifts to us gain favour with Arati! 
7.,Go far away failure! Thy missile do we avert. I know thee (to be) oppressive and piercing O Arati! 
8.,Thou dost even transform thyself into a naked woman and attach thyself to people in their sleep frustrating O Arati the thought and intention of man. 
9.,To her who great and of great dimension did penetrate all the regions to this golden-locked Nirriti (goddess of misfortune) I have rendered obeisance. 
10.,To the gold-complexioned lovely one who rests upon golden cushions to the great one to that Arati who wears golden robes I have rendered obeisance. 
1414,
1.,'I give' he shall surely say 'the sterile cow to the begging Brahmans'— and they have noted her- -that brings progeny and offspring ! 
2.,With his offspring does he trade of his cattle is he deprived that refuses to give the cow of the gods to the begging descendants of the Rishis. 
3.,Through (the gift of) a cow with broken horns his (cattle) breaks down through a lame one he tumbles into a pit through a mutilated one his house is burned through a one-eyed one his property is given away. 
4.,Flow of blood attacks the cattle-owner from the spot where her dung is deposited: this understanding there is about the vasa (the sterile cow); for thou (sterile cow) art said to be very difficult to deceive! 
5.,From the resting-place of her feet the (disease) called viklindu overtakes (the owner or the cattle). Without sickness breaks down (the cattle) which she sniffs upon with her nose. 
6.,He that pierces her ears is estranged from the gods. He thinks: 'I am making a mark (upon her)' (but) he diminishes his own property. 
7.,If any one for whatsoever purpose cuts her tail then do his colts die and the wolf tears his calves. 
8.,If a crow has injured her hair as long as she is with her owner then do his children die: decline overtakes them without (noticeable) sickness. 
9.,If the serving-maid sweeps together her dung that bites as lye there arises from this sin disfigurement that passeth not away. 
10.,The sterile cow in her very birth is bom for the gods and Brahmanas. Hence to the Brahmans she is to be given: that they say guarantees the security of one's own property. 
11.,For those that come requesting her the cow has been created by the gods. Oppression of Brahmans it is called if he keeps her for himself. 
12.,He that refuses to give the cow of the gods to the descendants of the Rishis who ask for it infringes upon the gods and the wrath of the Brahmanas. 
13.,Though he derives benefit from this sterile cow another (cow) then shall he seek! When kept she injures (his) folk if he refuses to give her after she has been asked for! 
14.,The sterile cow is as a treasure deposited for die Brahmanas: they come here for her with whomsoever she is born. 
15.,The Brahmanas come here for their own when they come for the sterile cow. The refusal of her is as though he were oppressing them in other concerns. 
1415,
17.,If he denies that she is sterile a treasure deposited for the gods then Bhava and Sarva both come upon him and hurl their arrow upon him. 
18.,Though he does not perceive upon her either udder or tits yet both yield him milk if he has prevailed upon himself to give away the sterile cow. 
19.,Hard to cheat she oppresses him if when asked for he refuses to give her. His desires are not fulfilled if he aims to accomplish them without giving her away. 
20.,The gods did ask for the sterile cow making the Brahmana their mouthpiece. The man that does not give (her) enters into the wrath of all of these. 
21.,Into the wrath of the cattle enters he that gives not the sterile cow to the Brahmanas; if he the mortal appropriates the share deposited for the gods. 
22.,Even if a hundred other Brahmanas beg the owner for the sterile cow yet the gods did say anent her: The cow belongs to him that knoweth thus.' 
23.,He that refuses the sterile cow to him that knoweth thus and gives her to others difficult to dwell upon is for him the earth with her divinities. 
24.,The gods did beg the sterile cow of him wilh whom she was born at first. That very one Narada recognised and drove forth in company with the gods. 
25.,The sterile cow renders childless and poor in cattle him that yet appropriates her when she has been begged for by the Brahmanas. 
26.,For Agni and Soma for Kama for Mitra and for Varuna for these do the Brahmanas beg her: upon these he infringes if he gl ves her not. 
27.,As long as the owner does not himself hear the stanzas referring to (the giving away of) her she may herd among his cattle; (only) if he has not heard (them) may she pass the night in his house. 
28.,He that has listened to the stanzas yet has permitted her to herd among the cattle his life and prosperity the angry gods destroy. 
29.,The sterile cow even when she rambles freely is a treasure deposited for the gods. Make evident thy true nature when thou desirest to go to thy (proper) stable! 
30.,She makes evident her nature when she desires to go to her (proper) stable. Then indeed the sterile cow puts it into the minds of the Brahmans to beg (for her). 
31.,She evolves it in her mind that (thought) reaches the gods. Then do the Brahmans come to beg for the sterile cow. 
32.,The call svadha befriends him with the Fathers the sacrifice with the gods. Through the gift of the sterile cow the man of royal caste incurs not the anger of (her) his mother. 
33.,The sterile cow is the mother of the man of royal caste: thus was it from the beginning. It is said to be no (real) deprivation if she is given to the Brahmans. 
34.,As if he were to rob the ghee ladled up for Agni (the fire) from the (very) spoon thus if he gives not the sterile cow to the Brahmans does he infringe upon Agni. 
35.,The sterile cow has the purodasa (sacrificial cake) for her calf she yields plentiful milk helps in this world and fulfils all wishes for him that gives her (to the Brahmans). 
36.,The sterile cow fulfils all wishes in the kingdom of Yama for him that gives her. But they say 
1416,
37.,The sterile cow even if she should become fruitful lives in anger at her owner: 'since he did regard me as sterile (without giving me to the Brahmans) he shall be bound in the fetters of death!' 
38.,He who thinks that the cow is sterile and (yet) roasts her at home even his children qnd grandchildren Brihaspati causes to be importuned (for her). 
39.,Fiercely does the (supposed) sterile cow burn when she herds with the cattle though she be a (fruitful) cow. She verily too milks poison for the owner that does not present her. 
40.,It pleases the cattle when she is given to the Brahmans; moreover the sterile cow is pleased when she is made an offering to the gods (Brahmans). 
41.,From the sterile cows which the gods returning from the sacrifice created Narada picked out as (most) terrible the vilipti. 
42.,In reference to her the gods reflected: 'Is she a sterile cow or not?' And Narada in reference to her said: 'Of sterile cows she is the most sterile!' 
43.,'How many sterile cows (are there) O Narada which thou knowest to be born among men?' About these do I ask thee that knowest: 'Of which may the non-Brahmana not eat?' 
44.,Of the vilipti of her that has bom a sterile cow and of the sterile cow (herself) the non- Brahmana that hopes for prosperity shall not eat! 
45.,Reverence be to thee O Narada that knowest thoroughly which sterile cow is the most terrible by withholding which (from the Brahmans) destruction is.incurred. 
46.,The vilipti O Brihaspati her that has begotten a sterile cow and the sterile cow (herself) the non-Brahmana that hopes for prosperity shall not eat! 
47.,Three kinds forsooth of sterile cows are there: the vilipti she that has begotten a sterile cow and the sterile cow (herself). These he shall give to the Brahmans; (then) does he not estrange himself from Pragapati. 
48.,'This is your oblation O Brahmanas' thus shall he reflect if he is supplicated if they ask him for the sterile cow terrible in the house of him that refuses to give her. 
49.,The gods animadverted in reference to Bheda and the sterile cow angry because he had not given her in these verses-and therefore he (Bheda) perished. 
50.,Bheda did not present the sterile cow though requested by Indra: for this sin the gods crushed him in battle. 
51.,The counsellors that advise the withholding (of the sterile cow) they the rogues in their folly conflict with the wrath of Indra. 
52.,They who lead the owner of cattle aside then say to him: 'do not give' in their folly they run into the missile hurled by Rudra. 
53.,And if he roasts the sterile cow at home whether he makes a sacrifice of her or not he sins against the gods and Brahmanas and as a cheat falls from heaven. 
1417,
1.,O Agni come into being! Aditi here in her throes longing for sons is cooking the porridge for the Brahmans The seven Rishis that did create the beings shall here churn thee along with progeny!

16.,O Agni the sacrificial pot has settled upon thee: do thou shining brightly glowing heat it with thy glow! May the divine descendants of the Rishis assembled about their share (of the porridge) full of fervour heat this (pot) at the proper time! 
17.,Pure and clear may these sacrificial women the waters bright flow into the pot! The) have given us abundant offspring and cattle. May he that cooks the porridge go to the world of the pious (heaven)!
