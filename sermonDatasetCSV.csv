""In"" such a misuse of ""wine"" as ""drunkenness,"" ""dissipation""--Lit.='lack of salvation'--is embodied. ""Drunkenness"" is therefore, not a disease, as some would have us believe.

Dissipation ""is a waste of resources that should be submitted to Jesus.""--David Guzik In fact, rather than being 'filled' with ""wine,"" Christians are to ""be filled with the Spirit"" of God.

Acts 2:1-18--""When the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, & it filled the whole house where they were sitting. Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of fire, & one sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit & began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven. And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together, & were confused, because everyone heard them speak in his own language. Then they were all amazed & marveled, saying to one another, ""Look, are not all these who speak Galileans? And how is it that we hear, each in our own language in which we were born? Parthians & Medes & Elamites, those dwelling in Mesopotamia, Judea & Cappadocia, Pontus & Asia, ""Phrygia & Pamphylia, Egypt & the parts of Libya adjoining Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews & proselytes, Cretans & Arabs--we hear them speaking in our own tongues the wonderful works of God."" So they were all amazed & perplexed, saying to one another, ""Whatever could this mean?"" Others mocking said, ""They are full of new wine.""

Romans 3:21-26,"('Faith', 'Justification', 'Righteousness', 'Justify')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Romans 3:21-26 The Doctrine on Which the Church Stands or Falls 1/1/17 D. Marion Clark Introduction Who knows what a year will bring? Five hundred years ago, an obscure monk had no idea that he would be used by God to bring about the most momentous impact on the church since it became the official religion of the Roman Empire, 1,200 hundred years earlier. On October 31, All Hallows' Eve, the Augustinian monk and professor at the university in Wittenberg nailed 95 theses on the door of the church. They were written in Latin for the purpose of debate among church scholars. They were written to address a specific corrupt practice - that of selling indulgences, which were being sold to raise money for the building of St. Peter's basilica in Rome. The lead marketer had gone beyond the bounds of integrity, promising immediate release of relatives in purgatory to any who put money in the coffers. Other than scholarly debate with colleagues, Luther expected little reaction. Instead, someone took down the document, translated it into the common language, and distributed it throughout the land. It was the original social media viral event, and so began the Reformation. That was the beginning of the chain of events which culminated in the break within the Roman Catholic Church and birthed the Protestant Church. But the selling of indulgences was not at the heart of what led to the division in the church. What became the central issue and the central doctrine over which the two branches of the Christian faith remain divided is that of justification. What does it mean to be justified before God and how does one become justified - it is the understanding of that doctrine which divides us to this day. It is this doctrine that the Reformers proclaimed that the Church stands or falls. For the next five weeks we will take a look at five doctrines that are identified as the central tenets of the Protestant faith. They are referred to as the five soli, Sola is Latin for ""sole"" or ""only."" They are, in the order we will treat them: sola fide, faith alone; soli gratia, grace alone; solus Christus, Christ alone; sola scriptura, Scripture alone; and soli Deo gloria, for God's glory alone. The doctrine that underlies the first three - faith, grace, and Christ alone - is that of justification. Let's take time to understand it and what it means for us. Our Scripture text provides an excellent study for the doctrine. Text But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it-- 22 the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: 23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, 25 whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. 26 It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus."
Acts 2:42-47,"('Loneliness', 'Isolation', 'Small Groups', 'Friendship General')",Christian/Church Of Christ," 1. Quiet Desperation of Loneliness Sophie and Shirley, two elderly widows in a Florida adult community, are curious about the latest arrival in their building -- a quiet, nice looking gentleman who keeps to himself. Shirley says, ""Sophie, you know I'm shy. Why don't you go over to him at the pool and find out a little about him. He looks so lonely."" Sophie agrees, and later that day at the pool, she walks up to him and says, ""Excuse me, mister. I hope I'm not prying, but my friend and I were wondering why you looked so lonely."" ""Of course I'm lonely, he says, ""I've spent the past 20 years in prison."" ""You're kidding! What for?"" ""For killing my third wife. I strangled her."" ""What happened to your second wife?"" ""I shot her."" ""And, if I may ask, your first wife?"" ""We had a fight and she fell off a bridge."" ""Oh my,"" says Sophie. Then turning to her friend on the other side of the pool, she yells, ""You're never going to believe this, Shirley. He's single."" Have you ever been so hungry for a friend that you made a poor decision? Believe it or not, like it or not our need for friends is one of our most urgent needs. Sometimes the need overwhelms us so much that we are willing to do anything to feel loved, from going home with a stranger to striking up conversations with telemarketers. We live in an increasingly isolating society and we are willing to do almost anything to not feel lonely. Today Show, December 27, 2016: Match.com Scam: Believing in long-distance love, Betty Davies fell victim to a romance scam on Match.com. Davies wired a ""love interest"" scammer her life savings, a whopping $270,000, which left her with nothing. She thought the person with whom she was corresponding was legitimately interested in her. She believed his phony stories and financial requests in spite of something telling her it was a scam until she had given him all of her savings. Proverbs 12:26 The righteous choose their friends carefully, but the way of the wicked leads them astray. Sometimes it appears that we will do anything to feel accepted. As Americans we are among the loneliest people in the world. As a culture we are radically much different than we were a generation ago or even a decade ago. ATM machines allow us to do our banking without talking to anyone. In fact most banks have the option of convenience with online Internet banking. Incredibly convenient but there is a loss of personal touch. Walk into almost any large store and they provide you with the option of self check-out system. Or gas up at the station by paying at the pump. Social Media; Internet Payments Over the past few decades we have become more isolationist as a society.

Psalms 38:5-8,"('David', 'Depression', 'Weary', 'Sadness')",Pentecostal," THE HALL OF FAITH Hebrews 11:29-12:2 1. In the earlier verses of Hebrews 11, the 'Hall of Faith' (as I have called it) spoke of faithful individuals, ranging from Abel through Abraham to Moses. Now we have a shift to the plural, emphasising the collective faith of all involved. ""By faith THEY passed through the sea"" (Hebrews 11:29). 'Show me your faith without your works,' says James, 'and I will show you my faith by my works' (James 2:18). Without the practical application of faith in their lives, the children of Israel would still be standing there beside the Red Sea when the Egyptians caught up with them. The order of the day, 'Stand still and see the salvation of the LORD' was closely followed by, 'Move forward' (Exodus 14:13-15). Not only does the obedience of faith (Hebrews 11:8) belong to the faithful, but those without faith were ""swallowed up"" by the sea (Hebrews 11:29). A generation later the walls of Jericho, symbol of Canaanite strength, came a-tumbling down - but only after the Israelites had faithfully, and obediently, walked around them for seven days (Hebrews 11:30). 2. Returning to the roll-call of individuals, we are reminded that ""the faith"" is not the sole preserve of one group of people. Rahab was a lonely believer in a condemned community (Joshua 2:9-11), but did not fail to put her faith into action (Hebrews 11:31). Furthermore, God's care of His covenant people did not necessarily pick out the most deserving, nor even the most likely (Hebrews 11:32). In the generalities that follow (Hebrews 11:33-38), we are able to recognise certain people from the Old Testament, and from the 400 years between the Hebrew Bible and the Christian New Testament. There are two main groups: those who persevered and overcame (Hebrews 11:33-35); and those who suffered and (in some instances) were martyred (Hebrews 11:35-38). It is no coincidence, coming so soon as it does after Hebrews 11:36-38, that the Greek word for ""witness"" (Hebrews 12:1) gives us the English word for 'martyr'. The list is left unfinished: it is unfinished yet (Hebrews 11:39-40). Yet what remains is the variety of people and circumstances through which the LORD has fulfilled, and is fulfilling His purposes. We are not clones or drones, and our callings may vary, but we are all part of the same team. 3. Hebrews 12 begins with a doubly strengthened form of the particle, usually translated ""therefore"" (for that reason), or more correctly ""wherefore"" (as a result of which). This is so that we do not miss the connection with what has gone before: ""since"" we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, ""consequently..."" There follows an exhortation based on the roll-call of the faithful in the previous chapter. This great throng is envisaged as ""encompassing"" us, surrounding us like the environs of a district, enclosing us like a crowd in a stadium. Yet they are not just on the touchline, cheering us on, but very much a part of us (Hebrews 11:40). They are called ""witnesses"" not because they are armchair spectators, but fellow-participants in the mutual and collective ""race"" (Hebrews 12:1)."
Galatians 4:21-31,"('Grace', 'Law', 'Promise', 'Legalism')",Evangelical Free," Mary Hickey talks about the time when she was expecting her first baby. Then, a six-year-old neighbor girl was particularly curious. She wanted to see the baby furniture and hear her list of possible names. When she asked where the baby was, Mary was a walking show-and-tell even at four months. But then the six-year-old asked Mary the question that probably had been foremost in her mind: ""How did the baby get in there?"" Mary replied, ""I think you'd better ask your mother about that."" ""Oh, I tried that,"" the little girl confessed. ""Nobody in my family knows!"" (Mary L. Hickey, Kirkersville, Ohio, Christian Reader, ""Kids of the Kingdom""; www.PreachingToday.com) It's certainly important for young people to know, at the appropriate time, the facts of their physical birth. But it's even more important for us followers of Christ to know the facts of our spiritual birth. It's important, because that determines whether we live our lives in freedom or in bondage. So, if you have your Bibles, I invite you to turn with me to Galatians 4, Galatians 4, where God's Word presents the facts of our spiritual birth. Galatians 4:21-23 Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not listen to the law? For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and one by a free woman. But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, while the son of the free woman was born through promise. (ESV) The first book of the Law, the book of Genesis, makes it very clear that Abraham had two children with two different mothers. One was a slave. Her name was Hagar, and she gave birth to Ishmael. The other mother was free. Her name was Sarah, and she gave birth to Isaac. Now, in Bible days, the status of the mother determined the status of her children. If the mother was a slave, then her children were slaves, even if their father was a king. On the other hand, if the mother was free, then her children were free, even if their father was a slave. So, spiritually speaking, who is YOUR mother? Is she a slave or is she free? Abraham had two different children with two different mother, and these two children had two different methods of birth. They were born in two different ways. Hagar, the slave's son was born ""according to the flesh"" (vs.23). And Sarah, the free-woman's son was born ""through promise,"" i.e., through a miracle. God had promised Abraham and Sarah many descendants, as many as the stars in the heavens, but nothing was happening over the years. Abraham and Sarah were growing old, and still they didn't have even one son, much less ""many descendants."" So when Abraham turned 85 years old and Sarah turned 75, they decided to help God out. By their own efforts, in their own flesh, they were going to secure God's promised blessing. Sarah gave her slave-girl, Hagar, to Abraham as his second wife, and they had a son in the ordinary way. Ishmael was born according to the flesh, as a result of a man trying to get God's promised blessing through his own human efforts."
Mark 11:25,"('Forgiveness', 'Forgiveness For Others', 'Mercy Of God', 'Love  For Enemies')",Pentecostal," Mark 2:7-11 (Wey) ""Why does this man use such words?"" they said; ""He is blaspheming. Who can pardon sins but One--that is, God?""... Jesus asked them, ""Which is easier?--to say to this paralytic, 'Your sins are pardoned,' or to say, 'Rise, take up your mat, and walk?' But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to pardon sins""--He turned to the paralytic, and said, ""To you I say, 'Rise, take up your mat and go home.'"" Conditional Forgiveness Mat 6:12 (TEB) ""Forgive us the wrongs that we have done, as we forgive the wrongs others have done us."" Luke 6:37 (NIV) ""...Forgive, and you will be forgiven."" Mat 6:14-15 (NIV) ""For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But, if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins."" "" Assuming the teaching of Mat 6:15 and other such verses is understood and acknowledged as true, rather than emphasize the need to forgive in this Bible study--i.e., the law--we will instead look at five cheap substitutes or impediments to forgiveness, and then at what real forgiveness is, how to attain it, and how to remain in it. And we may find that forgiveness is more difficult, and more easy, than we first thought. Sin Is Only Human... "" What is natural to ""the flesh"" (the carnal nature) when we have been hurt or abused or insulted is to strike back, to plot revenge, or to simmer in bitterness. This is ""only human"". But God requires forgiveness, else He will NOT forgive us. If we are unwilling--or unable--to forgive, then there is no use asking God for what He has told us He will not give. For believers, dealing with the sin of unforgiveness is first priority. Mark 11:25 (NIV) ""And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins."" "" As a way to test the veracity of the following points, let us consider forgiveness in the most radical sense we can. Think of something truly wicked that has been done to you or someone you love, not by accident or error but deliberately and with malice--where you have come right up against evil and the pain caused by it in your own emotions. 1) What Forgiveness Is Not: Play Acting For Show... "" Remember when as a child you were forced by some adult to ""forgive"" someone who was first forced to ""say sorry"" to you? Is this really repentance by the perpetrator... or forgiveness by the victim? Well, perhaps so--in a few rare cases. But let us be honest and acknowledge that this charade by children is more often a temporary cessation of hostilities for the sake of the grown-ups, with the full intent to do more of the same violence (and not get caught) and/or get revenge later--when beyond the adult's watchful eye. "" Adults force children through this ritual because strife in a family or group of kids is an unbearable pain; and they want to teach. Play-acting does give at least a temporary reprieve. But God's pain is more acute when He sees our strife with each other, and His solution aims a little deeper than mere words or mimicry or delay or coating over. For He is aiming not at hypocritical play-acting, but at truth from the inside out."
James 4:7,"('Fornicacion', 'Temptation And Sin', 'Sin And Evil', 'Sexual Desire')",Pentecostal," Our response to Satan's lies (Eph 2:8-9; 1 John 4:1; James 4:7): "" We are to submit to God's will (2 Cor. 11:3, 14-15). Satan's ways look good and appealing, but God's way is the way that is best; Satan's way is death. It is better to be poor and honest than rich and dishonest! "" We are to obey God's will (2 Tim. 3:16). This is our sure-fire response to temptation, just as our Lord used! "" We are to focus on the Cross (John 14:6). We are to ignore the human standards, remember that Jesus died for us, and know that no sin is too big for Him to deal with and forgive. No matter what we have gone through, He is there for us, loving us. Satan wants us to diminish the cross by adding to it with penance; Christ wants us to repent! "" We need to commit to God's Purpose (1 Timothy 4:1-3; Luke 8:11-12; John 11:25-26), not our will and dreams and aspirations, but need totally to surrender to Christ all of our plans and desires no matter where it takes us. "" Remember Satan's pride brought him down (How is your pride doing?) to the lowest of levels, and he is certain of his fate. His current ambition is to deceive as many of humanity as possible, to share with him in his fate. "" God gives all of the armor we need to defend ourselves (2 Cor. 10:4). So, we are to trust Him and use Him and His gifts and tools! We are to have them on and be holding them, and using them, especially militant prayer! It is our responsibility to have the armor of God on and to be ready to be attacked. If we are watchful and prepared, then we are ready for the attack of the devil, his demons, and those fiery darts. We may not all know how to attack with the Sword of the Spirit, which is why we have the rest of the armor. If we are not ready to properly use the Sword of the Spirit, then we need to do as II Timothy 2:15 calls us to do: ""Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."" When we have all of the gear of the armor, then we are to, ""With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints"" (Eph 6:18)"
2 Corinthians 10:3-5,"('Heart', 'Mouth', 'Heart  Focus', 'Carnal Mind', 'Tongue Is A Fire')",Pentecostal," YOUR MIND. The devil loves to put thoughts into your mind. You can be born-again and heaven-bound, but if you have wrong thoughts, your effectiveness on earth is greatly diminished. We must war against thoughts that don't agree with the truth. Analyze your thoughts. Just say to yourself, ""Hey, thoughts! Where did you come from?"" If it's a thought of pride, fear, unbelief, lust depression, or condemnation, it needs to be cast down. That's something you have to do. Refuse to dwell on it. Turn your mind to God and make it agree with His Word. (2 Cor. 10:3-5) YOUR HEART. In this case, your ""heart"" means your attitudes and emotions. Wrong attitudes are killers. In Ephesians 4:27, we learn that as Christians we give opportunity to the devil if we don't deal with our wrong attitudes. Arrogant, rebellious, unforgiving, and contentious attitudes open up a door for the enemy to enter our life, marriage, church, nation, and world. The devil only has access to the world through people's sin and selfishness. Jesus defeated every demonic power on the cross 2,000 years ago - but Satan is still active to the exact degree people allow him to be. Sinners are not the only ones allowing him to work. Christians allow him to work when we don't deal with our wrong attitudes. Ephesians 4:26 tells us, ""Do not let the sun go down on your anger."" So we must deal with any wrong attitudes on a regular basis - like taking a shower or brushing our teeth. It's something we must do. We ""put off,"" the old man and ""put on"" the new man. That keeps the devil shut down. Proverbs 4:23 says, ""Keep your heart with all diligence..."" YOUR MOUTH. The mouth is a powerful instrument and the devil knows it. Our mouth has spiritual power for either good or evil. The same mouth can pronounce a blessing or a curse. (Jas. 3:10) Our words can be a vehicle for the human spirit, the Holy Spirit, or an evil spirit. The enemy loves to inspire us to speak unbelief, slander, gossip, and hurtful, harsh sarcasm. Many of us carry wounds from things said to us years ago. Don't let the devil bring curses through your mouth. Think! Pray what David prayed in Psalm 141:3, ""Set a guard, O Lord, over my mouth; keep watch over the door of my lips."""
John 20:1-18,"('Faith', 'Woman', 'Loyalty')",Christian/Church Of Christ," I HAVE SEEN THE LORD! John 20:1-18 I suppose that one of the reasons that I like history is the fact that it is chronological.

History is like reading a book - the plot doesn't change - and it's not like a math problem or scientific theory. And when test time comes; if you know your facts you will do well on the test. History is rock solid. And, in the historical account of Jesus, every legitimate historian validates that Jesus walked on this earth some 2,000 years ago. There has been a plethora of evidence both for and against the existence of Jesus. And after weighing all the evidence the pro-Jesus camp is on solid ground. The ministry and message of Jesus - his life; his teachings; and his miracles are widely accepted truths. There is hard evidence that he was crucified on a Roman Cross and three days later resurrected to life again. Only a small segment of society deny these things. With that being said, What are we to make about the resurrection of Jesus? And, in the theme of this series, Have you seen Jesus? One of the most striking things about the Resurrection accounts as they are written in all four Gospels is that women were the first ones at the empty tomb, the first to meet the Risen Jesus, and the first to tell others they had seen Him. With the cultural divide, that may be difficult for us to understand today. But from a historical standpoint this is important. Women, at the time of Christ, were not considered to be credible witnesses. Jewish Rabbis are quoted as saying, ""It is better that the words of the Law be burned than be delivered to a woman ."" And, no one in the ancient world would have made the story about the resurrection up! Jewish men would not have a conversation with a woman in public and even his wife would have to walk behind him. Women were considered chattel property and had no rights. So, that is why the gospel accounts are so striking; so earth-shattering. The women were the first to the tomb. The women were the first ones to see the resurrected Savior of the world! They were the first to believe. Jewish men might well have liked to air-brush this story - but it is about the women - a segment of society that had no political, social or religious power. To say the least, Jesus' ministry was unconventional. His followers were not the upper-crust of society. His followers were commoners for the most part. They followed his teachings because of his heart. Love God and love others had deep meaning and appeal. Turn the other cheek was a radical and difficult application. Humility then as well as today is difficult to put into practice. The man whom they had followed had been crucified on a torturous Roman cross and buried. Their hopes and dreams seemed to be buried with the man whom they had invested their beliefs. But, then ... let's read the text:"

John 2:1-11,"('Obedience', 'Miracles', 'Miracle')",Baptist," TITLE: MISS MARY SAID.... SCRIPTURE: ST. JOHN 2:1-11 I am excited this morning, this First Day of the Year and First Sunday of the New Year 2017. Not sure where the Holy Spirit will take us this year as we preach from this Pulpit, however; I believe we have a message this morning, this first sermon of the year and it will shape and focus our direction throughout the year. I believe this message this morning will be reflective therefore, we will be able to reach back to it all year long. Go with me to a very familiar text found in the Gospel According to ST. JOHN 2:1-11 (Read) - I lift as a thought on this New Year - Ms. Mary Said. I know we have heard this text preached throughout the years, I want to ask you to stay with me this morning as I believe we will examine beneath the covers of this text and discover some real truths that will give us the framework to have a successful walk with Christ throughout the year and throughout our lives. Come with me and let's go visit the scene that begins to unfold before us at this wedding in Cana of Galilee. The text tells us it is the third day - which means the first day of the wedding celebration. "" The Music has started "" The Dancing has begun "" Guests are spread out on the floors enjoying the food and evidently really enjoying the beverages "" And then....Something has gone horribly wrong "" Either too many family members and guests showed up or else someone really overestimated the contents of their wine rack Something went wrong at this wedding Jesus attended. They ran out of wine, which would have been a big thing in that culture. "" Weddings were community events that lasted several days and involved countless details "" There was always at least a year between the betrothal and wedding "" This allowed plenty of time to plan the days big event "" The party was a sign of faith in God, and the connection of God between God's people "" People came together in celebration "" People celebrate Love, Community and God I believe we need to get back to this in our culture today. There is no longer a dating process - we go straight for the dessert. Don't hardly know the person we marry and wonder why we separate within first two years. Too much dessert can make you diabetic. In our text the betroval process lasted for a year, this was the time the couple spend really getting to know each other and planning - EMOTIONALLY - SPIRITUALLY - FINANCIALLY - to spend their lives together. The couple relied on God to work on them. Not so today, we rely on - "" Dating Dot.com "" Farmers Dating Dot.com "" Match Dot.com "" eHarmony Dot.com We need to get back to GOD DOT.COM and we will begin to see more of a celebration when couples get married, returning to Christ being the center of each relationship. We seem to be surprised today and clap when we hear of that couple around us that is celebrating 20 - 30 - 35 - 40 - 50 years of marriage. What are we clapping for? It should be normal for married couples to be married to one another all the days of their lives."

Philippians 3:12-14,"('Perseverance', 'Press On', 'Straining Forward')",Baptist," Straining Forward Philippians 3:12-14 January 1, 2017 I remember many, many years ago, when I was just a young kid - - - I remember being outside with a basketball and shooting baskets. There would come a time during my shooting where you would have a final countdown. The game is on the line. It's the NBA championship, and I get a pass from Michael Jordan . . . I make a move, shoot as the clock hits zero and - - - - I miss! UGH! Ever been there? But here's the beauty . . . it's all imagination. I guess I never heard the whistle for the time out. Then I shoot again, and miss again! Oh, but wait, I was fouled by that imaginary player. The scenes play out time after time, and you know what? Somehow my team never, ever loses the game. Something always happens to help me get another chance to win the game. We've entered the new year 2017! I wonder how long it will take me to get that straight in my head, it's a new year, a new number to write down. One thing is for sure, we've all missed that last shot. But it's okay! It really is, and today is a great reminder that it's okay! It's good to be able to start over fresh. This week most students will return to school, as will some college students. Most of us are recovering from the Christmas activities and have already forgotten about the festivities of the past couple of weeks. Many are back at work after vacations. What do you anticipate for this year? Are you full of enthusiasm, passion and eagerly looking forward to what each day of this new year will bring? Or are you filled with a sense of dread, worried that this year will be worse than last year? I would have to say, just like most of us when we miss that shot, but eventually win the game with that same shot, it's your mindset, your attitude, your reaction to events which will determine whether this is a year of victory or a year of defeat. The Apostle Paul was never one to let circumstances defeat him. With God's help, he was determined to win the victor's crown. Listen as his attitude, dedication, and determination shine through in these words found from Philippians 3:12-14. Paul wrote these words to the people of Philippi, while sitting in prison ~ 12 Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me His own. 13 Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, 14 I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. Paul is referring to prior verses in Philippians 3. He wants the people of Philippi to know he has not reached the goal yet. His goal is the resurrection! For this to occur in Paul's life, he believes and hopes he may suffer for the glory of Christ. That he would be used by God in any manner God chooses, so that the message of Christ is passed on. Paul wanted the Philippians to understand he didn't have all of the answers. He had not already obtained the resurrection or for that matter been made perfect. He still lived in a fallen world. He was still a sinner and a sinner could not attain perfection in this world."
"Matthew 7:13-14, Luke 13:23-7:24","('Faith', 'Trust And Obey')",Baptist," HOW IS RIDING A BICYCLE LIKE BEING A CHRISTIAN? Wth a show of hands how many of you have ever ridden a bicycle? Many people say if you have ever been on a bicycle and have mastered breaking either on the pedals, or the grips on the handlebars, or the old Barnie Ruble way just sticking your feet down which I have done numerous times. You have mastered pedaling, steering, getting on and off with you and the bicycle going down. They say you never will forget how to ride a bicycle. As for me when I was much younger at the age of 10 year old Christmas morning I received my first bicycle. It was red in color with a small amount of white pinstripe with a headight on the front fender. The bike most likely was picked up by Santa Clause at the Western Auto. That morning I was so happy my own bike, I had been taught on a girls 26 inches bike as my cousin taught me how to ride, believe me it wasn't pretty. But back to Christmas morning I rolled my new bike out most likely around 5:30 in the morning to ride it to my Aunt and Uncle house which was right passed my grandmother house. Did I mention the big white oak that was four feet from the edge of the pig pen. This was the path we traveled daily to ride the bus to school, I had walked this same path it seemed thousands of times not deviating from the route I took each day. I never had any trouble with this route until that Christmas morning. As I left that early Christmas morning to ride to my Aunt, Uncle, and cousins house I cut the light on to guide me to my destination. As I rode the thoughts enter my mind my very own bicycle, as I pedaled faster I could see the shining metal from the glow of my front light. The faster I pedaled as I went through my Grandmother back yard passing the smoke house the faster I pedaled. I could see the pig pen and the large white oak coming into view. My objective was to spilt the distance between the pig pen and the tree the faster I pedaled. With all the excitement to this point I had forgotten the root that ran at a 90 degree angle from the white oak running directly toward the pig pen. My front tire hit the root and propled my self and my new red Western Flyer into the tree. I escaped with just a few scratches however my bike was not damaged except the front fender and the headlight that was all scratched, and dented up. The accident was completely my fault it wasn't caused by a deer running in my path, or I was talking or texting on my cell phone no it was caused by not paying attention to what I was doing. Since I have started my bicycle riding again it seems I still have accidents but as my Daddy use to tell get back up you sometimes will fail but don't let that stop you from trying. Well Pastor what that got to do with the message today? Please turn in your bibles to Matthew 7:13-14 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: 14. Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it."

"Proverbs 4:25-27, Luke 9:62","('Forward', 'Looking Ahead', 'Moving Ahead')",Christian/Church Of Christ," LOOKING AHEAD INTRODUCTION: People all over the world celebrate New Year's differently. I came across an interesting custom in some villages in Scotland. Barrels of tar are set ablaze and rolled through the streets, signifying the burning of the old year. Gives an attention-grabbing feel to the idea of out with the old; in with the new. But I guess in the idea of burning the old year you are not leaving any remnants behind to dwell on; you're focused on looking ahead. This isn't to say that there aren't any aspects of the old year to reflect on and remember fondly; of course there are. But in looking ahead we vow to put old regrets and old quarrels to rest. In looking ahead we are striving to replace old behaviors with new ones. Some things might follow us from the old year and there's not anything we can do about it except deal with them. But perhaps we deal with them in a new way or with a new attitude which can be more effective. Perhaps this is the year we finally get that monkey off our back. Perhaps this is the year we finally accomplish that long-time goal. Let's look ahead. 1) Eyes front! Prov. 4:25-27, ""Let your eyes look straight ahead, fix your gaze directly before you. Make level paths for your feet and take only ways that are firm. Do not swerve to the right or the left; keep your foot from evil."" Here we see a recipe for success in being able to look ahead and move forward. In looking ahead we are not being distracted by things in other directions. Looking ahead has with it a stated purpose of advancement. We are striving for reaching new plateaus. Therefore, in order to do that we need not lose our focus. Eyes front and keep it movin'! Don't look to the right or to the left but keep your eyes on the prize. Walk in the way that is solid and sure and that way is with Christ; all other ways are dangerous and treacherous. And don't look back! When God was about to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah the angel sent to rescue Lot, his wife and their daughters basically told them to keep it moving and don't look back. But Gen. 19:26 says that Lot's wife did look back and when she did she became a pillar of salt. She didn't look back in curiosity, she looked back in longing and sorrow. When we become born again we are called to not look back with fondness on our old lifestyle of sin with a desire to go back. That was Lot's wife's problem-she not only looked back, she desired to go back; she didn't want to let go. Jesus cited Lot's wife in Luke 17:28-33, ""It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building. But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all. ""It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed. On that day no one who is on the roof of his house, with his goods inside, should go down to get them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything. Remember Lot's wife! Whoever tries to keep his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life will preserve it."""
Matthew 11:28-30,"('Stress', 'Rest In Christ')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Finding Rest When You're Fully Stressed Matthew 11:28-30 Do you sometimes feel that life happens too fast and that you are always in a hurry? Do you feel overwhelmed with the demands and pressures of life? Do you feel exhausted? Have you lost your sense of excitement about living every day? Are you discouraged? Are you bombarded by a sense of worry or fear? Do you feel that you are carrying a heavy load and you feel like you can't take it anymore? God invites us to experience peace amidst the mess and chaos in our world. God offers us rest amidst our burdened, tired, and exhausted daily lives. Stress is a part of life. The question is NOT ""why do we experience stress?"" The question is ""what do we do when stress happens in our lives?"" We live in a very stressful world. Stress happens when there are tensions, pressures, threats, or demands, that you feel you are unable to cope with. These tensions, pressures, threats, or demands can come from outside you or from within you. We know we are stressed when we feel anxious, uneasy, tense, fearful or panicky just thinking about unpleasant situations, people or events. Our body is designed to experience a healthy dose of stress. Stress is our body's natural or instinctive survival response to cope with physical threat or danger. To cope with emergency situations, the body produces hormones or body fluids that allow us to experience heightened levels of energy, strength, instant reactions, and clear thinking. However, too much stress causes damage and dysfunction to our body, mind, and spirit. If our stress button is pressed frequently, our body is on almost continuous alert. When our body doesn't have a chance to rest and recover, we can suffer anxiety, depression and health problems. Study shows that constant triggering of our stress buttons can cause the following: [Source: The Impact of Stress, By Steve Bressert, Ph.D.; http://psychcentral.com/lib/2006/the-impact-of-stress/] Physical signs of stress include: "" sleep disturbance "" digestive upsets "" agitated behavior "" increased heart rate "" general restlessness "" muscle tension "" chest pains "" dizziness "" hyperventilating "" nervousness "" high blood pressure "" lack of energy "" fatigue Cognitive signs of stress include: "" mental slowness "" confusion "" negative attitudes or thoughts "" constant worry "" your mind races at times "" difficulty concentrating "" forgetfulness "" difficulty thinking in a logical sequence "" the sense that life is overwhelming; you can't problem-solve Emotional signs of stress include: "" irritation "" no sense of humor "" frustration "" feeling overworked "" feeling overwhelmed "" sense of helplessness "" apathy Behavioral signs of stress include: "" decreased contact with family and friends "" poor work relations "" sense of loneliness "" decreased sex drive "" avoiding others and others avoid you because you're cranky "" failing to set aside times for relaxation We need to learn how to experience rest.

Luke 22:31-34,"('Failure', 'Failure As Test', 'Restoration Of Peter')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," How to Fail Without Becoming a Failure Luke 22:31-22:34 Kurt Cobain. The famous rock singer-songwriter, musician, and best known as the lead singer and guitarist of the band Nirvana, has sold over 50 million albums worldwide. During the last years of his life, Cobain struggled with heroin addiction and depression. On April 8, 1994, Cobain was found dead at his home in Seattle, he committed suicide by a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head. Ernest Hemingway. The famous and best-selling writer, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature, was well known for his adventurous spirit and distinctive writing style. He ended his career as an alcoholic and He committed suicide at age 62. Adolf Merckle. German billionaire, one of top 100 richest people in world, commits suicide after he ran into deep financial trouble; he lost hundreds of millions of dollars with his companies amid the economic crisis. This morning I want to talk to you about how to fail without becoming a failure. What's the difference? Everybody fails. People fail in school. People fail at business. People fail in marriage, fail in parenting, fail in their careers....people fail the Lord. Everybody fails. The question is not 'how bad the failure is'... the question is ""how good the response to the failure is'... Big Idea: A person is not finished when he fails; a person is finished when he gives up. As hard as it is to admit, you and I and every one of us have all failed. But just because you fail doesn't mean you are a failure. There is a big difference. A really good example is the difference between two of Jesus' disciples: Simon Peter and Judas Iscariot. Both men failed Christ--Peter by denying his Lord, Judas by betraying his Lord. But Judas ends up a failure, drowning so deep in regret and despair he commits suicide. Peter, on the other hand, seems to get past his failure and becomes one of the most important leaders of the early church. What made the difference between failing and being a failure? I think you can get some clues from a conversation between Jesus and Simon Peter recorded in Luke 22:31-34. The words of Jesus are an encouragement to Peter---an encouragement for everybody who fails---about how to handle failure, to get past your failing to become the person God created you to be. Jesus' words to Peter give us 3 truths to encourage us when we fail: I. SATAN WANTS TO USE FAILURE TO DRAG YOU DOWN. (v. 31) Jesus' words are spoken after the Last Supper, after Judas has left to betray the Lord to his enemies. After the disciples have argued over who is the greatest in Christ's kingdom. Jesus' love for Peter overwhelms Him, and I believe it's with tears in His eyes He looks at Peter, and says Simon! Simon! Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat...! The ""you"" here is plural -- ""you all."" Jesus isn't just speaking to Peter--He's saying all of you will be sifted. Stop for a moment and ask yourself: What if Jesus looked at you with love in His heart and tears in His eyes and said those words to you?"
1 Timothy 4:12,"('Love', 'Leaders')",Church Of God," 1 Timothy 4:12 Let no one despise your youth, but be an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit,[b] in faith, in purity. --Go over what we have talked about the last few weeks-- *Word *Conduct/ Integrity *Tonight we are going to talk about Love * Introduction The Bible says we are to love one another. Sounds good, But can we do it? Someone once said, ""I love mankind; ----it's people I can't stand. People are hard to love sometimes right? Even people at church can be difficult to love. Sometimes it's hard enough to love our own family. Everyone knows what i am talking about there right ? Specially right after the holidays !!!! When all the family gets together you see just how hard it is to love some of them!! **One guy told his wife that if she had really loved him she would have married someone else. Its hard to love people sometimes right? So how do we make love a characteristic of our lives? I. Make love a priority We all agree loving people is difficult. But it is what the Bible commands. (1 John 3:11). ""For this is the message you have heard from the beginning: we should love one another"" 1 Corinthians 16:14 Let all that you do be done in love. Not some things you do ...Let all that you do All things you do.. That means when people are looking and when no one is looking. That means when everyone else is talking bad and making fun of someone you stand up for them.. That means don't just be nice to people why you are in here, but be nice to them when you leave here as well.. **Let all that you do be done in Love** *If you are going to be a leader you are going to have to realize that others are watching you They are watching how you talk They are watching how you conduct yourself And they are going to be watching and paying attention to see if you're acting out of love.. The Bible has a great deal to say about love. In fact, the Bible says in 1 John 4:7-8 that ""God is love"" In other words, love is a fundamental characteristic of who God is. Everything God does is impelled and influenced by His love. If you say that your a leader and want to be like Him Then ever thing you do should be out of love as well! The Bible uses several different words for ""love"" in the Hebrew and Greek, Some of these words mean (""affectionate love"") ; others indicate ""friendship""; and still others, ""erotic, sexual love."" The caring provision love of Boaz for Ruth; The deep friendship love of David and Jonathan; The fatherly love of Paul for Timothy and John for the church; And, of course, the sacrificial, saving love of Christ for the elect. The bible tells us a lot about love Especially in the ""love chapter,"" Who knows what the love chapter is ? 1 Corinthians 13. Love is patient and kind; love doesn't envy, boast, or dishonor others; love is not proud or self-seeking; love is not easily angered, doesn't keep a record of wrongs, and doesn't delight in evil; rather, love rejoices with the truth; love always protects, trusts, hopes, and perseveres; love never fails I want to point out two words from this passage"
1 Kings 19:9-21,"('Discipleship', 'Depression', 'Elisha', 'Calling')",Independent/Bible," Elisha the Disciple (I Kings 19:9-21) 1. A story is told that At the beginning of a new year, a high school principal decided to post his teachers' new year's resolutions on the bulletin board. As the teachers gathered around the bulletin board, a great commotion started. One of the teachers was complaining. ""Why weren't my resolutions posted?"" She was throwing such a temper tantrum that the principal hurried to his office to see if he had overlooked her resolutions. Sure enough, he had mislaid them on his desk. As he read her resolutions he was astounded. This teacher's first resolution was not to let little things upset her in the New Year. 2. Or how bout this one...A son called his parents to wish them a happy new year and when his Dad answered the phone, He asked his dad,"" well Dad, what's your new year's resolution? His dad replied, To make ""To make your mother as happy as I can all year,"" When his mom got on the phone he asked. her the same question. His mom replied my resolution is ""To see that your dad keeps his New Year's resolution."" [Kevin Litchfield, sermon central] 3. People like to make resolutions because they want to change things -- usually for the better. But change is difficult. Transitions can be challenging. 4. Today we are beginning a series about the prophet Elisha, who took the reigns from the prophet Elijah in about 860 BC. Northern Kingdom of Israel. Main Idea: Elisha would work more miracles and extend more grace than any other until Jesus. But he did not surface out of nowhere; let's begin his story at the beginning. I. Elijah Prepared the Way for ELISHA (9-18) Retell but do not read this section A. Elijah is to Elisha what John was to JESUS. Elisha and Yeshua have almost the same name, when it comes to meaning. B. Elijah went from EUPHORIA to DEPRESSION (9-13). 1. Elijah went to Saudi Arabia to Mt. Sinai in fear and depression 2. He had experienced a great victory -- a contest between Yahweh and Baal 3. Queen Jezebel (Ahab), a priestess of Baal... a marked man 4. He went from joy to despair... the bottom dropped out 5. God deals with him gently... "" What are you doing here, Elijah? "" I am alone for You "" Come out of the cave and stand before me! "" wind, "" earthquake, "" fire, "" whisper (yes) 6. Elijah grieves before God 7. What are you doing here, Elijah? "" ""I alone... "" destroyed altar Baal, "" after my life..."" C. God Gives Elijah Some TASKS (15-17) 1. Go to Damascus, Syria, and anoint Hazael to be king of Syria 2. Anoint Jehu to be king of Israel 3. Anoint Elisha to be a prophet who will replace you. D. God informs Elijah that 7,000 men have NOT bowed the knee to Baal (18) II. Elijah Called Elisha to Discipleship Like Jesus Called His DISCIPLES (19-21) Read this section "" The Rabbis used this as a model for the relationship of a disciple to a rabbi "" Many of Jesus' teachings and His approach come from these few verses A. Elisha was busy EARNING a living among ""the Twelve"" (19a,b). B. Elijah calls Elisha to ministry by passing on his CLOAK (19c). C. Elisha leaves mother and father and IMMEDIATELY follows him (20)."
Ephesians 1:15-23,"('Wealth', 'Riches', 'Success In Life', 'Rich In Faith')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Traits of the Truly Rich Ephesians 1:15-23 Lady Diana. Married into the Royal Family of England, wife of Prince Charles, the very beautiful Diana had all that anybody could ever dream of. She had two most beautiful children in the world. One would wonder, what more did she want in life? But, no, she was not happy. She did have bouts of depression. Tiger Woods. A famous professional golf player, who has over one billion dollars. He is linked to many sex scandals, dragging his marriage into a tough divorce. His sex addiction is causing him to spend thousands of dollars on women to have group sex. He has been getting treatment for his sex addiction. Tiger has a list of 20 ladies in his scandalous life. Richard Lang. A Lottery winner who won nearly $ 2 million five years ago hanged himself at his luxury four-bedroom home. After winning the lottery in 2005, Richard Lang, 31, went on expensive holidays and bought expensive cars. But friends and family were left shocked when he was found dead at his $ 800,000 house. What is true wealth? Is it having more money? Is it having multiple residences? Is it being able to take a 2 month vacation whenever you want to, and wherever you want to go? Is it having the most expensive car? Title: Traits of the Truly Rich (Ephesians 1:15-23) This morning we will try to understand what it means to be truly wealthy. We will try to look at what makes a person wealthy... True richness is not really all about what you have... but it is really all about who you are. It is not so much about what life brings to you... but it is really all about what you bring into life. Big Idea: Knowing Your Wealth in Christ Enables You to Walk for Christ. Suggested Outline of Ephesians I. Doctrine: The Believer's Blessings in Christ (1-3) II. Duty: The Believer's Behavior in Christ (4-6) Ephesians balances doctrine and duty. First Paul reminds us of what God has done for us; then he tells us what we must do for Him in response to His mercies. Christian living is based on Christian learning. The believer who does not know his wealth in Christ will never be able to walk for Christ. Our conduct depends on our calling. Too many Christians live in chapters 1-3 and study the doctrines but fail to move into chapters 4-6 and practice the duties. Ephesus was one of the great cities of Asia Minor: a Roman capital, a center for the worship of Diana, and a wealthy commercial center, located on an ample harbor that invited world trade. The temple of Diana was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, and the worship of this goddess was jealously guarded (see Acts 19:23ff). There are two prayers in Ephesians: (1) ""that you might know,"" 1:15-23; and (2) ""that you might be,"" 3:13-21. The first is for enlightenment, the second for enablement. Paul prays first that we might know what Christ has done for us; then he prays that we might live up to these wonderful blessings and put them to work in our daily lives. (Wiersbe's Expository Outlines on the New Testament) Eph 1:3 TLB How we praise God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every blessing in heaven because we belong to Christ."
Matthew 3:13-17,"('Water', 'Come')",United Methodist," Come to The Waters Matthew 3:13-17 1. Consider the Value of Water Water is the most valuable resource on the planet. All living things -- fish, animals, plants and humans -- need water to survive Jesus journeys from Galilee to the Jordan Waters 1. It is in the waters of the Jordan Jesus desires to be baptized 2. Jesus desires not only to be baptized in the Jordan but desires to be baptized by John 3. John tried to detour Jesus from being baptized by him, instead John felt that Jesus should baptize him Jesus tells John this is the proper thing for you to do to fulfill all righteousness 4. As soon as Jesus comes up out of the water Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. Then a voice from heaven said, ""This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased ."" ... 2. There is images of Water in the beginning of the bible in the book of Genesis waters covered the face of the earth water ends in Revelation with a vision of a river that flows from the throne of God. "" Even Our ancestors understood the value of water for both our physical and spiritual lives. "" Water In the Exodus story, brings the Hebrews a great deliverer Moses floating down a river as a baby, "" The Waters of the Red Sea are divided providing a road of escape then the same waters destroy the foe "" The waters flow from a rock once Moses takes the staff and hits the rock in the desert supplying the people with refreshing waters because they are dry and thirsty. "" Joshua leads the children of Israel across the Jordan waters which allowed them to cross over into a land of great promise the promised land, Beulah land , the land that flows with milk and honey 3. Water is associated with much of the life of Jesus himself. "" Jesus and his disciples, several of whom were fishermen, also spent a good bit of their time around water. "" Jesus walked on water, calmed a storm while they were on a boat on the Sea of Galilee "" Jesus talked about living water with a woman who had come to a well to get water for her house. 4. Water is symbolically related to cleaning of sins, Washing away our sins, offering us salvation, 1. The faithful enter the waters aware of their separation from the holiness of God due to the sin in their lives, and emerge renewed, refreshed and spiritually clean. 2. The water serves as a reminder of how God is always ready to forgive when we repent 5. The purpose of the waters for baptism "" Waters of baptism is a sign of death to our old lives and resurrection into new lives in Christ. "" In the waters of baptism we celebrate the grace of God as we are born a new and receive forgiveness. "" In the waters of baptism, we remember we are the children of God, loved by God and pleasing to God. "" In the waters of baptism we encounter affirmation as did Jesus in the Jordan the Spirit of God fell upon Jesus and God said, ""This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."" God is just as proud of us 6. The waters of baptism is an unending supply so ""Come to The Waters"""
Philippians 4:4-9,"('Peace', 'Spiritual Warfare', 'Prayer', 'Battle For The Mind')",Baptist," Preparing our Heart and Mind (Part 2) Philippians 4: 4-9 We began to consider these powerful verses in our last study, and I hope to conclude them today. Paul was well aware of the various struggles the church faced. Society presented particular challenges and there were disagreements and struggles within the church itself. However, Paul knew one of the greatest battles any believer would face was within his or her own heart and mind. For the church to be victorious in Christ, believers need to be aware of the tactics of the enemy and prepared to face his attacks. I am sure you will agree that many of the battles we face regarding our spiritual walk with the Lord originate in the mind. We too must prepare for the battle, guarding our heart and mind from attack. I want to resume our look at the challenges Paul offered as we consider: Preparing our Heart and Mind. Quickly, let's review our last study. We discovered: I. An Appeal to Rejoice (4) A. The Admonition - This was not a mere suggestion. B. The Expectation - Rejoice in the Lord always...and again I say, Rejoice! II. An Appeal to Remain (5-7) A. Resilient (5) - Remaining humble and gracious in difficulty; resilient in faith. B. Confident (6a) - Not irresponsibly, but without anxiety and worry. C. Dependent (6b) - but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. Paul was well aware of his dependence on the Lord for every area of life, especially when facing attack from the enemy. In order to overcome, he knew he must remain in constant communication with the Lord through prayer, being totally dependent upon Him to provide strength and wisdom to overcome. I know this seems elementary for those who have walked with the Lord for years, but it is impossible to overemphasize the importance of prayer. We are no match for the enemy within our own strength and wisdom. If we are to guard our hearts and minds, being prepared to face the attacks of the enemy, we must be committed to diligence in prayer. We must take our needs to the Lord while depending solely upon Him to provide and equip us for battle. A hurried look at this verse would miss its great importance. Paul actually provides a detailed look at the various types of prayer we must offer unto the Lord. In fact, each of these aspects should be present each time we pray. He speaks of: Prayer - This speaks of a special time of worship and devotion unto the Lord. We should never approach the throne of grace apart from a time of worship and devotion for the Lord, in recognition of His sovereign power and grace. Supplication - This refers to our focus upon a special or particular need. It involves coming before the Lord and pouring our heart out before Him, declaring our need and pleading with Him to intervene on our behalf. Thanksgiving - This is an offering of praise and thanksgiving unto the Lord for His great provision in our lives and the grace He daily bestows."
Psalms 33:12,"('America', 'Godly', 'Great', 'Trump')",Baptist," Make America Godly Again Ps. 33:12-22 Get all resources for this sermon at: http://www.gracenotessermons.com/sermons/make-america-godly-again/ Our text begins: ""Blessed is the nation whose..."" And how does it continue? ""...whose president is Trump""? Whose stocks are on the rise? / whose healthcare law is repealed? / whose factories move back from Mexico? / whose border wall is built? / whose friend is Putin? [see Ezek. 38-39 for the end times role of Russia, AKA Gog and Magog] No. ""...whose God is the Lord""! v. 22 ends ""we hope in thee"" It is vain to trust in kings [Psalm 146:3] Yes, it is vain to trust in men... ...especially prideful ones with no record of righteousness and with personal morals only rivaled by Bill Clinton. Now, I am thankful for the election...in the sense of who lost. No good was going to come from a Hillary administration. But I am not at all ready to go out on a limb and say that the nation won. I mean, what is this guy - a consolation prize? I like where he currently stands on many issues ... but I say 'currently' since he hasn't stood there long, and I'm not sure how resolutely he stands at all. If we truly want to be great again, we must seek to be Godly again! I truly hope that the nation wins. I hope the unborn truly win. I hope for prosperity. I am trying to be optimistic...but I must be realistic. And as I see conservative America begin to 'hero worship' a 'king-like' man and put their trust in him I shudder in fear. I am one of those who voted for the Vice President. I literally said to the lady at the ballot box, ""I am voting for Vice President only. Do I have to take his running mate?"" She knew exactly what I meant, though she couldn't let on. I believe in voting for principles, for morality, and righteousness which exalts a nation. We should vote for principle over pocketbook. Is it wrong to want to be prosperous, and to strive to expand and upgrade business? No, but the Scriptures are very clear that it is God who brings the increase, not politicians. During the Clinton years all America cared about was Dow Jones, when we should have cared about 'Paula Jones'. Have we come full circle? Will you really rejoice as long as you prosper, even if your leaders have the morals of alley cats? I am hopeful for America to be great again...and it will only happen if America becomes Godly again. Let's begin with the positive...and there's much to be positive about: With all her faults, America is still the greatest place on Earth to live! 1. Her Greatness "" Great for her beauty But that's not what makes her great. Beauty can be deceitful, and ugly can go all the way to the bone. Outwardly the new world hosts the prettiest places on the planet. But what is true greatness? "" Great for her freedoms The United States of America is over 240 years old. That's young in a historical perspective, but it's a long time for a nation to remain free. Really, when you look at our history in the context of world history America is just a CHILD among the nations. Egypt, China, Japan, Rome, Greece all make America's history seem so short. Consider what a brief time we've really been here as a nation: When Thomas Jefferson died, Abraham Lincoln was a young man of 17. When Lincoln was assassinated, Woodrow Wilson was a boy of 8. By the time he died Ronald Reagan was a boy of 12. And when Reagan was in office, our most recent President was still eating dogs in Kenya! Thomasine Mcneill commented on Jan 11, 2017 By the time he died Ronald Reagan was a boy of 12. And when Reagan was in office, our most recent President was still eating dogs in Kenya! ....  I was appalled by your use of ""our most recent President was still eating dogs in Kenya"" in your analogy.

 Dearl Hardy commented on Feb 3, 2017 This is probably something you should take up with Obama since he wrote it in his autobiography, I hardly see where Pastor Shirley has done anything wrong by quoting his book with a factual statement. Maybe you are creating your own judgmental reaction because you have your own problem that you are projecting onto Pastor Shirley.Maybe you should pray about what is really the root of your issue. 
Very nice sermon as always Pastor Shirley thank you for keeping it honest and godly as you always do. you help so many of us in our sermon preps. God bless Oh and by the way as i responded I assumed you and eddie mcgriff listed below are the same ones that instantly pop up online as both being affiliated deeply within the democratic party, among other things it shows online. Maybe that influences your feelings on his sermon for the wrong reasons. God bless You are in my prayers.  love in Christ Rick Sutton commented on Jan 13, 2017 Why were you appalled when this is what he wrote in his own autobiography?  Eddie Mcgriff commented on Jan 27, 2017 we are appalled because he said nothing of the kind when referencing the other presidents, but drew from what could be twisted to mean our former president practice some primitive in his book president Obama talked about things he was exposed too and did with the other children, servants, and low-level bureaucrats, and friends, such as catching crickets, flying kites, eating small green chili pepperss raw, and away from the dinner table they were introduced dog meat [though tough], snake meat, roasted grasshoppers [crunchy]. he alos mentioned the people believed that people believed in ancient customs people took on the power of what they ate, there even the promise from someone to bring home tiger meat; so it just seems suspicious that you would only draw on that excerpt when mentioning president Obama but didnt mention any other childhood behaviors of the other men.

Revelation 4:1-11,"('Heaven', 'Twenty-Four Elders', 'Sea Of Glass')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 7-13-15 Title: God on the Throne (Revelation 4:1-11) Revelation 4:1-11 (KJV) 1 After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter. 2 And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne. 3 And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald. 4 And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold. 5 And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. 6 And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind. 7 And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle. 8 And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come. The phrase ""which was, and is, and his to come"" describes God's transcendence over time--he is eternal (1:4). 9 And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, 10 The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, 11 Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created. Introduction At this point we should be reminded of the three fold division of the book as it appears in 1:19: ""Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter"" (KJV). ""The things which thou hast seen""--the vision of the glorified Christ in chapter 1. ""The things which are""--the history of the Church on earth prewritten from Pentecost to the Rapture as seen in the letters to the seven churches in chapters 2 and 3. ""The things which shall be hereafter""--the future events to take place after the true Church has been taken out of the earth as recorded in chapters 4 through 22. In chapters 2 and 3 we saw the Risen Christ walking amidst His churches upon earth. Now the scene changes to the courts of heaven. With this passage, John's writing transition's from the letters to the churches to the vision of heaven. He begins with a vision of God Himself. From 4:1 to the end of the book all the events follow the rapture of the Church. By this time God will have completed His Church and the Church will have completed her mission on earth. In fact, the word ""church"" does not appear again in the book until the end, where the glorified Lord speaks to the churches (22:16). We are now living somewhere toward the close of the second period designated by the phrase, ""the things which are,"" awaiting our Lord's coming to rapture the Church to Himself. Thus we are about to view the thrilling panorama of wonders which are to take place after the church's mission on earth has ended and she is caught up to being with Christ, ""things which must be hereafter."" If we miss this divine division of the book we have lost the key to its understanding."
John 1:29-42,"('Son Of God', 'Holy Spirit Baptism', 'Jesus Lamb Of God', ""Disciples' Role"")",*other,ohn 1:29-," Title: What is Our Role? Proposition: In this passage John the Evangelist reveals to us our role - TO BE A WITNESS. To tell others 1. Jesus came to take away sin 2. Jesus is the Only Son of God 3. Jesus will baptize us in the Holy Spirit INTRO: Grace and peace from God our Father and from Jesus Christ who came to take away the sin of the world! Several years ago, I had the privilege of working with a couple of High School Basketball coaches. One of them was coaching the boy's team while the other was coaching the girl's team. It was amazing how much I was able to learn from these two individuals. They taught me about the fundamentals of basketball along with some ways that a team could improve both their offense and defense. They also taught me that each player on a team has a specific role to play. You see, recently, I had noticed that there was this one player that never seemed to shoot the ball during a game. They would dribble the ball up the court, they would pass, they would rebound and they would play defense but very rarely would they ever take a shot. About the only time they would shoot was when they were shooting a layup or when they were about 5 feet from the goal with no one around. So, one day while I was working with the coach I ask him why this particular player wouldn't shoot. He looked at me and told me that this young man better not shoot. Shooting wasn't his role. His role was to guard, to bring the ball down the court, to pass and when possible to rebound. The team had no specific plays designed for that particular player to shoot the ball. That made me even more curious so I asked why shooting wasn't a part of his role on the team. The coach's answer was quick and straight - ""He can't shoot"". The young man was excellent at dribbling, rebounding, passing and defending but he was a terrible shot. No matter how much the young man practiced his shot the reality was he was a terrible shooter. So, the coach gave him a specific role. He could dribble, pass, rebound and defend but when it came to shooting it better be either a layup or a shot so close with no one around that he could rebound his own miss. Since then I have found out that in almost every sport players have certain roles that they are suppose to play. If you are on a football team and you are a running back, wide receiver or an offensive guard there is a specific role you are suppose to play. You can get into a lot of trouble not playing your role. You can get a penalty, lose the ball or make your coach very angry which I have a feeling is the worst thing you can do. I knew that in music and drama every person has a particular role to play. In music each instrument has a certain role to play to help create the wonderful of music. In drama each person has a certain role to play. Each role has certain words to memorize and certain actions to display. For example, if you have a lead role then you must play like a lead role. If you have a supporting role you are to support the lead actors and not put yourself into the lime light."
Jeremiah 18:1,"('New Beginning', 'Start Over', 'God Of New Beginnings')",Church Of God," The God of new beginnings JEREMIAH 18:1-6 THE WORD which came to Jeremiah from the Lord: Arise and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause you to hear My words. Then I went down to the potter's house, and behold, he was working at the wheel. And the vessel that he was making from clay was spoiled in the hand of the potter; so he made it over, reworking it into another vessel as it seemed good to the potter to make it. Then the word of the Lord came to me: O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter does? says the Lord. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are you in My hand, O house of Israel. Many of us here today and many people you know are looking for, or need another chance, and a new beginning. Well I have good news for you today Our God is the God of another chance, And He is the God of new beginnings. Have any of you ever wished you could go back and start over? Maybe it's because of an unpleasant situation in your past. If only you could go back!! you would make different choices. IF you could only take the words back that you said. Sadly it is impossible to go back and change what has been said or done. But there is however one area of your life that you can have a new beginning:? This area I am talking about is Your spiritual life. If you allow God to take complete control He can give you a fresh new start! So today. I want you to think for one second What is my need? What do i need from The Lord today? Is it a new outlook on life? Is it SALVATION? Maybe there are some areas in your life that needs SANCTIFICATION. Or maybe you just need to be more Committed? Maybe you want to get rid of some bad habits. Whatever it is that you need know that God Specializes in new beginnings! Amen In the stricture we just read God used a unique manner to teach Jeremiah a valuable lesson. At this time Jeremiah is very discouraged and about to give up on God's people. He seemed to think, that God had done all He could, and now there was no hope. There is no way God could turn around this situation. All hope is lost!?Have you even been there? Have you ever thought you have done all that you can do, and just about to give up, then God showed up and turned it around? Have you ever had God speak to you.?Have you ever hade God send someone to you, to give you a on time word??Maybe he had some one send you a text message! Maybe it was though a phone call, or maybe some one just stopped by your work one day to encourage you. You see it was a on time word God gave Jeremiah, He told him to go down to the pottery. And when Jeremiah got were God told him to be, that's when he saw a potter at the wheel shaping a vessel. The potter's foot was on the pedal moving the wheel around and around as the potter shaped the vessel. But just as the vessel seemed to be taking shape, and becoming compleat, something happened: the vessel was spoiled. Now Jeremiah probably thought the potter would reject the spoiled clay as if the material was now of no value. But Instead the potter flatten it again, put it back on the wheel, and caused it to take shape once more."

C. THESIS 1. The beginning of a new year is a wonderful thing. It affords us new beginnings, new hopes, and new dreams. We can't change the past, but 2017 holds out the possibility of a whole new life. Will we seize the opportunity? 2. The title of this message is ""Made New."" We're looking at the 3 things NEW about Christians since they're new creatures: I. NEW IN INNOCENCE A. IS INNOCENCE POSSIBLE? 1. DEFINITION: 1 a : freedom from guilt or sin through being unacquainted with evil : blamelessness b : chastity c : freedom from legal guilt of a particular crime or offense d (1) : freedom from guile or cunning : simplicity (2) : lack of worldly experience or sophistication [Merriam-Webster]. 2. Despite us having lived ungodly lives prior to our salvation, we can get our innocence back after getting saved. In fact, getting your innocence back is one of the marks of a Child of God! Listen to what Jesus says: 3. ""And he said: 'Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.'"" Matt. 18:3. Two key factors about children are their innocence and their trust. How is renewed innocence possible? Because the old sinful self died with Christ and the New Creation being has never sinned! Gal. 2:20. 4. 2 Cor. 5:17; ""Therefore if any man (person) be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."" 5. God says He'll give us a new heart (Eze. 36:26) and a new spirit (Eze. 11:19), make us a new creature (2 Cor.5:17) with a new name (Isa. 62:2; Rev. 2:17), and put a new song ((Ps. 40:3) and a new tongue in our mouths (Mk. 16:17). Then He'll help us walk in newness of life (Rom. 6:14) by a new commandment (Jn. 13:34) into the new heavens and new earth (2 Pet. 3:3) where we'll get to enter His holy city New Jerusalem (Rev. 3:12). That's a lot of new! B. TWO KEY STAGES 1. FORGIVENESS & CLEANSING. The blood of Jesus is said to be ""innocent blood"" Mt. 27:4. His blood justifies us (Rom. 5:9), redeems us (Eph. 1:7), brings us near (Eph. 2:13), makes peace with God (Col. 1:20), cleanses our consciences (Heb. 9:14), sanctifies us (Heb. 13:12), cleanses us from all sin (1 Jn. 1:7), & washes us (Rev. 1:5). 2. ""But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin. If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness."" 1 Jn. 1:7-9."
Luke 2:21-38,"('Religious', 'Spiritual Discipline', 'Spiritual Disciplines')",Lutheran," Luke 2:21-38. ""Fulfillment of a Promise"" INTRODUCTION During the Advent and Christmas Seasons, we have had many messengers and models to encourage and direct us on our walk of faith. The prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel spoke to us in the Hebrew Scriptures. We have also heard from two angels, Mary, Joseph, and the shepherds. Today we see Mary and Joseph again, for a couple of verses and then meet two aged sages, Simeon and Anna. By their examples, these four Biblical characters proclaim the gospel message and share with a us simple but profound lesson on nurturing our faith and our relationship with God. THE TEMPLE The location of the first scene in the story of Jesus' birth was a stable. The second scene is located in the temple. In verse 21, Mary and Joseph bring Jesus to the temple in order to have him circumcised. Later (in verse 22 ff) they bring Jesus to the temple to be redeemed. The redemption was an offering given because Jesus was Mary and Joseph's first born son, who was automatically dedicated to the Lord. The couple also came to the temple to offer a sacrifice for Mary's purification. This was an offering that was required thirty days after the birth of a child. In one sense these are rather mundane scenes. There are no angels nor stars, at this time. Yet, these few verses do allow us to glimpse at the depth of Mary and Joseph's faith. They were deeply involved in the religious life and rituals of their Jewish faith. They brought Jesus up in the context of the temple and synagogues. Worship, sacrifice, prayer, study, discussion and fellowship were all a part of Jesus' life. These factors shaped him and molded Jesus' relationship with God. We could presume that the religious practices of Mary and Joseph really didn't matter. Jesus would have been God's Son and the Messiah without their influence. Still, I believe that it was important for Jesus to be raised in a family of faith. These verses underscore how important our congregation and the fellowship of believers is for raising our children in the faith and for our own personal journeys of faith. SIMEON AND ANNA We first meet Simeon, who is described as a man who was righteous and devout, looking forward to the consolation of Israel. Later we meet Anna who is a prophet of great age who never left the temple but worshiped there with fasting and prayer night and day. Today we place a great deal of importance in living out our faith. It isn't enough to believe in a certain set of religious principles and theological doctrines. We need to follow Jesus' command to ""Love one another, as he loved us."" We need to serve. Simeon and Anna deliver a different, but important, message to us. Simeon was devout and righteous. His righteousness addressed his relationship with God and with the people around him. Simeon was in a right relationship with them. He was also devout. This means that he was active in worship and sacrifice, prayer and study. The hallmarks of Anna's life were also described as worship, prayer and fasting. The practice of using the Spiritual Disciplines were a part of the lives of these two people and are portrayed as notable and important."
Luke 3:1-22,"('Holy Spirit', 'Incarceration')",Lutheran," Introduction God and Suffering is one of the greatest conundrums that people of faith face. Where is God in pain, persecution and loss? The length of suffering increases the questions. It is one thing to struggle with God's presence when one is turned down for a job promotion, or has gall bladder surgery. It is something else to discern God's movement when pain continues for years, persecution is beyond our escape, or the sickness is incurable. During the past several days, I have become aware, or I have been reminded of several people--family, friends, and parishioners--who have experienced immense suffering over an extended period of time. I have been at a loss as to what to say to them. Offering to keep them in prayer seems so inadequate. The stories of John the Baptist and the Baptism of Jesus speak to our human condition. Whether we have experienced a lifetime of pain, or struggle with a disappointing loss or failure, these stories share the good news of God's love and grace with us. God's Involvement As we enter the story, our attention is drawn to historical markers. The New Revised Standard Version The Proclamation of John the Baptist In the fifteenth year of the reign of Emperor Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was ruler of Galilee, and his brother Philip ruler of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias ruler of Abilene, 2 during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, God enters human history. We have just celebrated God's incarnation--God becoming human--in the birth of Jesus, the Christ Child. God does not limit God's involvement to one person. Rather, God is involved in a multitude of people and in a number of ways. God is present. This truth is accentuated in Luke's quote from Isaiah 40 ... The voice of one crying out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. 5 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways made smooth; 6 and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.' "" This passage was addressed to the Jewish Exiles, who were living in Babylon in the sixth century BCE. It was a message meant to give them hope as they endured decades of hardships, poverty and persecution. God was coming to them. God was involving himself in their lives. In the middle of suffering, we are able to say something more than, ""I'll pray for you."" We can assert that God is present. God has not abandoned God's people. God ""has not left the building."" In the Meantime .... The question we face is now changed. We no longer need to ask, ""Where is God in my suffering?"" We know that God is with us in the midst of our pain and despair. We now are faced with the question, ""How are we to live with our pain?"" John would first encourage us to turn our attention away from our pain (as much as we can) and turn toward God. Living in a relationship with God we can walk in a newness of life that comes with God's love, forgiveness, mercy and grace."
Isaiah 61:1-11,"('Endurance', 'Suffering')",Lutheran," Introduction As we prepare for the future--for the birth of the Christ Child and the arrival of the King of kings--we once again glance to the past. Today's text directs our attention to the exiles. The Exodus out of slavery in Egypt through the wilderness to the Promised Land and the Exile to Babylon consume a significant portion of the Old Testament. There are several reasons for this. First they are major events in the history of Israel. They are also very reflective of our individual and corporate lives. The Mess of Life Often life is neither pretty nor easy. It can get to be awfully messy. That was the situation of the Exiles. In this passage of scripture, they are addressed as the oppressed, the brokenhearted, captives, prisoners and people who mourn. The New Revised Standard Version The Good News of Deliverance The spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD has anointed me; he has sent me to bring good news to the oppressed, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and release to the prisoners; We can identify with the Exiles. There are times we feel oppressed by the expectation of others; brokenhearted because of loved ones who can no longer celebrate this Christmas season with us; captive to credit card debit and prisoner to over scheduled calendars. "" There are times when our lives are cluttered "" At other times our lives are a mess, and "" Occasionally our lives are disasters. The Lord did not abandon God's people during their exile nor does God abandon us in the messiness of life. Into those situations God speaks a word of hope. Hear the Word of the Lord God speaks good news to the oppressed. I have a friend who has been suffering from severe, debilitating headaches for over eight years. Modern medicine has only been able to provide him with mild, temporary relief. As he struggles to face days filled with pain, God's good news comes to him and that good news is that God loves him deeply and God will not abandon him. The husband of another good friend of mine died two years ago on December 22nd. Now the days before Christmas are filled with sadness for her and she is brokenhearted. Still she has heard the word of the Lord. She rejoices in the hope of the resurrection and family and friends surround her with love and the strength and comfort that a community can provide. I know a young man who is held captive by hatred and is oppressed by anger. There are many people like him. There are times when God's love, acceptance, forgiveness and grace break into his life and he is set free. This is an ongoing struggle, though. His hate and anger are strong and he occasionally returns to his cell. He is not abandoned, though and God's love is a constant. Thousands of people have faced tragedies during 2016. Recently there have been disastrous wildfires. Earlier in the year there were hurricanes, floods and tornadoes. Now there are destructive blizzards. In the midst of devastation, upheaval and loss God is present in words and in actions. God's presence is experienced and God's love is demonstrated."
Psalms 37:4,"('Church', 'The Road Ahead', 'Log In Your Eye', ""Heart's Desire"", 'Church Closing')",Foursquare," The first time God spoke to me was over twenty years ago. I was traveling down Highway 16 and was almost at Jones' Exxon when He said, ""Look in the book of Acts."" I hadn't been a Christian very long. Knew very little about the Bible. But I knew that a strong compulsion was upon me to look in the book of Acts. So I arrived at the house, went inside, grabbed my Bible, told my wife what I had heard, and began flipping through the pages. Suddenly, I heard ""Stop."" I was taken to this passage. Acts 5: 33 - 39 ""When they heard this, the high council was furious and decided to kill them. But one member, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, who was an expert in religious law and respected by all the people, stood up and ordered that the men be sent outside the council chamber for a while. Then he said to his colleagues, 'Men of Israel, take care what you are planning to do to these men! Some time ago there was that fellow Theudas, who pretended to be someone great. About 400 others joined him, but he was killed, and all his followers went their various ways. The whole movement came to nothing. After him, at the time of the census, there was Judas of Galilee. He got people to follow him, but he was killed, too, and all his followers were scattered. So my advice is, leave these men alone. Let them go. If they are planning and doing these things merely on their own, it will soon be overthrown. But if it is from God, you will not be able to overthrow them. You may even find yourselves fighting against God!'"" God then spoke to me and said, ""Read this from the pulpit."" Now you need a little background information. At the time, I was attending a church of around 300 people. I was the new kid on the block since we had not been going there very long. In fact, we got there shortly before the new pastor that ruffled some old feathers and there was a huge movement to boot him out. Business meetings had gotten unruly and a couple of times it spilled into services. In fact, the Sunday before this word came to me, we went straight from the sermon into a business meeting and all the guest were asked to leave. So here I sat wondering what was I to do. I called the pastor and told him that God had given me a passage to read. I may have even told him what it was. He said that he needed to get the approval of the deacons so I figured that was the end of that. However, he called back and said they had okayed it. Suddenly I am immersed in scripture that I had never seen before. Exodus 32:9 And the Lord said to Moses, ""I have seen this people, and indeed it is a stiff-necked people! and Ezekiel 34 1-4 ""Then this message came to me from the Lord: 'Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds, the leaders of Israel. Give them this message from the Sovereign Lord: What sorrow awaits you shepherds who feed yourselves instead of your flocks. Shouldn't shepherds feed their sheep? You drink the milk, wear the wool, and butcher the best animals, but you let your flocks starve. You have not taken care of the weak. You have not tended the sick or bound up the injured. You have not gone looking for those who have wandered away and are lost. Instead, you have ruled them with harshness and cruelty."""
Psalms 34:1,"('Praise',)",Assembly Of God," TITLE: ""A Blessing At All Times"" TEXT: Psalm 34:1 (KJV) INTRODUCTION: In this Psalm, David pours his heart out in thanks to God for His protection and deliverance. This psalm is known as an ""acoustic psalm"" which means each step in the psalm follows a progressive letter of the Hebrew alphabet. It is detailed and intentional instruction to the children of Israel. He gives some hints (life principles/secrets) on how to be a blessing (to God and others) at all times. Upon seeing verse 1 in the Authorized King James Verson, I noticed that the last part of the verse reveals three distinct parts of this secret (clearly seen by simple observing the italicized, or translator-added text). 1. HIS PRAISE a. Praise belongs to God. 1) It is His! 2) He is the ORIGIN of our praise. 3) He is the OWNER of our praise. b. Praise lifts us from our realm to His presence. 1) It gets our eyes off our problems (John 3:30) 2) It focuses our faith on His promises. 2. MY MOUTH a. Our mouths are very powerful weapons in the spiritual arena. 1) Life and death (Prov. 18:21; Deut. 30:19) 2) Faith and Confession (Ps. 116:10; 2 Cor. 4:13) b. There is a discipline to praising God. We must decide if we will follow God and engage our mouths in praiseworthy things. 1) There may even be times that we don't know how to praise God. There may be times we feel we are not even worthy to praise Him. 2) That's when we have to borrow some from God...since He owns it anyway! 3. CONTINUALLY a. When should we praise God? There are two times when we should praise the Lord: 1) When we feel like it... 2) And, when we don't feel like it... b. How should we praise God? 1) It's easy to praise God when you feel like it. There is little, or no sacrifice in that. 2) It's not so easy to praise God when you don't feel like it! That is when our praise becomes a sacrifice (ref. Hebrews 13:15). 3) However, when we don't feel like it is when we need it the most. CONCLUSION: Is it possible to be a blessing for God all the time? Let's rephrase the question. How can we bless the Lord at all times? Three little secrets are: His praise...My mouth...Continually!"
Matthew 1:18-25,"('Emmanuel', 'Messiah', 'Jesus', 'Incarnation')",Nazarene," Scripture Reading: Matthew 1:18-25 (Please open your Bibles to this text) When a man fathers a child and then leaves he abandons his child. The father might live in the same town as the child but if he only ever observes the child then he is a biological father but not a father in the true sense of the word. Fathers are supposed to love their children, provide for their children, teach their children, guide their children, discipline their children; that's what fathers do! If God the Father had created us and then just sat back to see how we would do He would indeed be a mighty God but He would not be a loving God. He would not be a loving Father. However, God the Father is the best example of a father caring for His children, His creation. That's us! Because God did NOT create the world and just sit back to watch what would happen. We can see the Lord interacting with humanity throughout the entire Bible. We see Him interacting through the prophets and priests and through direct intervention on behalf of His children. The Lord was, is and always will be a loving, providing, teaching, guiding, disciplining God and those of us who belong to Him know this to be true. And, here at Christmas, we see the God the Father sending His One and Only Son. This is the greatest act of Fatherhood ever; the sending of the Messiah, Emmanuel, God with us! So, let's go ahead and read the Scripture for this morning. Matthew 1:18-25 (At this time briefly explain the following) Verse 18 - The relationship between Joseph and Mary in that culture Pregnant through the Holy Spirit (Suggest that they read Luke 1) What could have happened to Mary Why Joseph was required to break the betrothal if Mary had indeed been promiscuous. Joseph did not hesitate to obey what the angel of the Lord had instructed him to do By obeying the instructions from the angel to marry Mary immediately he was opening himself up to suspicion and ridicule In spite of this he did the honorable thing and preserved Mary's purity until after Jesus had been born. Emmanuel - God with us Jesus - the Greek version of Joshua meaning ""the LORD saves"" Messiah (Hebrew) / Christ (Greek) - Anointed One But, let's think about Emmanuel, God with us. What a wonderful thing! As we think about Emmanuel, God with us and try to comprehend the immensity of this act of God let's take a look at a comparison in another religion. This other religion is the Mormon religion and their beliefs about Jesus are totally different from what the Bible teaches. Let me try to explain this: We believe that God the Father, sent God the Son, a person of the Triune Godhead to earth for the purpose of reconciling spiritually lost humanity to Himself. God the Son came from heaven, was born as a human in an event we call the Incarnation, lived a sinless life, voluntarily put Himself into the position of being tortured and crucified for our sins, was resurrected from the dead and has returned to God the Father."
Matthew 25:31-46,"('Assurance Of Salvation', 'The Return Of Jesus', 'Saved By Faith', 'Not Saved By Works')",Nazarene," Scripture Reading: Matthew 25:31-46 (Please open your Bibles to this text) The three most important questions ... 1) Can you believe it is 2017? (Are you ready for Y2K yet???) 2) Will Jesus return in 2017? 3) If Jesus does return will you be ready? Let's go ahead and read the Scripture for today from God's Holy Word. First of all we see in verse 31 that Jesus WILL return! OK. So we should already know the answer to the first question, which is, ""Can you believe that it is already 2017?"". So, what about the second question, ""Will Jesus return in 2017?"". One thing that we do know is that Jesus WILL return ... Jesus, Himself said in: Matthew 25:31 NIV ""When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, He will sit on His glorious throne."" Jesus WILL return ... In all of Matthew chapter 24 and 25 and in many other Holy Scriptures we see that Jesus WILL return and that no one know when His return will be. If someone tells you that they DO know when Jesus will return then know that they are not from whom you should be taking spiritual teaching. In Jesus' teaching in Matthew 24 He says: Matthew 24:36 NIV ""But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man."" Matthew 24:42 NIV ""Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come."" Matthew 25:5-6 NIV ""The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep. At midnight the cry rang out: 'Here's the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!'"" Matthew 25:19 NIV ""After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them."" So, we know the answer to the first half of the second question is, yes, Jesus will return but we have no idea if it will happen in 2017. Jesus could very well return this year! So, what about the third question, which is, ""If He does return, are YOU ready?"" Some folks believe that no one can REALLY know if they are going to heaven or not. Can anyone really know for sure??? What does our memory refresher Scripture for today say? 2 Timothy 3:16-17 ""All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work."" All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching so let's let Scriptures teach us and let's let Scriptures rebuke us and correct us if we need to be rebuked or corrected. OK? Let's look again at our Scripture for today ... In Matthew 25:36-40 we see that those who did certain things were blessed and entered into the Kingdom of God prepared since the creation of the world."
Exodus 12:50-13:16,"('Exodus', 'Sanctification', 'Set Apart', 'Sanctified')",*other," I. Introduction What a great way to start off our new year! As we set off into a new year it is always good to stop and reflect on what God has provided for us, and to renew our commitment to Him as Lord of our lives. This morning, as we prepare to look at this text, lets first do a bit of review: God has faithfully executed His redemptive plan to deliver His people from under the bondage of Pharaoh in Egypt. This redemption required blood to be spilled in place (substitute) in order for the sins of the people to be ""passed over"" as the destroyer would go throughout Egypt and kill all the firstborn. Last week, we reflected upon the specifics of the passover meal and feast of unleavened bread. The lamb was the substitute while the people were called to respond to this redemption by living lives of purity. II. The Call of Sanctification (vv. 12:50 - 13:2) Read Exodus 12:50 - 13:2 Notice two things: ""The same day"" - On the very day of that the people were leaving Egypt God provides some important instruction. (see next item. ""Sanctify to Me every firstborn..."" - The instruction was simple. They are to respond to their deliverance by ""sanctifying"" every firstborn. So, what does it mean to SANCTIFY? Sanctification is easy to understand. It has to do with holiness, and the ""setting apart"" for special use. To understand this, lets turn to John 17:13-19 See John 17:13-19 - Jesus asks our Father to Sanctify us in Truth (set us apart with the truth that is according to His Word.). Jesus' desire is for us to be SET-APART from the world and unto Him! Please note: As we can see in John 17, our Sanctification is something that is constantly improving (progressive) as we grow more and more separate from the world. But, it is also positional. 1 Cor. 1:26-31 - Paul's point is that Christ is our sanctification (our holiness, purification) once and for all. So, while we have positional sanctification, we also are called to progressive sanctification (constant growth towards being set-apart for Him.) Come back to Exodus 13:1-2 - With this kind of sanctification in view, we can better understand what the Lord is telling Moses to do. Sanctify to Me every firstborn...! - God is telling them this: ""I have now freed you! So, dedicate yourselves unto me, including your children. Don't fall into the other philosophies and teachings of the world. I am your Father! Serve Me exclusively! III. The Purpose of Sanctification (vv. 3-10) As we continue into these other verses, lets look at the Purpose of Sanctification. Note: As we look at this term sanctification, please know that we are referring to progressive sanctification, not positional. Why? Because positionally they are already sanctified by the substitute sacrifice, but there is still much room for their growth in purity and holiness! QQ - So, what is the purpose of (progressive) Sanctification? In other words, what should be some of the benefits of them (and us) pursuing a greater degree of separateness from the world? (I have THREE reasons from this passage that I feel answers these questions)"
Deuteronomy 31:8,"('Faith', ""God's Timing"", 'Relationship')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," He's Preparing the Way! Ephesians 2:7-10 MSG 7-10 Now God has us where he wants us, with all the time in this world and the next to shower grace and kindness upon us in Christ Jesus. Saving is all his idea, and all his work. All we do is trust him enough to let him do it. It's God's gift from start to finish! We don't play the major role. If we did, we'd probably go around bragging that we'd done the whole thing! No, we neither make nor save ourselves. God does both the making and saving. He creates each of us by Christ Jesus to join him in the work he does, the good work he has gotten ready for us to do, work we had better be doing. Im sure everyone has heard the old cliche, we sure were in the right place at the right time. Some call it destiny, some call it fate and they could be right. But for those of us who know Jesus as Lord and Saviour, we are well aware and know it could only be God. Taking care of one of His own, going before them and preparing the way in advance. So just when they need it most, His Grace was already there, well able and ready to meet every need. Amen? Years ago there was a hit country song called already there, it was by the group Lone star and the chorus went like this; I'm already there Take a look around I'm the sunshine in your hair I'm the shadow on the ground I'm the whisper in the wind I'm your imaginary friend And I know I'm in your prayers Oh, I'm already there And amazingly, that's how God is with each and everyone of us! Everywhere we go, He goes. Everywhere we are, that's where God is. Having already prepared the way for us to arrive at, without worry or care! Deuteronomy 31:8 NKJ 8 And the Lord, He is the One who goes before you. He will be with you, He will not leave you nor forsake you; do not fear nor be dismayed."" If you are willing to seek God to be the source for the direction in your life, He won't let you down. He will keep His promises to you and He takes each one of His promises very seriously! Psalms 121:1-8 NKJ 121 I will lift up my eyes to the hills-- From whence comes my help? 2 My help comes from the Lord, Who made heaven and earth. 3 He will not allow your foot to be moved; He who keeps you will not slumber. 4 Behold, He who keeps Israel Shall neither slumber nor sleep. 5 The Lord is your keeper; The Lord is your shade at your right hand. 6 The sun shall not strike you by day, Nor the moon by night. 7 The Lord shall preserve you from all evil; He shall preserve your soul. 8 The Lord shall preserve your going out and your coming in From this time forth, and even forevermore. Illus. By Steven Grant How Much is that? Now Im sure you've heard the story that before Eve was created, God was talking with Adam. He said, ""You really need a helper, don't you?"" And Adam answered, ""Yeah, I really do."" So God said, ""What if I make a woman? She'll be perfect for you. She'll be beautiful. She'll rub your back at night, & your feet in the morning. She'll plop grapes into your mouth. She'll prepare all your favorite meals without fail. She'll clean up the kitchen & take care of the kids. You'll never have to do a thing, just sit around & be the king of your household."""
Ephesians 6:10-14,"('War On Worship', ""Devil's Tactics"", 'Enemy Defeated')",Pentecostal," Spiritual Warfare RECOGNIZE: Recognizing you're in a war is a big part of victory, because knowing the enemy's tactics is to be in the light - and the devil works in darkness. The devil takes advantage of our ignorance, but when there's light, he can't do what he planned. The Bible teaches us to be alert, which means ""to watch."" We must keep our eyes on Jesus at all times - but also on the devil. The Bible says we must not be ignorant but instead, ""stand firm against the devil's schemes."" The enemies we face are not ""bad vibes,"" or ""negative energies in the universe,"" or the ""dark side of the force."" They are personalities who think, talk, listen, observe, and plan strategies. (II Cor. 2:11; Eph. 6:11) If we watch, we'll recognize the strategies of the enemy in our lives as well as in society. Do you see a pattern of hurt and rejection in your life? Or perhaps you're bothered by suicidal thoughts, or by the slow deadly escape of dope and booze. Does something always seem to happen to keep your family or church in strife? Look for the enemy's strategies and recognize the patterns - then go to the second ""R."" REFUSE: Refusing Satan is passive warfare. Once you recognize what he is up to, ignore it and avoid it. Turn away and begin to worship the Lord and lift Him up. Refuse to be hurt. Refuse to get angry. Just let it go by. That's warfare. Nothing defeats the devil faster than ignoring what he's trying to stir up. RESIST: This is active warfare! We're told to ""Resist the devil and he will flee from you."" God won't resist him - you have to. Speak to him and say, ""Devil, I cut off this strategy in Jesus' Name. You've been doing this to me for 15 years, but I'm on to you and IT'S OVER!"" He may try it six more times, but when you've convinced him that you're convinced of your spiritual authority he will stop (Jas. 4:7; I Pet 5:9)"
James 4:7,"('Satan Attacks', 'Resist Devil', 'Fear Breeds Fear', 'Submit To God')",Pentecostal," Satan's Descriptions=Satan's Strategies! Liar: He is the father, inspirer, and creator of lies. His goal is to steal God's glory and plan through God's people (John 8:44) and to stimulate us to lie (Acts 5:3)! Enemy: He is totally dedicated to the opposition of the children of God with destructive ferocity (I Peter 5:8). Counterfeiter: He is able to present an innocent ""front"" 2 Corinthians (11:14,15). Misleader: He uses evil spirits to mislead Christians in Bible truth and doctrine (I Timothy 4:1). Deceiver: He seeks by all possible means to create false impressions and misunderstandings, and use innuendoes, to cause us to fight amongst each other (Revelation 12:9; II Thessalonians 2:9,10). Promoter of pride: He stimulates humanity's high appraisal of itself (Genesis 3:5; I Timothy 3:6). Outwitter (Luke 22:32; 2 Cor. 2:11; 11:3-15; Eph. 6:16): He probes us for weakness, then misleads, misdirects and undermines our strengths, hopes, faith and love in the wrong direction, away from God's will. Blinder of people's minds: His purpose is to keep individuals in darkness (ignorance) of the light of the Gospel (2 Corinthians 4:4). Ruler of darkness: His kingdom is totally without the light of truth, peace and love (Acts 26:18; 2 Corinthians 6:14; Colossians 1:13; I John 2:9-Il). Director of demonic activity: He controls an army of evil spirits, not limited to ""demons"". Remember he controls only a third; God has 2/3rds (Matthew 12:24; Ephesians 6:12)!!! Suppressor of the Word of God: He constantly seeks to block the proclamation, acceptance, and use of the Scriptures Matthew 13:38,39). Hinderer: He seeks to put things in the way of the Christian seeking to do God's will (I Thessalonians 2:18). He also is opposed to our prayers and fights against them (Dan. 10:12-11:1). Oppressor: He uses depression and discouragement as weapons to undermine the Christian's sense of purpose (Acts 10:38; 1 Kings 19). Troubler: He seeks to invade the physical realm and to limit the strength of God's children (2 Corinthians 12:7). Accuser and slanderer: His name, Devil, or ""diabolos"" (Greek), means a person who throws things at people (Revelation 12:10). Creator of division: He is out to cause dissension and disagreement between Christians (2 Corinthians 2:10,11; James 3:13-16). Trickster: He uses subtle ways and means of confusing the Lord's people (Ephesians 6:11). Tempter: His plan is to persuade us to take an alternate course to God's way (Matthew 4:1 - 11; Luke 4:1-13; I Thessalonians 3:5). Ensnarer: He is out to trap the Christian to commit sin, thus ruining and spoiling his testimony (I Timothy 3:7). Stimulator of lust: He distorts normal desires, by taking God's design and inflaming it; uncontrolled sensuality (emotions) is a tool of Satan (Ephesians 2:2,3). Counterfeiter: He is capable of presenting an innocent ""front"" (2 Corinthians 11:14,15)."
Psalms 37:23,"('Crecimiento', 'Caminar', 'La Gracia De Dios')",Assembly Of God," Introducción: Todos nosotros tenemos una historia diferente; dentro de nuestra historia cada una de ellas tienen matices diferentes. Hay historias que están llenas de mucha alegría, hay otras que están llenas de dolor, frustraciones, desengaños, desalientos, logros, victorias en fin cada una de nuestra historia tiene un color diferente. Lo que si estoy seguro es que nuestras historias en particular tienen algo en común. Y es que todas tuvieron un comienzo. No sabemos cómo comenzó, pero si sabemos que tuvo un comienzo y lo más probable es que el principio de nuestra historia comenzó con un ""paso."" Hay un antigua proverbio que dice ""Un viaje de mis millas comienza con un paso"". Entonces es importante que nosotros podamos entender lo crucial que es nuestro caminar. I. Primero que Dios hace es que endereza nuestros pasos ""Proverbios 3:5-6 Proverbios 3:5-6 Fíate de Jehová de todo tu corazón, Y no te apoyes en tu propia prudencia. Reconócelo en todos tus caminos, Y él enderezará tus veredas."" "" ""En otras palabras, el verso dice: Confía en el SEÑOR de todo corazón, y no en tu propia inteligencia. Reconócelo en todos tus caminos."" (NIV) "" Cuando reconocemos a Dios en nuestros caminos dejamos que El intervenga en nuestras vidas. "" Creer plenamente en que Dios tiene nuestros pasos guardados es reconocer la soberanía de Dios en nuestras vidas. "" El hombre es muy ambivalente como para saber a dónde se dirige. Sin embargo, cuando caminamos bajo la sombra del omnipotente tenemos claridad. "" Dice la biblia ""Hay caminos que al hombre le parecen rectos; pero si fin es muerte."" (Mostrar Video) "" Como podemos ver el corredor ya estaba listo para ganar su carrera sin embargo tomo un giro equivocado. "" Si nuestros pasos están torcidos nuestras vidas estarán torcidas "" Nuestros pasos determinan nuestros caminos y el lugar en donde estemos llegando. "" (Es probable que en un mal paso en mal movimiento te hayas caído, pero solo necesitas otro paso en la dirección correcta para ponerte de pies.) (Un paso te destruye y un paso te reconstruye) II. Lo segundo que Dios hace es que nos guía los pasos. Salmo 23:3 Confortará mi alma; Me guiará por sendas de justicia por amor de su nombre. "" Uno de los errores más grandes que los cristianos cometemos es que pensamos que nosotros caminamos en santidad por nuestros propios méritos. "" No son nuestros méritos los que hacen que estemos bien. "" Quien nos guía por sendas de justicias es Dios y lo hace por amor de su nombre. "" Es Dios que produce el querer como el hacer por su buena voluntad. Jeremías 10:23 Conozco, oh Jehová, que el hombre no es señor de su camino, ni del hombre que camina es el ordenar sus pasos. "" Dios guía nuestros pasos... Salmo 18:33-34 Dios es el que me ciñe de poder, Y quien hace perfecto mi camino; Quien hace mis pies como de ciervas, Y me hace estar firme sobre mis alturas; III. Lo tercero que Dios hace es que encamina nuestros pasos y nos da dirección. Salmo 48:14 Porque este Dios es Dios nuestro eternamente y para siempre; Él nos guiará aún más allá de la muerte."

The impetuous disciple was so awestruck that he did not really know what he was saying. Just in that moment a cloud covered the little group on the mountain, and out of the cloud a voice spoke: ""This is my beloved Son, hear Him."" When the cloud of God's presence lifted from the scene, the three disciples - Peter, James and John - could no longer see Moses and Elijah, but ""Jesus only"" with themselves (Mark 9:8). The Lord is turning our attention away from the law and the prophets - represented by Moses and Elijah - and is instructing us to listen to Jesus. One greater than the law and the prophets, greater than Elijah - and greater even than Moses himself - is here! *JESUS IS GREATER THAN MOSES Hebrews 3:1-6 The writer to the Hebrews was at pains to ensure that the eyes of his readers remained focussed on Jesus. For Hebrew Christians to go back to the law of Moses was not an option. Moses was faithful - but Jesus is counted worthy of more glory than Moses. In the Old Testament, God spoke through dreams and visions, through type and prophecy, and through the sacrifices and ceremonies of a complex cultic ritual (Hebrews 1:1). With some, like Abraham and Moses, He spoke almost 'face to face' (Numbers 12:6-8) - but the fathers were walking in the shadow of the promise, and not in the fullness that we now enjoy. When Jesus came, it was not to abolish all that had gone before, but to bring it to fulfilment (Matthew 5:17). Moses was a witness speaking of things which were still in the future. Jesus is the final word (Hebrews 1:2). Despite his initial reluctance, Moses did everything that God commanded him (Exodus 40:16). Moses was like a faithful old retainer in a mighty house: but Jesus is the one who built the house. Moses was a servant of the house: but Jesus is the founder and head over His own house; ""whose house are we..."" (Hebrews 3:6). *Imagine an ""A to Z"" of the New Testament names of Jesus. Under ""G"" we would find references to His Glory, His God-hood, and His Goodness. Then we would find several references to His Greatness: - 1. GREATER THAN ABRAHAM John 8:53 In talking to some Jews in Jerusalem who had professed belief in Jesus, the Lord sought to encourage them. ""If you continue in my word, then are you my disciples indeed: and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free"" (John 8:31-32). This aroused the ire of His hearers: ""We are Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man"" (John 8:33). Had they forgotten Egypt; and Babylon, and Persia, and Greece - and Rome? Had they forgotten the Caesar who currently ruled over them with an iron fist? Jesus did not doubt that these new would-be converts were of the seed of Abraham, but He rebuked them for having such an antipathy to His word that they even harboured murderous intentions against Him (John 8:37). If they were really Abraham's children, surely, they would not do this (John 8:39-40)? They accused Him of being a Samaritan and having a devil - the two epithets tripped so readily together off their lips (John 8:48)."

Job 36:1-33,"('Righteous', 'Speak For God', 'Ascribe Righteousness', 'Perfect In Knowledge', 'God Is Mighty')",Calvary Chapel," Job 36: 1 - 33 From Wrong Things Said To Wrong Things Done 1 Elihu also proceeded and said: 2 ""Bear with me a little, and I will show you that there are yet words to speak on God's behalf. 3 I will fetch my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 4 For truly my words are not false; one who is perfect in knowledge is with you. 5 ""Behold, God Is mighty, but despises no one; He Is mighty in strength of understanding. 6 He does not preserve the life of the wicked, but gives justice to the oppressed. 7 He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous; But they are on the throne with kings, for He has seated them forever, and they are exalted. 8 And if they are bound in fetters, held in the cords of affliction, 9 then He tells them their work and their transgressions--that they have acted defiantly. 10 He also opens their ear to instruction, and commands that they turn from iniquity. 11 If they obey and serve Him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. 12 But if they do not obey, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge. 13 ""But the hypocrites in heart store up wrath; they do not cry for help when He binds them. 14 They die in youth, and their life ends among the perverted persons. 15 He delivers the poor in their affliction, and opens their ears in oppression. 16 ""Indeed He would have brought you out of dire distress, into a broad place where there is no restraint; And what is set on your table would be full of richness. 17 But you are filled with the judgment due the wicked; Judgment and justice take hold of you. 18 Because there is wrath, beware lest He take you away with one blow; For a large ransom would not help you avoid it. 19 Will your riches, or all the mighty forces, keep you from distress? 20 Do not desire the night, when people are cut off in their place. 21 Take heed, do not turn to iniquity, for you have chosen this rather than affliction. 22 ""Behold, God is exalted by His power; who teaches like Him? 23 Who has assigned Him His way, or who has said, 'You have done wrong'? 24 ""Remember to magnify His work, of which men have sung. 25 Everyone has seen it; man looks on it from afar. 26 ""Behold, God is great, and we do not know Him; nor can the number of His years be discovered. 27 For He draws up drops of water, which distill as rain from the mist, 28 which the clouds drop down and pour abundantly on man. 29 Indeed, can anyone understand the spreading of clouds, the thunder from His canopy? 30 Look, He scatters His light upon it, and covers the depths of the sea. 31 For by these He judges the peoples; He gives food in abundance. 32 He covers His hands with lightning, and commands it to strike. 33 His thunder declares it, the cattle also, concerning the rising storm. From wrong things that we say to wrongs things that we do, we can be certain that our Holy Lord God, will deal with each one and not overlook them. Our Holy Father does not ignore our sins. He forgives our sins as it is written in the book of Numbers chapter 14 verse 18, ""The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.'"

Ephesians 1:1-2,"('Paul', 'Grace', 'Call', 'Believers')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Scripture Today I would like to begin a new series of sermons. For seven Sundays, I plan to preach through Ephesians 1 in a series I am calling, ""God's Supreme Purpose."" That will take us to the Missions Conference at the end of February. After the Missions Conference, I plan to do a different sermon series until Easter. And then, after Easter, I may return and do another series of sermons on Ephesians 2. My plan for the foreseeable future is to preach shorter series of expositional messages from different parts of Scripture, but we will eventually get through Ephesians! Let's begin by reading Paul's introduction to the Ephesians in Ephesians 1:1-2: 1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints who are in Ephesus, and are faithful in Christ Jesus: 2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. (Ephesians 1:1-2) Introduction Last week, my wife and I had the privilege of visiting our daughter and son-in-law in the city of Bogotá, the capital city of Colombia. On one of our daily excursions, we visited Monserrate, a mountain that dominates the city center of Bogotá. Monserrate rises 10,407 feet above the sea level, and is about 1,800 feet above the city below. We accessed Monserrate by a funicular on the way up, and descended by a cable car on the way down. While on top of Monserrate we had a magnificent view of downtown Bogotá, south Bogotá, and some sections north of the city. Monserrate is a mountain that is visible from many parts of the city below. It is easy to see why residents of Bogotá take visitors to the top of Monserrate because it is the place from which one can get the best possible view of Bogotá. Paul's letter to the Ephesians stands in relation to the rest of his writings rather like Monserrate. It isn't the longest or fullest of his writings, but it offers a breathtaking view of the biblical landscape. From Paul's letter to the Ephesians you get a magnificent view of biblical truth: God, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, the church, the means of salvation, our position in Christ, our practice as Christians, marriage, family, and spiritual warfare. Like a visitor to Bogota who visits the top of Monserrate, you will be able to see magnificent views of biblical truth in Paul's letter to the Ephesians. Over the course of time, I hope to work through the entire letter of Paul to the Ephesians. Ephesians consists of only six chapters. In the pew Bible, it is only four pages long. It contains 155 verses. It will take you only about 20 minutes to read the entire letter aloud. Yet, it is an incredibly powerful letter. Commentator William Barclay calls Ephesians ""the queen of the epistles."" John Mackay, a former president of Princeton Theological Seminary who was converted at the age of fourteen through reading Ephesians, called it the ""greatest... maturest... [and] for our time the most relevant"" of all Paul's writings. ""This letter is pure music,"" he said. Missionary Ruth Paxson called Ephesians ""the Grand Canyon of Scripture,"" meaning that it is breathtakingly beautiful and apparently inexhaustible to the one who wants to take it in. And commentator Klyne Snodgrass wrote, ""Pound for pound Ephesians may well be the most influential document ever written."""
Acts 13:1-4,"('Holy Spirit', 'Obedience', 'Sovereignty', 'Mission Field')",United Methodist," Everything was going well at the church at Antioch. The leadership team presided over a growing and vibrant cross-cultural church. This new church plant already was held in high repute and had reached the ears of the Apostles and leaders of the parent church at Jerusalem. It only made good sense in human wisdom to leave well enough alone. This team was producing great results. But it has been said that ""God works in mysterious ways; His wonders to perform."" This mysterious way of God is clearly demonstrated in this morning's passage. Let us take a look. Five men from the leadership are mentioned in the passage. Of these, we know nothing else about Simeon, Lucius, and Manaen other than they were called prophets and teachers of the church there. More in known about Barnabas and Paul who were included among them. They were the team who ruled over the church at Antioch. The text says that they were fasting and performing their spiritual duty, most probably in a worship setting when the Holy Spirit spoke. The Holy Spirit said that He desired to separate Barnabas and Saul (Paul) for His special purpose. The Greek verb here in in the perfect tense which indicates a permanent separation from their leadership positions at Antioch. The church responded by continuing to fast and pray. After this, they laid hands on Barnabas and Paul and sent them on their way. Apparently more was revealed to Barnabas and Saul as they went out to the port of Selucia and made sail to Cyprus in obedience to the Holy Spirit. If one looks at the Greek further, it should be noted that the main sentences are ""The Holy Spirit spoke;"" ""The church dismissed them;"" ""They departed to the port of Selucia;"" and ""They sailed to Cyprus."" Everything else is grammatically subordinate to these statements. Why is this important? First of all, it clearly demonstrates the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit over the Church. The fasting and worship of the church did not cause the Holy Spirit to come. As important as fasting, worship, service and prayer are, they are not sovereign over the move of the Holy Spirit. Rather, the Spirit spoke on His own authority for His own purpose. This shows by the way that the Holy Spirit is equally God with the Father and the Son. It happened to be that the church was at worship and fasting at the time. And even these things were ordained by the Lord. The work of God is not in any way dependent upon the works of men, even the ones He has ordained. Surely, the church is called to fast, pray, worship, lay hands upon ordinands, do works of mercy and such. But God even used Saul the King to prophesy, even though Saul was in manifest disobedience to the God. John records that the wicked Caiaphas also prophesied by the Holy Spirit because Caiaphas was High Priest. Saul of Tarsus was not in a prayer meeting on the way to Damascus when the Lord Jesus appeared to Him. There have also been many occasions of the obedient church fasting, praying and worshipping where the Holy Spirit did not audibly speak."
1 Corinthians 14:36-15:38,"('Culture', 'Inerrancy', 'Apostle', 'Command Of God')",Assembly Of God," 1Co 14 36 What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only? 37 If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord. 38 But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant. Paul is the most maligned apostle of all the apostles. If it were only by the Jews of his day, that would be understandable. The problem is that he received more friendly fire than enemy fire. He had to defend himself to the church in Jerusalem and against those who came to undermine his ministry at Corinth. Worst of all, he had to defend himself to the very people he won to Christ. It was not easy being Paul then and it is just as hard today. The various groups today pick and choose his writings and some even question his apostleship today stating that much of his writings are not inspired, but just his opinions. Misguided opinions at that. Where they agree with him like in salvation by faith and faith alone they will sing his praises, but where they disagree they will say that it was cultural and not for today or the rants of a misogynist or some other derogatory name. Sometimes they try to play one verse over another though there is no contradiction in the verses, but rather contradiction in our biased interpretation. We have a problem here. Either he is an apostle or not and if not we have even more problems. If he is, then we have no right to question his teachings because we or our culture does not like them. Paul had to deal with a culture that was not much unlike our own so it is really pretty easy to understand and apply his teachings if we are honest with the Word. Indeed, I am a simple man and listening to some of the complicated and sometimes convoluted things people use to toss out some of his teachings or in some way to exalt one teaching over the others gives me a headache. Paul spoke of the simplicity of the Gospel and we have done everything we can but keep the Gospel and Church doctrine simple. That is why we have so many different groups, denominations and non-denominations, despite Christ's goal that we be one and the Holy Spirit being sent to lead us into ALL truth, not essential and non-essential ones or gray areas when in Him there is no variableness or shadow of turning. I get that our Messianic Jewish brothers have some trouble dealing with Paul because even Peter said Paul taught some things hard to be understood, yet he acknowledged Paul's apostleship and doctrine. Paul was and is the Apostle to the nations or Gentiles,us. Like it or not, we are to build our doctrines and practices off of his teachings, not our desires or disagreements. We really have no excuse because we do not have the cultural issues that often hinder our brethren of Jewish descent from fully embracing Paul or doing what we do and try to work around the parts they do not like or find hard to understand. Paul was not what we would call politically correct. He was not called to be that. He was an extremely zealous and studious Jew that defended the faith to the hilt. We cannot expect him to be any less so as a Christian. We also have to give him some closer attention because he received one on one training from Christ in the wilderness for three years. That is more intense than the other Apostles received. They were prepared to minister to the Jews, whose language and customs they knew and it was a twelve member class with one who flunked."
1 Corinthians 16:0-9,"('Obedience', 'Opposition', 'Opportunities', 'Doors')",Assembly Of God," 1 Corinthians 16:9 For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries. 2017 is a great and open door for ministry, The sky is the limit. There are many needs so there is one or two somewhere you can meet whether you are 8 or 88. God is on your side for ministry, When you were saved, He gave you at least one and possibly more spiritual gifts that you are to use for His glory, the health of the Body and even salvation of someone. You will never be content or joyful until you are exercising those gifts. You don't have them to put them on a shelf and let them gather dust like souvenirs. There are always many adversaries whenever there are great opportunities. Your own flesh and excuses will fight you to try and keep you from the success He has for you. Friends and family may try to dissuade you. Grab the vision and opportunity no matter who is trying to wrest it from your grip! If you are seeing an opportunity for some spiritual growth in your life you definitely have adversaries. The devil will attack your weaknesses to keep you in despair and defeat. Again, friends and family may tell you to not get too fanatical. Even Christians who are content in the their doldrums and mediocrity will try to ""reason"" with you that Jesus does not want you to be radical about your faith. Unbelievers will mock you. Never give up! God has other ideas so just turn away from the naysayers and the devil. The devil is a liar and sincere people can be sincerely wrong. Whatever God has shown you and called you to do, YOU CAN DO IT THROUGH HIS POWER! It might be tough. Nothing worth anything comes easy except your salvation. This is a battlefield and you are in the Lord's Army so endure hardness as a good soldier and fight on! Great and effectual doors are open! This is to be your year of victory if you receive it. When He opens the doors run through them listening only to His voice! They can fire at you all they want, but God can deflect that fire as He sets you on fire for Him! Grab on to Jesus and enjoy the battle because it means the enemy is angry. which means victory will be even sweeter! Alleluia! Maranatha!!!"
Mark 5:27-34,"('Fear', 'Healing', 'Revival', 'Crowds')",Assembly Of God," Mar 5:27 When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment. 28 For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole. 29 And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague. 30 And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes? 31 And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? 32 And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing. 33 But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. 34 And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague. If you want revival, do not look at the crowds. Look to Jesus and reach out to Him. No crowd can keep you from Him. All it takes is your faith. He knew who she was, but He wanted her to testify. He does not call secret disciples. When He does something for you, you need to make it known. Indeed, we just need to tell Him all the truth about our need for Him. He is never to busy to turn around and let you see His face and receive what you need. That meeting is your salvation or your revival depending on where you are spiritually at that moment. Reach out and touch Him! You are not lost in a crowd. God sees You as if you were the only person before Him. Praise His name!!!"

THE HIGH CALLING OF GOD IN CHRIST JESUS Philippians 3:14 When we are converted, we have a change of mind, a change of heart. Yet this is not only a once-for-all experience, but also an on-going process which will not be completed this side of eternity. We have been changed, we are being changed, we will be changed. Even a seasoned warrior like the Apostle Paul did not consider himself to have 'arrived' (as we might say), but he was casting the past into oblivion and stretching forward to whatever lay in store in the future (Philippians 3:13). He was pursuing the mark, dashing for the goal-line, running towards the tape at the end of the race. He was pursuing the prize - ever onward, ever upward - the heavenly reward of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus (Philippians 3:14). There are two sides to the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. ""The hope of His calling"" in Ephesians 1:18 becomes ""The hope of your calling"" in Ephesians 4:4. He called us before ever we called on Him. A. HE CALLED US Romans 8:28-39 God, in His foreknowledge, predestined some out of the mass of fallen mankind to be conformed to the image of His Son. He called them, justified them, and glorified them. He continues to work all things for good in favour of ""the called"" who love Him. It is because of the efficacy of this call that Paul, and the believer, can be assured of the affirmations that conclude this chapter. Since God is for us, who can be against us (Romans 8:31)? The Apostle points us to the cross, and encourages us to embrace all that God so lavishly bestows upon us (Romans 8:32). Paul goes on to reassure us that there is no-one to accuse us, because God has chosen us (Romans 8:33). Because God condemned sin in His flesh (Romans 8:3), there is now no-one to condemn us (Romans 8:34): Christ died for us, and the Father accepted the sacrifice of the Son by raising Him from the dead. The Lord is seated at the right hand of God, His work completed (cf. Hebrews 1:3), ever interceding on our behalf. So, who is about to separate us from the love of Christ (Romans 8:35)? There is nothing and no-one that can possibly separate us from the love of God which is ours in Christ Jesus our Lord (Romans 8:39)! B. WE CALLED ON HIM, TO SAVE US Romans 10:8-13 We are called to heart belief. Whoever believes in Jesus shall not be ashamed. Whoever calls upon His name shall be saved. Heart belief is a sincere and personal acceptance of the truth which God has revealed to us. The word of God which is near to us, in our mouth and in our heart, testifies to our inability to keep the law of God. It testifies of our sinfulness. It testifies that the wages of sin is death, eternal separation from God. It testifies of our need of a saviour. It testifies that Jesus Christ is the only Saviour of sinners, that He laid down His life for our sins and that God raised Him from the dead that we might live in Him. This faith is not merely an agreement with the facts of the gospel. Even the devils believe in the truth of the gospel. And tremble (James 2:19)!

Matthew 2:1-12,"('Christmas', 'Worship', 'Acceptable Worship')",Independent/Bible," Listen to what the Scriptures say. Wise men from the East came seeking for Jesus. "" Through the study of the stars and the revelation of the Holy Spirit, they were enlightened to know that the Messiah, King of the Jews was born, in Israel. "" They came seeking and inquiring, and was told to go to Bethlehem. God showed them the way to Jesus, through a moving star. The Wise Men asked, ""Where is the ONE who has been born king of the Jews?"" - that's the REASON for their visit. "" They said they ""have come to worship him"" (2:2) - that's the PURPOSE of their visit. "" The reason for their visit is JESUS. The purpose of their visit is to WORSHIP Him. No wonder the Scriptures called them Magi, or Wise Men. They were wise not just for the knowledge they have. "" They were wise because they sought Jesus, and for the RIGHT reason - worship Him. "" They worship Him because He is worthy, He is the Messiah, the Son of God. He is no ordinary child. WORSHIP IS ABOUT WHO, NOT WHAT Worship is all about WHO and not WHAT. They came to see and worship Jesus. "" It is not about WHAT Jesus has done or can do for them, not at this point of time. "" We know that Jesus would eventually, as His name indicates, ""save His people from their sins"". (Mt 1:21) And for that, we worship Him. No question about that. "" But at this point of time, the wise men came only for WHO He is. They worship Jesus because He is God. Period. Herod too, claimed that he wanted to worship Jesus. He said, ""As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship Him."" (2:8) "" But we know from passage he has no intention to worship Jesus. He wants to KILL Jesus. His worship was just a talk, a disguise. His ""worship"" is fake. The wise men came to WORSHIP Jesus for WHO He is. Not for what Jesus can OFFER them or the BENEFITS they can get. "" When they arrived at the house, Jesus was probably a young boy, maybe two years old or younger. "" He couldn't even hold a conversation with them. He was incapable of giving them anything, not counsel or help of any kind. "" It would look more like the other way around, Jesus needing help from the adults. The traditional picture of the wise men coming into a stable to see the infant Jesus in a manger is not accurate. 2:11 ""On coming to the house..."" not a stable. 2:7 ""Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared."" 2:16 ""When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi."" To make sure that he got it covered, Herod killed all boys 2 years and younger. Jesus was likely 2 years old or younger, not a baby lying in a manger. And the wise men came to worship JESUS. WORSHIP IS ABOUT GIVING, NOT GETTING The wise men did not come to GET something but GIVE. They were prepared to GIVE. "" The moment they decided to make this long and arduous journey, they had already started giving - their time, their efforts, their comfort, their treasures."
2 Samuel 12:1-13,"('Sin', 'Repentance')",Independent/Bible," We are going to talk about a common experience today, and how to deal with it. "" Since Adam and Eve, man has been reliving this problem countless times. And many still do not know how to deal with it. "" What to do when we sin against God? Let's read 2 Samuel 12:1-13. David sinned big time. He committed adultery with Bathsheba, someone's wife. "" She became pregnant, and David tried to COVER it up. "" He urged Bathsheba's husband URIAH (his loyal soldier), to go home and spend time with his wife. So that no one could find out this child was actually his. And when that didn't succeed, David plotted to have Uriah killed in battle by sending him to the fiercest front line. "" Uriah died. It looked more like a heroic death and no one suspected anything. "" And David married the grieving widow in a sympathetic move. It was the ""perfect"" plan. "" But we know better. 11:27 ends with this verdict: ""But the thing David had done displeased the Lord."" So far we have been hearing good things about David, generally speaking. This comes as a shocker to us, but also a grave reminder, that no one is immune from this. "" It is not all the good works that we have done that will immune us from sin - 10 good works versus one wrong move. It is not the balance of good works versus sinful deeds. "" It is all about a relationship with God. Only God can resolve the problem of sin, and only God can remove the plague of sin in our lives. David started with man's way of dealing with sin - a crime is committed, we find a way to cover it up. And then we make attempts to camouflage it, as if it's not there. "" These are all wrong ways of dealing with sin, which we are so familiar with. "" We pretend that it's not there but the only person we are really deceiving is ourselves - because we know it's there, and so does God. The only resolution to sin is to bring it to God. You cannot surprise Him with it. "" God has the ultimate solution to the problem of sin. He has the ability to free us from its bondage and power over us. "" Prov 28:13 ""Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper, but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy."" James 5:19-20 ""19My brothers, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring him back, 20consider this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and cover over a multitude of sins."" "" There is a COVERING made available and it is not the COVER UP we are talking about. "" This COVERING is a covering of MERCY. It happens when we confess and renounce our sin. It's the FORGIVENESS of our sin we receive when we TURN BACK to God. Only God can truly COVER sin for good and He did that through Jesus Christ. "" When Adam and Eve sinned and admitted it, God made ""garments of skin"" (Gen 3:21) as coverings for them. This is the first shedding of blood. "" Heb 9:22 ""...without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness."" If only God can effectively deal with sin, then David must come back to God. "" So God steps in. 12:1 ""The Lord sent Nathan to David."" God initiated the move and stepped in."
"2 Samuel 12:1-13, Psalms 51:1-19","('Forgiveness', 'Repentance', 'Serve God')",Independent/Bible," We deal with sin WITH God, not apart from Him. Without God, the problem of sin can never be resolved. "" Last week we saw God initiating the move to confront David of his sin. "" Nathan enlightened David, recounted the facts and stated the consequences. David saw the light and repented immediately. ""I have sinned against the Lord."" (12:13a). No denial, no excuses, and no beating around the bush. "" Nathan's reply was equally immediate: ""The Lord has taken away your sin. You are not going to die."" (12:13b) "" That was God's ultimate purpose - not to condemn him but to restore him. He repented and God forgave him. David expresses this reality in his Psalm 32:1-5. "" 1 ""Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. 2 Blessed is the man whose sin the LORD does not count against him and in whose spirit is no deceit. "" 3 When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. 4 For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer. [Selah] "" 5 Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity. I said, ""I will confess my transgressions to the LORD"" - and you forgave the guilt of my sin."" "" 6 Therefore let everyone who is godly pray to you while you may be found..."" We learnt from David first-hand how to RECOVER from sin, from the prayer he made to God after Nathan's visit, in PSALM 51. Psalm 51:1-6 Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions. 2 Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin. 3 For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me. 4 Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you are proved right when you speak and justified when you judge. 5 Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me. [sinful nature] 6 Surely you desire truth in the inner parts; you teach me wisdom in the inmost place. (1) TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR SIN This is the first and most important step. Without this, there is no healing. Everything will be status quo. He ACKNOWLEDGED his sin and then... Psalm 51:7-9 7 Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow. 8 Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones you have crushed rejoice. 9 Hide your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquity. * Hyssop is an herb (in the mint family) used for purification and cleansing. (2) ASK FOR GOD'S FORGIVENESS Confess/Repent David asks God to do what only GOD can do - cleanse, wash, and blot out. "" God alone can forgive sin, and remove sin. The only solution we have with sin is to bring it to God. Healing starts when forgiveness flows. "" Hiding sin, David says In Psalm 32 ""his bones were crushed through his groaning all day along"" but when he confess and receive forgiveness, ""let the bones you have crushed rejoice"". Confess and repent, and ask God to forgive you. A prayer we need to make when we sin, and God will remove the stain of sin from our lives."
Revelation 6:1-2,"('White Horse', 'First Seal')",Baptist," First Seal: the White Horse and Its Rider Commentary on the Book of Revelation By: Tom Lowe Date: 8-26-15 TOPIC # III: VISIONS OF JUDGMENT AGAINST JERUSALEM (4:1-11:19) Subtopic B: The Opening of Seven Seals (6.1-8.1) Lesson: III.B.1: First Seal: the White Horse and Its Rider (Revelation 6:1-2) Revelation 6:1-2 (KJV) 1 And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see. 2 And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. Introduction to Chapter 6 This is the first of three seven-part judgments. Chapters 6-16 form the core of Revelation. Chapters 1-5 are introductory, and chapters 17-22 conclude the book of Revelation; chapters 6-16 describe the seal judgments (chapter 6), the trumpet judgments (chapters 8-9), and the bowl (vial) judgments (chapters 15-16), with interludes between them. In chapter 5, a scroll with seven seals had been handed to Christ, who is the only one worthy to break the seals and open the scroll, setting into motion the events leading up to the end of the world (5:1-5). In chapter 6, the scroll is opened as each seal is broken. The scroll is not completely opened until the seventh seal is broken (8:1). The contents of the scroll reveal mankind's depravity and portray God's authority over the events of human history. Let me say here that these judgments are future; they have not been fulfilled as yet. ""The day of vengeance of our God"" (Isaiah 61:2) has not yet come upon the earth, but it is drawing near. Up to the present our God's throne has not been one of judgment but of grace. Each of the judgments (seals, trumpets, bowls) consist of seven parts; the first four judgments involve natural disasters on the earth, and the last three are cosmic disasters. There are three views about how to understand this series of judgments--seals, trumpets, bowls: Recapitulation View. According to this view, the three sets of judgments repeat each other (are cyclical); they presented three ways of viewing the same judgments. Because the trumpets and the bowls have the same order, many have concluded that the three sets are repetitive. In addition, in all three sets, the first four of the seven judgments are very similar, as are the last three of each set of seven. Exact repetition, however, occurs only in the trumpets and bowels. Consecutive View. This view maintains that judgments will follow in the order described in Revelation: first the seals, then the trumpets, then the bowls--in other words, Revelation is describing 21 separate events. For that reason, chapters 6-16 in Revelation would be chronological. Progressive Intensification View. The key to this view is understanding the results of the judgments. The seals destroy one-fourth of the earth; the trumpets destroy one-third; the bowls affect everything. The picture seems to be one of progressive intensity, with each of these sets of judgments ending in the same place--that is, the end of history."
Proverbs 7:21-23,"('Pornography', 'Homosexual', 'Fornicacion', 'Adulterous Woman', 'Sex Within Marriage')",Pentecostal," Internet pornographers target web sites and addresses that appear to be Christian. The enemy knows that porno is a HIGHLY addictive force in his arsenal of evil tricks. I had a bad experience with pornography myself, I am not proud to admit it, but if it will help another man get free from it Praise Jesus! When I was about 13 years old I found a trunk that belonged to my brother in the attic, it was filled with pornographic magazines and photos. I guess my brother realized I found it, because weeks later it vanished from the house. The damage was already done! Those pictures have haunted me for years. I know I have a weakness for the stuff, (all men do) so like the scriptures tell us ""flee fornication..."" The word fornication comes from the root Greek word PORNEA. God is saying FLEE (run in terror) from PORNOGRAPHY! When I was in the military I was surrounded by it! I had to request a change in roommates on 2 occasions because they were porno addicts. If I stayed their roommates I would have fallen back into the love of it. Even now I have to deal with images from years past. Even past relationships linger in our minds because of the power of the sexual union. Sex was meant to give pleasure to a husband and wife, but also it is a covenant sealer. When you have sex with someone you are really marrying him or her! The act of sex is the deal sealer! That is why God never meant for you to have multiple partners. If you recall your first sexual experience, good or bad you NEVER forget it! It becomes a strong image in your soul (emotions, will, conscience). The Lord tried to warn Israel about multiple partners, Solomon is the most tragic case. Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines! The scriptures say he ""loved them all"". The love for these women pulled him away from his first love, GOD! Pr 7:21 With persuasive words she led him astray; she seduced him with her smooth talk. Pr 7:22 All at once he followed her like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer stepping into a noose Pr 7:23 till an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare, little knowing it will cost him his life. NIV"
Acts 6:1-10,"('Outreach', 'Deacons', 'Widows And Orphans', 'Help In Trouble', 'Deacon Selection')",Pentecostal," Acts 6:1 ""And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration."" We see, here, the church growing to a large number. As long as the church was small and they each were greatly needed, they were all pulling in one direction. They were working for a common cause. Now that the number has gotten so large, there is murmuring. Some of the Greeks think the Hebrew widows are being cared for better than the Greeks. It seems that the early church was very concerned about the needs of widows. Many times widows lived in the church and prayed for the church. In I Timothy 5:9, Paul tells them to not take a widow under 60 years. Acts 6:2 ""Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples [unto them], and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables."" These twelve disciples who seemed to be the leaders of all the rest are explaining that they should not be encumbered by trying to see to the needs of all of these widows. The man or woman of God ministering has enough to do staying in the Word of God and bringing spiritual guidance to the people. Some one else should see to the financial responsibilities of the church. If they have to stop and see to the physical needs of the people, they will not be able to care for their spiritual needs. Acts 6:3 ""Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business."" Seven, as we have said before, means spiritually complete. We see that these seven were to be men who were very close to God. They must be wise men to take care of the finances of the body of Christ. They must be honest and of good report. This is one of the Scriptures used when churches choose seven deacons to raise the finances of the church. Many people want to be a deacon of the church until they learn that the deacons are really responsible for the financial needs of the church. Acts 6:4 ""But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word."" The twelve apostles were not to be bothered with anything, except the spiritual needs of the people. Perhaps, that is one of the problems in churches today. We have made business men out of our ministers. They learn as much about the way to raise money, to have a bus ministry, and to satisfy the I.R.S. as they do about the Word of God. They really should not be burdened with all of these administration duties. It takes too much of their time away from prayer and study of the Word. Acts 6:5 ""And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:"" Of these seven, of course, Stephen was the most known to us. These men were above reproach. They were men of high character. These men would be fair in all their dealings. Some believe that many of these"
John 11:40-44,"('Faith', 'Glory', 'Healing', 'Power', 'Miracles')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Believe and see the Glory of God! Illus. Waiting for you, By sermon central. A family was out vacationing at the lake one summer. Dad had been puttering out by the boat house. Two of his sons, a 12-year old and a 3-year old were down playing along the dock. The 12 year old was supposed to be watching his little brother, but he got distracted. The 3 year old, little Billy, thought that would be a good time to check out the shiny aluminum fishing boat tied up at the end of the dock. So he went to the dock and put one foot on the boat, and one foot on the dock. He lost his balance and fell into the water, which was about 5 or 6 ft deep. The splash alerted the 12-yr old who let out a piercing scream. Dad came running from the boat house, jumped into the water, swam down, but unable to see anything, came up for air. Sick with panic, he went right back down into this murky water, and began to feel everywhere around the bottom. He couldn't feel anything. Finally, on his way up, he felt little Billy's arms locked in a death grip on one of the posts of the dock, about 4 ft under water. Prying the boy's fingers loose, they burst up together thru the surface to fill their lungs with life giving air. Finally when the adrenaline had stopped surging, and nerves had calmed down a little bit, the Father asked his son, ""What on earth were you doing down there hanging onto the post so far under the water? And little Billy's answer was a classic, laced with the wisdom only a toddler could give. He said, ""I was just waiting for you dad. Just waiting for you."" John 11:40-44 MSG 40 Jesus looked her in the eye. ""Didn't I tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?"" 41-42 Then, to the others, ""Go ahead, take away the stone."" They removed the stone. Jesus raised his eyes to heaven and prayed, ""Father, I'm grateful that you have listened to me. I know you always do listen, but on account of this crowd standing here I've spoken so that they might believe that you sent me."" 43-44 Then he shouted, ""Lazarus, come out!"" And he came out, a cadaver, wrapped from head to toe, and with a kerchief over his face. Jesus told them, ""Unwrap him and let him loose."" Just a guess and purely conjecture, but I imagine if Jesus would've ask Lazarus what he had been doing, he would've have said waiting for you Lord, just waiting for you! When we are in search of a miracle, who's glory are we seeking our miracle for? Ourselves, or the ones we're praying for? When we receive the miracle, we are definitely the beneficiary aren't we? Wether we're the ones praying or receiving, we are the beneficiaries! But after the mountains been pushed into the sea and disappears, what happens to the glory? Jesus could have easily spoken the miracle into existence and received all the glory, but He chose instead to glorify His Father! All the glory for everything good that is done for us and on our behalf, belongs to God and no one else!"
Romans 12:16-21,"('Abortion', 'Doing Good')",Catholic," Matthew's account of the Sermon on the Mount reveals the Gospel of Our Lord as the fulfillment of the Mosaic Law. To follow the Messiah, all of his disciples are challenged daily to take the narrow path, to pray without ceasing, and to seek blessedness by living and serving just as Jesus did. Today's Gospel is the next chapter: Our Lord illustrates whom we must all serve, and how. He performs three miracles, two spectacular and one rather domestic. A man afflicted with leprosy approaches Him and asks to be clean. Lepers were the outcast of Jewish society, literally untouchable. Because nothing was known about the way one contracts the disease, they lived in squalor, apart from society. They had to go about shouting ""unclean"" so the healthy could keep their distance. But no one is outside the mercy of God. No one needed to keep distant from the Son of God. With a touch of His hand and a word from His lips, the Lord heals him instantly. A centurion, a Gentile representative of the Roman oppressor, comes. The scene is instantly recognizable, because every time we approach the communion rail we say what he said. His servant is afflicted with paralysis and is in great pain. Note the detail, missing in our English translation. The Greek and Latin are explicit: the servant is a pais, a puer, a boy slave. Imagining one of our eight or ten year old parishioners on that sick bed brings the poignancy of this scene to our mind's eye. A child is suffering. Who in the world does not feel empathy? Our Lord is moved. He offers to come and touch the lad. The centurion demurs. ""I am not worthy that Thou should enter under my roof. As a man who wields authority, I know how things work. I know that you can say only a word, and he will be healed."" Jesus sees His unusual faith, faith that is a pure gift of God. And a word of healing from the Word of God is enough to effect a miraculous cure. The third healing is recorded after our passage today. Entering Peter's house, the Lord sees Peter's mother in law lying sick, feverous. Remember, in a day before antibiotics, fevers often killed. Without a word, Jesus touches the woman and the fever disappeared. Now when a fever leaves most of us, we are listless and useless for the rest of the day. This woman's energy returned at once and she was able to perform her domestic work. Remember, when Jesus heals us, spirit, soul or body, He expects us to get back to our work of prayer and service. The healing can be by word only, by touch only, or by word and touch together. The miraculous hand of God was working through God's Son. The miraculous hand of God now works through our hands, which are His hands, and through our words, which are His. So let's now turn to the words of St. Paul to the Church at Rome. Rome, the center of the ancient world. Rome, the haughty conqueror to whom the whole Mediterranean culture paid homage and tribute. Rome, with its stratified society that kept the poor dependent on government handouts of bread and circuses. And, if we are to believe the ancient authors, it was Rome, a moral sewer headed by a debauched imperator whose very name is a four-letter word: Nero. How should Christians live as followers of Our Lord in the midst of such depravity?"
Mark 3:7-12,"('Heart', 'Economy', 'Changing Hearts')",Catholic," Thursday of Second Week in Course 2017 Joy of the Gospel Mark's Gospel, which tradition holds is the second one written after Matthew, seems to be a short life of Christ appended to an account of His passion and resurrection. Miracles such as the ones we hear about today occupy a large part of this Gospel. Jesus came to save us, spirit, soul and body. Even touching Christ caused power to come from Him, healing every part of the human person. Christ continues to heal today. That is, after all, why we are here-to hear the word of God and to let Him heal us, always in our spirits and minds, and even sometimes in our bodies. But Jesus doesn't just intend to heal individuals. He wants to heal communities and cultures. He wants our institutions, even our economic institutions, to be places of justice, love and peace. You may recall that the Holy Father, in the encyclical the Joy of the Gospel, which we have been meditating on for nearly three years, set about discussing our relationship with the poor. Now he wants to talk about healing economies, making them responsive to the needs of the poor. This may cause some to flinch a little, but the Pope is acting as a prophet here. The role of the prophet is twofold, ""to comfort the afflicted, and to afflict the too comfortable."" 'The need to resolve the structural causes of poverty cannot be delayed, not only for the pragmatic reason of its urgency for the good order of society, but because society needs to be cured of a sickness which is weakening and frustrating it, and which can only lead to new crises. Welfare projects, which meet certain urgent needs, should be considered merely temporary responses. As long as the problems of the poor are not radically resolved by rejecting the absolute autonomy of markets and financial speculation and by attacking the structural causes of inequality, no solution will be found for the world's problems or, for that matter, to any problems. Inequality is the root of social ills. 'The dignity of each human person and the pursuit of the common good are concerns which ought to shape all economic policies. At times, however, they seem to be a mere addendum imported from without in order to fill out a political discourse lacking in perspectives or plans for true and integral development. How many words prove irksome to this system! It is irksome when the question of ethics is raised, when global solidarity is invoked, when the distribution of goods is mentioned, when reference in made to protecting labor and defending the dignity of the powerless, when allusion is made to a God who demands a commitment to justice. At other times these issues are exploited by a rhetoric which cheapens them. Casual indifference in the face of such questions empties our lives and our words of all meaning. Business is a vocation, and a noble vocation, provided that those engaged in it see themselves challenged by a greater meaning in life; this will enable them truly to serve the common good by striving to increase the goods of this world and to make them more accessible to all."
Philippians 3:8-4:13,"('Peace', 'Past Failures', 'Accomplishments')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," I'm Pressing On Scriptures: Philippians 3:8-14; 4:13 We have entered into a new year that represents a year of change for our lives. This year represents the first year of the rest of our lives. This statement will make more sense shortly. The title of my message this morning is ""I'm Pressing On."" Each New Year brings on the excitement of new possibilities of what lies ahead. Each New Year also causes us to reflect on the opportunities and or possibilities that were unfulfilled in the previous year. It is those missed and unfulfilled opportunities and possibilities that lead many to establish New Year resolutions at the beginning of a new year. We want to make changes so that in the upcoming year we will not make the same decisions that led to how we finished the previous year. For some people they refuse to make New Year's resolutions because they always fail to complete them so their thinking is why try when they know they will fail. Everyone sitting under the sound of my voice has experienced some unfulfilled personal promises and missed opportunities at some point in your life. How we think about our ""failure"" with these unfulfilled personal promises or missed opportunities impact how we think about our future. For example, maybe you had planned to pray more only to discover that life kept you in the same habits from the previous year so this year your plan is to do ""the best you can"" without setting any specific goals. The impact of not hitting your goal last year stops you for setting a new goal and potentially failing this year. Maybe you had planned to lose weight last year only to find that you weigh a little bit more on December 31st than you did on January 1st 2016. So this year maybe your goal is not to gain any additional weight versus actually losing what you currently have. Again, the failure of the past impacts the goals of the future. If you have unfulfilled promises and missed opportunities from 2016 that you are thinking about in this New Year I want you to listen closely to this message for you are not alone. There are many people walking around in the daylight but living under the cloud of something from their past. It follows them wherever they go and it is always there. No matter how bright the ""Son"" is in our life this cloud cast its shadow of our past failures and disappointments and seem to always take away our ability to enjoy our present. All of us know someone who is ""living in the past"" and are operating based on protecting their future based on the past failures. While I am not a psychologist or psychiatrist I do know this, we have all failed and have come short of our goals. We have all been hurt and felt the need to protect ourselves moving forward. We have all done stupid things that if we could take them back and wipe the slate clean we would. We all have pasts that continue to influence our present and potentially our future. Mistakes and failures are a part of life, but at some point we have to start looking ahead and stop looking behind. We have to focus on where we are going versus where we left. This focus will require that we put some things behind us so that we can walk freely into our future. Turn with me to Philippians 3: 8-14."
James 1:2-4,"('Grace', 'Hope Endures', 'Joy And Meaning', 'Faith Alive')",Wesleyan," Biblical Joy (James 1:2-4; NKJV) ""My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, [3] knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. [4] But, let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing."" ? A certain elderly lady was well-known for her faith, and for her boldness in talking about it. At times, she would stand on her front porch and shout: ""PRAISE THE LORD!"" Next door to her lived an atheist who would get so angry at her proclamations he would shout: ""There ain't no God!"" Hard times set in on this Godly elderly lady, and she prayed for the Lord to send her some assistance. She stood on her porch and openly prayed: ""GOD I NEED FOOD! I AM HAVING A HARD TIME. PLEASE LORD, SEND ME SOME GROCERIES!"" The next morning the lady went out on her porch, and noted a large bag of groceries and shouted, ""PRAISE THE LORD!"" The neighbor jumped from behind a bush and said: ""A-ha! I told you there was no God. I bought those groceries, God didn't!"" The lady started jumping up and down and clapping her hands and said: ""PRAISE THE LORD! He not only sent me groceries, but He made the devil pay for them...Praise the Lord!"" ? For the ump-teenth time, Mrs. Youngston came to her pastor to tell him: ""I'm so scared! Joe says he's going to kill me if I continue to come to your Church."" ""Yes, yes,"" replied the pastor, more than a little tired of hearing this over and over. ""I shall continue to pray for you, Mrs. Youngston. Have faith - the Lord will watch over you."" ""O, yes, the Lord has kept me safe thus far; only..."" ""Only what...?"" ""Well, now he says if I keep coming to your Church, he's going to kill YOU!"" ""Well, now,"" said the pastor, ""perhaps it's time to check out that little Church on the other side of town."" Who doesn't like to laugh and cut-up once in a while? According to years of medical, emotional, and psychological studies, genuine, non-chemical influenced happiness and laughter is holistically good for us. But, we humans sometimes misunderstand and misinterpret the meaning of some words/phrases...joy is one of those. You see, joy - especially Biblical joy - is one of those words. Biblical joy is not entirely synonymous with happiness. Happiness relies completely emotion. Emotion is the authentication of happiness. The same way sadness is demonstrated by depression and tears. Joy has been accepted in our English language as an emotional demonstration often defined as happiness. Yet, Biblically, joy has a different connotation for the word joy. Unlike a fleeting moment of happiness or laughter; unlike the pleasure of a beautiful sight, unlike a close gathering of friends or loved ones, true, Biblical joy is given to us because of our relationship with the Lord. ? (Rom. 3:23) - ""...For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God..."" Yet... ?

"Psalms 116:1-4, Psalms 116:12-19","('Death', 'Resurrection', 'Salvation', 'Bodily Resurrection', 'I Love The Lord')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," FROM CRUSHING CONSTRICTIONS TO NEWNESS OF LIFE Psalm 116:1-4; Psalm 116:12-19 Have you ever had an experience where you felt as if the life was being crushed out of you, as surely as if a boa constrictor had its coils around you? This could be physical illness, or mental anguish; crushing circumstances, or financial restriction. All you can do at such times, or so it seems, is cry out to God! If I was asked why I love the LORD, I might well answer: because He heard and answered my prayer (Psalm 116:1). Yet this may, at first glance, appear self-serving: what would I have to say for myself if my prayers had not been answered in the way that I had hoped? Experience teaches us that there will be such times, but our love must rise above that: we should be like Job, who said, 'Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him' (Job 13:15). The response of the Psalmist to this question does not stop at what he has experienced: but moves through that to promise (Psalm 116:2), and celebration (Psalm 116:16-17). A testimony may well begin, ""I love the Lord because..."" (Psalm 116:1), or 'Truly God is good to Israel' (Psalm 73:1), but we must also colour in the circumstances which led to that conclusion. ""He inclined His ear"" (Psalm 116:2), yes: but how did that get to the point where I could pledge ever after that I ""will call upon His name"" (Psalm 116:17)? For the Psalmist, death itself came knocking at the door, constricting him in its cords: and inflicting such pain as to leave him face to face with the prospect of Sheol. In this experience, there seemed no window of hope: he could see only trouble and sorrow (Psalm 116:3). It was THEN that he called upon the name of the LORD: ""O LORD, I beseech You, deliver my soul"" or ""O LORD, I pray, save my life"" (Psalm 116:4). I see beyond these words of testimony the experience of Another, who made the impassioned plea: 'O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me'. Yet to this there came no audible answer. He knew within His holy heart what He must do, and conceded: 'Nevertheless, not my will, but yours be done' (Matthew 26:39). ""Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of"" His Faithful One (cf. Psalm 116:15) - and our death in Him (Romans 6:8). JESUS experienced death itself, and felt the pains of Sheol (Psalm 116:3) but - as with the Psalmist - THAT WAS NOT THE END. He later testified that the LORD had ""delivered His soul from death"" (Psalm 116:8), and therefore that He would ""walk before the LORD in the land of the living"" (Psalm 116:9). When we come through an experience like this, and come out the other end, our heart inclines to praise and thanksgiving. Because of what Jesus has done for me, in dying and taking away my sins - and for all His other 'gracious benefits' (cf. Psalm 103:2) - ""What shall I render to the LORD"" (Psalm 116:12)? I asked Him to save me (Psalm 116:4), and He saved me (Psalm 116:8). I must therefore grasp with both hands the salvation thus freely offered (Psalm 116:13). How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation (Hebrews 2:3)?"
1 Corinthians 2:6-16,"('Discernment', 'Worldly Wisdom', 'Wisdom From God', 'Truth Of God')",Baptist," HAVING THE MIND OF CHRIST 1 Corinthians 2:6-16 Online Sermon: http://www.mckeesfamily.com/?page_id=3567 In this passage, Paul writes to the church of Corinth to explain how to discern what was wisdom from God versus that of this world. There were many false teachers. Were the Roman philosophers and their plethora of many gods correct concerning Christ? Was He truly but one god amongst many whose teachings were primitive? Were the Guardians of the Jewish Law correct when they said that Christ was not the Messiah but was yet to come? Even inside of the church, which leader's teaching should they follow, after all many of them seemed to vary in their opinions? Being close to so many divergent points of view one cannot help but sympathize with a church left wondering how they could tell which one had the truth concerning Christ verses whom was a false teacher! Paul's statement that one can only discern truth through aid of the Spirit of God is profound and has reaching implications for today's society. CHURCH OF CORINTH ISSUES To interpret this passage correctly one must first understand some of the historical reasons why Paul wrote to the church at Corinth. Plagued with denominational politics, doctrinal disputes and liturgical preferences, one should not be surprised that this letter was addressed to the spiritual babies at the church of Corinth (3:1-2). Living in one of the most prosperous cities in the ancient world, one that prided itself on their lavish lifestyles and tolerance to new ideas, had a profound affect on church unity amongst those who embraced the divergent thoughts of both the Roman and Jewish cultures. Surrounded by numerous pagan religions meant that Christianity was constantly being challenged by the Roman philosophers of their age. To make matters worse factions formed that gave their allegiance either to Paul, Apollos, Cephas or perhaps Christ Himself. While the church of Corinth could boast that they were materially rich, they remained spiritually immature because they had given into the influences that did not know the truth concerning Jesus Christ. WISDOM CONTRASTED We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing. No, we declare God's wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began. 1 Corinthians 2:6-7, NIV Paul begins his argument concerning wisdom by pointing out the fact that there are two types of wisdom. First, there is a wisdom that only the mature speak. There is disagreement about what Paul meant by the term ""mature."" Some scholars believe mature means those Christians who are no longer babies in Christ (1 Corinthians 3:1) but instead have attained a higher level of spiritual maturity. Other scholars claim that since Paul does not talk about the babies of Christ until chapter three, he most likely is referring to any born-again believer. Either interpretation is possible but the ""we"" that begins this passage seems to favour the mature being Paul and the apostles. Paul later will explain in more detail this type of wisdom."
Luke 4:14-21,"('Jesus In Synagogue', 'Inaugural Address')",Independent/Bible," Many around the world are waiting for the inaugural address of the new incoming US president Donald Trump, this month. The ""inaugural address"" itself is a speech given during this ceremony which informs the people of the intentions as a leader. The opening remarks are significant, for this is the first formal public address as leader now in power, as to priorities, actions and aims. It is an Epiphany of sorts in unveiling who this person is. In Luke 4, in Jesus' first public address in the temple, he explained who He is and what He has come to do. Before this point, through the first thirty years of His life, Jesus had lived in obscurity in Nazareth. The only recorded incident from those silent years is His visit to Jerusalem and dialogue with the teachers in the temple when He was twelve. Apart from that, nothing is known about His childhood years except for the general statement that He ""kept increasing in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men"" (Luke 2:52). The next recorded event in Jesus' life was His appearance at the Jordan River to be baptized by John the Baptist. After His baptism Jesus, at the direction of the Holy Spirit, spent forty days in the wilderness being tempted by Satan. All that happened in His life up to this point in Luke's gospel--the testimony of Gabriel, the angels who appeared to the shepherds, Zacharias, Elizabeth, Mary, Joseph, Simeon, Anna, John the Baptist, Jesus' affirmation at age twelve that He was the Son of God, and His public attestation by the Father and the Holy Spirit at His baptism--had established His messianic credentials. The time had now come for Jesus to step onto the stage of His full public ministry. It is only in truly seeing Jesus for exactly who He is and what He came to do, we can see who we are and what we must do. In order to be rescued and to act as rescuers, we must clearly see the human condition, need and avenue for escape. If we are unclear about this condition or how to help others in this condition then the effect is tragic and eternal. But if we can see the link of Jesus' ministry to God's promises, His tender call and hope of deliverance, then we can be sure of the sinners deliverance and assurance of salvation. This introductory scene in Luke's account of Jesus' public ministry takes place in His hometown of Nazareth. His Inaugural Address in explaining who He is and what He came to do can be seen through: 1) The Area (Luke 4:14-15), and 2) The Announcement (Luke 4:16-21). 1) The Setting (Luke 4:14-15) Luke 4:14-15 14 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and a report about him went out through all the surrounding country. 15 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all. (ESV) Verses 14 and 15 are the entrance to a new section of portraits of Jesus in Luke's gospel. They introduce Jesus' ministry in Galilee, the northern part of Israel, which the Lord would be engaged in for about a year and a half. Between Luke 4:13 and 4:14, 15 there may well have been an interval of about a year, during which the events related in John 1:19-4:42 occurred. If so, the date when Jesus returned to Galilee, to begin his Great Galilean Ministry (Luke 4:14-9:17), was probably about December of the year A.D. 27 or a little later (Hendriksen, W., & Kistemaker, S. J. (1953-2001). Exposition of the Gospel According to Luke (Vol. 11, pp. 246-247). Grand Rapids: Baker Book House.)"
Psalms 1:1,"('Bad Influence', 'Wicked Counsellors', 'Choosing Friends')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Psalms 1:1 - UNFRIENDING ""Oh, the joys of those who do not follow the advice of the wicked, or stand around with sinners, or join in with mockers."" GO TO THAT PERSON'S PROFILE If David was on facebook he would have unfriended them. Brothers Abishai and Joab are as wicked as they come. King David battled with their dispositions as well as their actions. After Joab killed Abner, David said, ""And even though I am the anointed king, these two sons of Zeruiah--Joab and Abishai--are too strong for me to control. So may the Lord repay these evil men for their evil deeds."" (2 Samuel 3:39 NLT) When David speaks of the wicked (or ungodly), the sinners and the mockers in Psalm 1, was he thinking of unfriending Zeruiah's sons? Or was David talking about others who were following him? He regretted Saul following him, who tried to murder him on several occasions, and Amnon who raped his daughter, Tamar. Perhaps he was looking at Absalom's profile, his handsome, power hungry son who waited years to kill Amnon and then conspired on his timeline against David, causing a civil war? Is he talking about Ahithophel, his trusted follower and advisor who unfriended him by becoming a traitor? Perhaps he is talking about unfriending bullies like Goliath and other Philistine enemies who served false gods and threatened his life? Is David talking about Shimei who threw stones and abuse at David, or perhaps Sheba and Adonijah who rebelled against David's leadership? Or was he simply thinking of unfriending me or people with whom I keep company every day? People like us. Oh, maybe we have not killed or threatened to kill anyone, conspired to create war, abused or rebelled or expressed traitorous intent to anyone, but surprisingly, the wicked are not always those who commit outwardly sinful acts. They are not always outwardly immoral or evil, not just the mass murderers or those involved in bikie wars, terrorist bombings, stabbings, drive-by shootings or any overt criminal behavior. In the Bible, the wicked, sinners and mockers can be simply those who have unfriended God; forsaken God's counsel, advice, guidance, purposes, plans and desires. It refers to anyone, overtly criminal in behavior or not in our eyes, who has blocked and discarded the purposes for which they were created and thus live in opposition to any intervention of God into their lives. Forsaking God can lead us in many directions, and not simply those we consider as being outwardly wicked. Conversely, people we consider befriending because we consider having acceptable behavior may well be wicked in God's eyes. SELECT UNFRIEND ""Walking in the counsel of the Ungodly"" is following advice or guidance and making plans for our behavior in everyday life which is in keeping with those who have cut themselves off from God (un-Godly), those who have no inclination to follow, acknowledge or heed God's Word.

Psalms 90:1-17,"('Sin', 'Christian Life', 'Holiness And Life')",Baptist," ""Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations. Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever you had formed the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God. ""You return man to dust and say, 'Return, O children of man!' For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, or as a watch in the night. ""You sweep them away as with a flood; they are like a dream, like grass that is renewed in the morning: in the morning it flourishes and is renewed; in the evening it fades and withers. ""For we are brought to an end by your anger; by your wrath we are dismayed. You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence. ""For all our days pass away under your wrath; we bring our years to an end like a sigh. The years of our life are seventy, or even by reason of strength eighty; yet their span is but toil and trouble; they are soon gone, and we fly away. Who considers the power of your anger, and your wrath according to the fear of you? ""So, teach us to number our days that we may get a heart of wisdom. Return, O LORD! How long? Have pity on your servants! Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days. Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, and for as many years as we have seen evil. Let your work be shown to your servants, and your glorious power to their children. Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish the work of our hands upon us; yes, establish the work of our hands!"" [1] ""Teach us to number our days."" I turned seventy years of age this past week. ""Seventy"" is just a number by which one can count the years of his pilgrimage. Accomplishments, the fulfilment of dreams is not measured by the number of circuits around the sun. A life can be defined by a hyphen. One day, should Christ tarry, each individual listening to this message will draw his or her final breath. After that final breath, a granite slab or a bronze plaque, will likely be placed in some prominent place as a memorial to the individual's life; or perhaps it will be a line in a journal or an electronic entry on some data base. The plaque, or data entry, will have a date stating when that person began this life and a date stating when the last breath was drawn. Between these two dates will be a hyphen. Our days, and all that we did between the first and the last breath, will be reduced to a hyphen. We are experts at counting our days, but the challenge of the Psalm is for us to live our days in such a way that they count. This particular Psalm is often read at funerals. It is appropriate to do so since the minds of the mourners are open to thinking of the brevity of life at such times. Listening to the Psalm, hearers are compelled to think of the impact we may have during the few days we live on this earth. This is a Psalm written by Moses--not someone we normally associate with the writing of the Psalms. It appears it was written near the end of his days, a time when he reflected on the brevity of life and weighed how to make the days count."
"Genesis 1:26-27:28, Revelation 12:10-11:15","('Freedom', 'Manager')",Pentecostal," And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the Accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them day and night. Revelation12:10 I so much thank God for the power of his Christ, which he hath sent to rescue man from the hand of strong accusers. Through the years of my researched, I've fine out that man had been created by God to enjoy divine relationship and freedom of life without measure. And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them Genesis1:26-27. God created them not to live their life as all other he hath created, but to be the head OVER them all.

Mark 8:27-33,"('Messiah', 'Christ', 'Confession', 'Heresy')",Baptist," Getting it Right and Wrong Mark 8:27-33 Rev. Brian Bill January 7-8, 2017 Man on Street Interview There are a lot of opinions about who Jesus is, aren't there? The question about His identity is extremely important...and how you answer it will determine where you spend eternity. I'm pumped to be back in the Gospel of Mark. This is our 48th sermon in our ""Servant and Savior"" series and we're only about half way through this glorious gospel! Our passage today serves as a turning point in the book. The first eight chapters help us see Jesus as Servant and now the emphasis changes to Jesus as the Savior. In the first half we saw Jesus crisscrossing the Sea of Galilee and from here on out we'll see Him on the way to Jerusalem and the Cross. We left off with Jesus healing the blind man in Bethsaida and now He aims to open the blind eyes of His disciples so that they can see who He is and what He came to do. Let's read Mark 8:27-33 together: ""And Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the way he asked his disciples, 'Who do people say that I am?' And they told him, 'John the Baptist; and others say, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.' And he asked them, 'But who do you say that I am?' Peter answered him, 'You are the Christ.' And he strictly charged them to tell no one about him. And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again. And he said this plainly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. But turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, 'Get behind me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.'"" Our outline is simple. "" Who do people say Jesus is? (27-28) "" Who do you say Jesus is? (29-30) "" Who does Jesus say He is? (31-33) 1. Who do people say Jesus is? We see in the first part of verse 27 that Jesus heads about 25 miles north with his disciples: ""And Jesus went on with His disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi..."" This area is the region known as Dan in the Old Testament and marked the northern boundary of Israel, near Syria today. BTW, when you hear the phrase, ""from Dan to Beersheba,"" it's a way to say from the furthest point north to the furthest point south. This was a remote region where the team could get away from the large crowds and religious leaders. This would allow Jesus to do some uninterrupted teaching with his disciples. Jesus wants them to grasp two primary truths: "" His Person - who He is "" His Plan - what He came to do ""Caesarea"" was named after Caesar and ""Philippi"" was named for Philip, the son of Herod. This distinguishes it from another city called Caesarea on the Mediterranean. This region was the center of Baal worship in the Old Testament and then became the religious center for the worship of the Greek god Pan. The Roman emperor was also worshipped in a temple there. Citizens were required to enter this temple once a year, place some incense on a burning altar and proclaim, ""Caesar is Lord!"" In addition, there were shrines to various gods carved into the cliffs."
Psalms 34:1-17,"('Faith', 'Grace', 'God Is Good')",Christian Church," GOD IS GOOD PSALM 34:1-9 ""I WILL BLESS THE LORD AT ALL TIMES: HIS PRAISE SHALL CONTINUALLY BE IN MY MOUTH."" Do we ever praise the Lord enough or give thanks too much? Is there ever a limit to our praise and thanks? No, never. Thanksgiving to God should be a never ending practice in our lives. LL.- When Robinson Crusoe was wrecked on his lonely isle, he drew up in two columns what he called the evil and the good, as follows: - He was cast on a desolate island, but still alive--not drowned, as all his ship's company were. - He was divided from mankind and banished from human society, but he was not starving. - He had no clothes, but he was in a hot climate where he didn't need them. - He was without means of defense, but he saw no wild beasts, such as he had seen on the coast of Africa. - He had no soul to speak to, but God had sent the ship so near to the shore that he could get of it all things for his needs. So he concluded that there was not any condition in the world so miserable but there was something positive to be thankful for in it. What about you? Do you only see the negative things in your life? Can you not find the positive things in your life for which to give thanks and praise to the Lord? 1- The Lord has answered my prayers (4) 2- The Lord saved me from my troubles (6) 3- The Lord blessed me with good (7-10) "" We are going praise the Lord. We are brag on the Lord. . Don't get mad....might as well get used to it. 2 MY SOUL SHALL MAKE HER BOAST IN THE LORD: THE HUMBLE SHALL HEAR THEREOF, AND BE GLAD. "" My soul has to boast in the lord. I've got to speak good of his name. "" Sometimes people hear us talking about our life's and people think we are boasting about ourselves. -- NO, we are boasting on what God is doing in us. "" The work that has happen in this church....all the things that have been done -- This thing is not done by the ingenuity of man - but by the hand of the Lord. "" My boasting is not in ourselves. We are not here to impress each other. Our boasting is in the Lord. I am going to brag on him....we are not going to stop. "" The humble will hear and praise, but the proud, the dignified, so much your petrified, you won't praise the Lord. You don't want to hear about it... 3 O MAGNIFY THE LORD WITH ME, AND LET US EXALT HIS NAME TOGETHER. "" OH, don't take the O out of the bible. You ever watch a hockey team score? OH, he scores "" Notice this bragging thing is a team effort. It is not just me up here - David says, come on now, Oh magnify the Lord with me. "" Isn't that what we came to do. Isn't that what adoring him and worshipping him is all about. "" We filed in here this today to magnify his name TOGETHER 3 4 I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears. You meet your fears with your faith "" YOU KNOW WHY THE LORD IS GOOD? - HE DELIVERS YOU FROM YOU FEARS. 6 THIS POOR MAN CRIED, AND THE LORD HEARD HIM, AND SAVED HIM OUT OF ALL HIS TROUBLES. "" What kind of troubles does a poor man have? Poor man troubles. "" I have seen it over and over. People's life's get better serving the lord and putting their faith in our Good God. The righteous have never been forsaken."
Hebrews 12:15,"('Bitterness', 'Forget', 'Bitter Root', 'Bitter Resentful', 'Envy And Greed')",Pentecostal," Bitterness is known in the Bible as spiritual poison and a means by which many are defiled (Hebrews 12:15). It is the source of countless spiritual and physical problems in millions of lives today. The Bible tells us that MANY are defiled by the means of bitterness. Bitterness can be tricky to recognize because it's not a symptom or visible on the surface like anger usually is. Many claim that they aren't an angry or hateful person, but that's not what bitterness is all about. Bitterness is an underlying problem that doesn't always manifest on the outside, but dwells in that person's system. BITTERNESS IS A ROOT! Hebrews 12:15, ""Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled."" What is a root? A root is a source, or a bubbling fountain that is laying under the surface. Roots do not directly manifest or make themselves known, but are a source of nutrition or fuel for other elements that are on the surface. You don't usually see a plant showing off it's root system, but if the plant didn't have a root system it wouldn't survive. A root's job is not to manifest on the surface, but to brew under the surface and fuel things that are on the surface. Let's take a closer look at a plants root system... where does the roots dwell? Under the surface of the soil. Can everybody see it's root system? No, because it's hidden under the soil or surface. The same is true with bitterness in a person's soul. It is a hidden element that lies under the surface, and out of it springs up anger and other negative emotions against others and against the circumstances around us. People who have a root of bitterness find it easy to get upset over things that other's are doing around them. It's like a brewing fountain that lies beneath the surface, waiting to fuel something that is on the surface. BITTERNESS CAN BE KEPT TO ONE'S SELF Countless women who are raped develop awful emotional and spiritual bondage. It's not because they were raped, but because they allowed the trauma to get to them. Many women are in bondage today because they became bitter under the surface about what was done to them years ago. I believe Clinton Clark once said that from his observation, it seemed that boys who are molested by older men and forgave the molester and forgot about it right away, walked away without picking up unclean homosexual spirits, but those who allowed the trauma to bother them walked away with homosexual spirits and other bondages. That's how the demonic spirits gain access into a person's life through rape and abuse. It's not the abuse or rape, but the bitterness and unhealthy feelings that build up within a person who has been taken advantage of. Demons thrive on bitterness and unforgiveness, and it's a wide open door for them to move right in on a person and develop many spiritual, mental and even physical bondages. Now many of these people who have been hurt, don't express it on the outside, but rather hold the hurt and bitter feelings inside where they fester and grow. I know women who have been raped, and they are kind and gentle and loving people, but inside they are bound up because of what was done to them many years ago. Just because they aren't angry or outrageous individuals, does not mean they are free from the root of bitterness. As I said earlier, bitterness is a root, and roots are not always visible on the surface. They may promote ungodly anger and other emotions on the surface but bitterness itself works under the surface."
Revelation 6:3-4,"('Beast Of Revelation', 'Red Horse', 'Second Seal', 'Second Beast', 'A Great Sword')",Baptist," Second Seal: the Red Horse and Its Rider Commentary on the Book of Revelation By: Tom Lowe Date: 9-9-15 TOPIC # III: VISIONS OF JUDGMENT AGAINST JERUSALEM (4:1-11:19) Subtopic B: The Opening of Seven Seals (6.1-8.1) Lesson: III.B.2: Second Seal: the Red Horse and Its Rider (Revelation 6:3-4) Revelation 6:3-4 (KJV) 3 And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see. 4 And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword. Introduction In this short passage, John records the opening of the second seal; and as the seal was opened, one of the four living beasts summoned a rider on a red horse (""Come and see""). In other words, events take place on earth because of the sovereign direction of God in heaven. The horse imagery is probably related to the vision described in Zechariah 1:7-17. Horses represent God's activity on earth, the forces He uses to accomplish His divine purposes. The center of His program is Israel, particularly the city of Jerusalem (Jerusalem is mentioned 39 times in Zechariah). God has a covenant purpose for Israel and that purpose will be fulfilled just as He promised. Commentary 3 And when he had opened the second, I heard the second beast say, Come and see. Here we have the second act of John's vision which he describes in detail. Jesus, the Lamb, breaks the second seal on the scroll, as he had the first; the process was the same. ""And when he had opened the second seal,"" John said, ""I heard the second beast say, 'Come and see,'"" which was like the invitation given to the first rider, who came on a white horse. ""And there went out another horse that was red"" (blood-red in v. 3), and he was given a special power--""and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another. In other words, he was granted the power to remove the peace that is on the earth. Since God is sovereign over all things, it is He who grants the permission. The imagery here is not that this horseman does the butchering, but that he removes peace, and without that peace, humans butcher each other. Next, the apostle says, ""And there was given unto him a great sword."" The ""great sword"" is representative of the machines of war being unleashed on the earth by people left to their own devices without any divine intervention. The Greek word for ""sword"" here is different from the sharp two-aged sword of Revelation 1:16: ""And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword . . ."" This sword probably would have been about 5 feet long and would have weighed about twenty-five pounds. Strong warriors would swing it while on horseback to kill foot soldiers."
Matthew 3:13-17,"(""Jesus' Baptism"", 'Our Baptism')",Lutheran," When U.S. astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first person to place a boot onto the moon's surface, he intoned: ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."" Armstrong meant of course that the distance from the bottom rung of the lunar lander to the moon's surface was not far--nothing but a small step. But for Armstrong to be in such a position to be able to step onto the moon meant a giant leap in mankind's technological ability. That mission to the moon had involved 400,000 engineers, technicians, and scientists from 20,000 companies and the military at a cost of $150 billion dollars in today's money. Did you know that we too have benefitted from that 1969 mission to the moon? Technology invented for the lunar mission has found its way into our lives--things like better shock absorbers for shoes, cordless drills, miniature heart monitors and a dozen other inventions. Armstrong's moon-landing pronouncement, therefore, was not overstated. About two thousand years before Armstrong stepped onto the moon, another man took a small step which resulted in an even greater leap for mankind. When Jesus waded into the Jordan River to be baptized both he and we were forever changed. Let's find out how Jesus' baptism was one small step for the Man-God, and one giant leap for mankind. Jesus was 30 years old when he came to the Jordan River to be baptized by his cousin John. But when he made his request, John objected: ""I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"" (Matthew 3:14) Jesus' desire for baptism was as strange as if I would ask you to bleach a white t-shirt I had just bought. ""But it's already snow white!"" you would protest. And so was Jesus. Not a speck of sin clung to him. Why did he need baptism? John's objection highlights the truth that baptism is not just a mere ceremony; it does something. It washes away sin in accordance with God's promise. So why would Jesus, the sinless Son of God, request baptism? Jesus acknowledged John's objection but stated: ""Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness"" (Matthew 3:15). What did Jesus mean that his baptism would ""fulfill all righteousness""? It can't mean that Jesus wanted to be baptized because this was another item on his to-do list from the heavenly Father. If so, John would have praised Jesus for desiring baptism. Like Jesus we don't seek baptism simply because this is what God has told us to do. He has of course, but not to test our faithfulness, instead to assure us of his faithfulness. Baptism is not what we do for God; it's what God does for us. Why then would we want to reject or even put off receiving the blessings of baptism? People will do that, however, when they don't know what the blessings of baptism are. So let's get back to our text so I can show you how Jesus' one small step into the Jordan River was indeed a giant leap for mankind."
Psalms 115:14-15,"('Holy Spirit', 'Increase', 'Destiny', 'Adversaries')",Charismatic," I. The Master Plan of Destiny Psalm 115:14-15 The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children. Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth. Jeremiah 29:11 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Genesis 1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. II. The Challenge 1 Corinthians 16:9 ""For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries."" When God is about to do significant things for you or through you, you'll face significant opposition. Every door that God will open for you won't come that easy; it will bring an avalanche of spiritual attack with it. The more effectual the door, the greater the opposition. When you experience great adversity, know for sure that a great door is about to break open. Don't be naïve. You'd think that, after pursuing, seeking, knocking and breaking open the door, its opening will eventually mark your rest. No! God will open great doors, but watch out, for there will be many adversaries. You'll have more enemies when things are working out for you than when they weren't. There will be many times you will actually wonder if you weren't better off without the open door. It's as if, as the door opens, the adversaries were trapped on the other side of the door, as anxious to come out as you are to enter in. Friction - and heat - inevitably ensues. Be prepared for the opening of the door you've been desiring. You'll not walk into it smoothly. You will be opposed. It's not a sign to retreat. It's a road sign, telling you you're on the right track. With the great door, will be much opposition. In fact, that's one reason why God sometimes delays the opening of doors we're knocking on; we may not be ready for the adversaries and opposition accompanied with it. Expect doors to open, but walk in, gun in hand, ready to shoot, because the room is occupied. You'll need to drive the occupants out before you enjoy the room. You are the glory of my strength: and in Your favour my horn shall be exalted. III. Case Study "" Nehemiah (Nehemiah 6:1-14) "" Paul Acts (23:12-35) "" Peter (Acts 12: 1-6) IV.

"Matthew 18:2-5, Matthew 19:13-15","('Follower Of Jesus', 'Disciple', 'Disciple Maker')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," The Way of Jesus #1 - ""I have begun following Jesus, and am depending on the Spirit of Jesus in my journey"". - January 8, 2017 It's the new year, still, but I don't want to talk about New Year's resolutions. I don't want to talk about the effort involved in adjusting our lifestyle, changing bad habits, focussing on fixing ourselves. I don't want to talk about any of that stuff because personally, I have found that it almost never works. I guess you could say I've been around long enough to know the limitations of my own self-discipline and my own determination. Rather, today I'm looking for us to share in an adventure. It's an adventure that takes the focus off ourselves. It takes the focus off of ourselves and onto God and God's kingdom. Off of thinking about ourselves so much and onto focussing on the well-being of others. I've come to the conclusion that when we live in our own heads, when we put our energies toward trying to make ourselves happier, we never achieve that goal. When we make the choice to not live in our own heads and instead focus on caring for others, that's when our own lives start to come together. Personal happiness never comes from seeking personal happiness. Joy, which is much deeper than happiness, comes from living for God and living to be a blessing to others. So what I want to talk about today is the first message of what is going to be a seven-part series on the Way of Jesus. On Wednesday, February 15 in this space those who are interested will gather at 6 pm for an introduction to the actual Way of Jesus platform, but over these next weeks we will look in some depth at the 7 markers of the Way of Jesus. Those 7 markers are: 1. I have begun to follow Jesus, and am depending on the Spirit of Jesus in my journey. 2. I am being sent by Jesus to bless others and invite them to follow Him. 3. I am learning to be like Jesus in my attitudes, behaviours, character. 4. I am learning to love God and to love others. 5. I am learning the teachings of Jesus. 6. I am helping someone and someone is helping me to be a growing follower of Jesus. 7. I am participating in a community of followers of Jesus on mission to the world. What I have experienced in my life is that transformation, real positive change, comes through following the way of Jesus, aligning ourselves with His will and His ways. The way of Jesus is God's way for us to lead the best possible lives. Today we are looking at the first marker of the Way of Jesus platform. It is about beginnings and it is about dependency. It's also about honesty and humility. 1) ""I have begun following Jesus, and am depending on the Spirit of Jesus in my journey"". It makes sense that the first marker is one of beginnings, and one that recognizes the person of the Holy Spirit in the beginning. The Holy Spirit is always around for good beginnings. The first book in the Bible, Genesis chapter 1 says, ""In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2 Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters""."
Psalms 138:8,"('Purpose', 'God Brings Purpose', 'Talents')",Assembly Of God," WHY DID GOD PUT ME ON PLANET EARTH? Ps. 138:8, TLB. INTRODUCTION A. HUMOR 1. There were three guys who wanted to be in the Olympics, but didn't know how to enter. So they went to the gate of the Olympic Village to see how other athletes got in. 2. Soon a big, hulking guy walked up with bulging biceps carrying a large steel ball and said to the guards: ""I'm Angus McPherson. Scotland. Shot-put."" The security team waved him right through. 3. The three guys said, ""Cool. We can do this."" The first one went to the hardware store, bought a long closet clothes-rod, put on a gym suit and went up to the guards: ""Chuck Wagon. Canada. Javelin."" The guards looked at his ""javelin"" and waved him in. 4. The second put on a gym suit and pried up a small manhole cover, and marched up to the front gate: ""Dusty Rhodes, Australia. Discus."" Welcome to the Olympics, Mr. Rhodes. 5. So the 2 guys waited inside for the 3rd guy. A couple of minutes later, the 3rd guy walked up to the front gate with a huge roll of barbed wire painfully tucked under his arm. 6. ""Who are you?"" the guards asked. ""Foster Bean,"" he says. ""Vermont, USA. Fencing."" 7. Like these guys, a lot of people don't know what they're here for! B. THESIS A common question is... 1. ""Why am I here?"" ""Do I really matter?"" In our culture, there are those who don't believe we're created with any inherent potential. 2 If you go around and ask people these questions, you'll get a lot of different answers. As to your purpose, Oprah Winfrey said, ""Look inside yourself for the answer."" 3. The Materialist would say, ""Life is all about the acquisition of things."" Those who are into self-help would say, ""You've got to create your own purpose."" 4. Carl Jung, the famous psychiatrist said, ""I don't know the meaning of life...but it looks as if something were meant by it."" How profound! 5. THESIS: We're going to look this morning at what the Bible says about our purpose, the value of having a purpose, and what God says we're supposed to be doing as believers. 6. The title of this message is ""Why Did God Put Me On Planet Earth?"" I. DO WE HAVE A PURPOSE OR NOT? A. NOT HAVING A PURPOSE IS BAD 1. DEATH PREFERRED TO NO PURPOSE a. Rick Warren tells a story from World War II where the Nazis forced prisoners to take all this rubble from a blown-up factory, and move it from Point A to Point B. b. The next day, they'd take the same wheelbarrows and put all the debris and bricks back at Point A. On Wednesday, back across the street to Point B. Back and forth, day after day. c. They were just keeping the prisoners busy, wearing them out, breaking their will. And some of the inmates, with no purpose in life, just being mocked by the Germans for the emptiness of what they had to do, got suicidal. d. Some of them actually tried to simply jump in front of the Gestapo guards, wanting to get shot. To live a life without purpose, without significance, was worse than death. 2. The most well-known shake-the-fist-at-heaven atheists out there have admitted: ""If there isn't a God, our lives really have no purpose."""
1 Corinthians 12:4-11,"('Healing', 'Salvation', 'Tongues', 'Healing In Faith', 'Holy  Spirit')",Pentecostal," I Corinthians 12:4 ""Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit."" ""Diversities"", here, means distinction, variety, difference. Then, this is saying, there are many different gifts, but all gifts come by the same Spirit. James 1:17 ""Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning."" The differences in the gifts are as wide as the people receiving the gifts. I Corinthians 12:5 ""And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord."" This, on the basis of an individual, means that a person administers the gift God has given them in his own unique way. I believe this goes even further than individuals and is speaking of different denominations, who might not cross every T and dot every I the way another denomination does, but is still administering the gifts the Holy Spirit has given them to the best of their ability. One may call themselves Methodist and another call themselves Baptist, but they are serving the same Lord. I could have used any other protestant church, but everyone is very familiar with these two. No harm was intended. I Corinthians 12:6 ""And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all."" I always say, it is alright to be a Baptist, if you are a Christian Baptist, not a Baptist Christian. Or a Methodist, or an Assembly of God, or a Pentecostal, etc. We are all worshipping the same God. We may be taking a little different route to get to heaven, but we all have the same destination. Read the 4th chapter of Ephesians to understand better. Why do we Christians fight each other about denomination, when we should be banning together fighting the atheist and those who do not look to Jesus as their Saviour? I Corinthians 12:7 ""But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal."" It is not for God's profit for us to have the gifts of the Spirit. It is to help us be more effective ministers. How would you like to build a house without a hammer? The gifts of the Spirit are the tools that we build with. They are our very present help. Manifestation is something that is made real. The world cannot see God with their physical eyes. They see the followers of Jesus. We must be so full of the Lord Jesus that when they look at us, they will not see us, but will see Christ in us. A very good friend of mine explains Jesus in us, this way. He says, we are the glove, and Jesus is the Hand in the glove. We Christians are actually a kingdom in exile. Our King is in exile, as well. He is Jesus Christ. We will be in exile, until Jesus comes back to this earth and sets up His Kingdom. He is King of kings and Lord of lords. We are better workers, if we have the Holy Spirit inside of us guiding us and teaching us as we minister. I Corinthians 12:8 ""For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;"" ""Wisdom"" is an understanding that is a gift from God. ""Knowledge"" is accumulated learning. In this case, there would be a supernatural"
Psalms 37:23-24,"(""God's Guidance"", 'Lead Us Not', 'Direction Of Life')",Pentecostal," Psalms 37:23 ""The steps of a [good] man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way."" The good man has decided to walk in the path the Lord has set for him. The good man makes Jesus not only his Saviour, but his Lord, as well. Each day the good man says, Lord, what would you have me to do today. The Lord is pleased with him, because he is obedient. I Samuel 15:22 ""And Samuel said, Hath the LORD [as great] delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey [is] better than sacrifice, [and] to hearken than the fat of rams."" When we do it God's way, we can not fail. Psalms 37:24 ""Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth [him with] his hand."" A righteous man may fall for a moment, but he has an advocate with the Father. I John 2:1 ""My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:"" This does not mean that the child of God can go back into a sinful way of life. It does mean that you may make a mistake, and Jesus will lift you back up. The secret is what is going on in your heart. Do you have the desire in your heart to sin, or do you have the desire in your heart to please God? Troubles come to all of us. We may not always be on the mountain top. Remember, we discussed that we learn more in the valley than we do on the mountain top. Troubles come to make us strong. The more times we face a difficult task and not fail in that trial, the more near like Jesus we are."
Genesis 3:6-6:7,"('Sin', 'Vision', 'Power From On High', 'Fall Of Man')",Assembly Of God,enesis 3:6," Check your Vision Coulee Community Church January 8th, 2017 Opening Illustration A few months after we moved here, they started to tear up Dewey Street right out here in front of the church. First they tore it down to the foundation. Then they came through and updated some of the sewer and water lines. I remember one morning when Tammie was visiting in Kenosha, I woke up to take a shower, and there was no water. I tried a few different faucets and nothing. I looked out the front window and saw them digging in the middle of the street, and fresh water pipe on the curb and figured they were changing out the mains. A few hours later, I heard the gurgling start in the pipes and went and turned on the kitchen faucet. Muddy, black goo came flying out the faucet, and then it shut off- the filter had clogged almost immediately. I took apart the faucet and cleaned the filter, and turned the water back on. The water was thick with sludge, sand, and just smelled awful. I spent the next several hours emptying the hot water heater, flushing it out, and running water through our system until everything was clear. Fortunately, I had set up my coffee the night before...otherwise I'd have been very cranky. ""Hypo-caffeine-imia"" It's amazing how much it shakes you when something you take for granted as reliable goes bad. Under normal conditions, we can talk into the bathroom or kitchen in the middle of the night and get a nice clean cold drink of water and never have to look at it. But for days after this event, I always ran the water for a few moments, ran it into a clear glass to examine it, and then if it was clear, I'd drink it. When something is as reliable as our water, or our electric power, we forget it's even there, or what it takes to deliver these modern conveniences to our homes. Adam and Eve ran into a similar problem in the Garden of Eden- their source had always been God. God was reliable, He was constant, and HE was always good to them. In fact, God was the source- period. There was nothing else. But then an enemy came into the picture, and enemy that was bent on polluting God's goodness in their lives. Today, we are going to look at what happened in the beginning as told to us in scripture. Specifically, we will look at the seminal moment when Lucifer, also known as satan, tempts our ancestor Eve, and her immediate reaction to it. Genesis 3:6-7 6 When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. 7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves. Prayer Proposition- There are 100 different ways to faithfully preach from this scripture. I'm going to focus in on one single truth that we find here because it's the basis for the rest of the truth we find in scripture. This basic truth is something we all need to understand about our very nature-"

It was written back in the 1940s by a popular folk singer named Woody Guthrie and has been sung by various quartets and choirs ever since. The reason we played it this morning is because it was inspired by the text we're reading this morning. Turn with me to Ezekiel 10:1-5 and follow along as I read. TEXT: Ezekiel 10:1-5 OPENING PRAYER I love preaching. Over the years I've found that the Bible is like a tapestry, its themes and stories are so interwoven and intricate, that if you pay close attention you can see the patterns and imagery that would simply amaze you. ILLUS: Have you ever seen a tapestry being made? As you watch, you find the artist adds one layer of thread after another and as you watch the patterns begin to unfold before you. You're not sure how the worker of the threads does this, but it is amazing because of how intricately the thread works itself into that pattern. And before you know it, a beautiful wall hanging has appeared out of nothing. That's how it is with Scripture. The interwoven nature of what God has done is amazing. Once you see the patterns develop you realize how masterful the plan had been. And that's exactly how I felt as studied the texts for this morning. In this sermon series we're dealing with sounds from the Bible And the sound we're focusing on today is described in Ezekiel 10:5 ""the sound of the wings of the cherubim... like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks."" Now many people, when they hear the word ""Cherub"" think of cute harmless little children with tiny wings on their backs (we showed such a picture on the overhead). Let me perfectly clear here... Cherubs are not ""cute"", they're not little, and they're not harmless. They've very powerful and they're very intimidating angels. You don't want to mess with them. Here in Ezekiel 10 we have one of those confusing visions in Scripture where God painted a very specific picture for the Jews. The picture - He was ticked. And He'd been ticked with them for several decades now. Judah had been sinning for years, committing idolatry and shedding of innocent blood, and finally God had had... enough. In the vision, God orders fire to be taken from among the cherubim and scattered all over the city in punishment of their sins. And later in Ezekiel 11 - the Shekinah Glory departs from the City. Now Cherubim seem to be everywhere in this vision. In fact, I think they're mentioned more in these chapters in Ezekiel than anyplace else in Scripture. And although we're not told much about them, it's obvious they are scary beings. I mean - even the sound of their wings is scary. The sound was almost like the voice of God Himself. The sound of the wings of these angels... was like the sound of judgment! Let me repeat: Cherubs are powerful and intimidating. You don't mess with them. They're such powerful creatures, that it's little wonder that people try to worship angels. Years ago, in a TV interview, one woman said: ""I pray to my angel all the time""."
Jeremiah 1:5,"('Children', 'Murder', 'Abortion', 'Pray')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Are you important? Are you children important? Are children everywhere important? How about those children still in the womb? Are they important? The word tells us that God knew us even before we were born. I don't think the God of the universe would take time to know someone unless that person was important. So yes, you are important and so are all the born and unborn children in the world. Every life is important to God and of equal value to Him. Rich, poor, tall, short, dark or light! Life begins at conception. Let's call it as it is; Abortion is murder. I know this is not politically correct to say it like that, but as Christians, we need to say it as God sees it. January 22 marks 44 years of legalized abortion in all fifty states at any time for any reason throughout pregnancy. In Just 11 more days we will remember the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision. Since that time, there have been approximately 58,586,256 abortions that have destroyed the lives of unborn children in the US alone. That's an increase of 821,547 from last year. Let's compare that to World War II which was the deadliest military conflict in history in absolute terms of total dead. Over 60 million people were killed, which was about 3% of the 1940 world population (est. 2.3 billion[2]). I am not talking about the Holocaust victims which were about 6 million Jewish people who died in the hands of the Nazis, but the total people killed in the conflict. If we isolate the Holocaust victims, the comparison of Abortions just in the US alone would tower over these grim statistics. Some scholars maintain that the definition of the Holocaust should also include the other victims persecuted and killed by the Nazis. Victims that included catholic clergy, Jehovah's witnesses, Christian missionaries and pastors, the handicapped, and homosexuals. Estimates of the death toll of non-Jewish victims vary by millions, partly because the boundary between death by persecution and death by starvation and other means in a context of total war is unclear.Using this definition, the total number of Holocaust victims is between 11 million and 17 million people. Still, in the US alone, we have killed almost 60 million unborn babies in the name of Abortion. In the USA, where nearly half of pregnancies are unintended and four in 10 of these are terminated by abortion, there are over 3,000 abortions per day. Twenty-two percent of all pregnancies in the USA (excluding miscarriages) end in abortion. For those who like to understand the magnitude of this human massacre, this represents one unborn baby murdered every 28.8 seconds in the USA. And the numbers are even more staggering when you look at the total estimated babies killed by abortion worldwide. It is calculated that 125,000 unborn babies are being killed every day in the world which means that every 0.69 seconds, an unborn baby is being killed. We need to do something about this and it starts with prayer. Please support 40 days for life at www.40daysforlife.com We need to be praying that the laws of this land would be changed, soon!"
"Joshua 6:1-5, Joshua 6:14-21","('Overcome', 'Overcomer', 'Conqueror')",Charismatic," CONQUER YOUR NEW YEAR om n oorwinner te wees in hierdie nuwe jaar So we are in 2017, a New Year, how many of you have started by saying this year I am going to lose weight, go on a diet. Or I am going to stop my bad habit. Question: have you started? It is natural for us to look back over last year and think what did we accomplish in our lives, work, personal and hopefully spiritual? How much time did I spend in God's word? How consistent was I in my prayer life? Did I go to church, to worship? Did my testimony help bring anyone to Jesus? Did I achieve all I set out to do? So I ask you all how was your spiritual life last year, was it up to standard. Let us reflect, consider this: what did you see God do? Where you a conqueror (oorwinner) of your life in 2016? I saw Him restore broken people I saw people being saved I saw hope being reborn and the transformation of many lives I saw God do some things in me and through me and around me, DID YOU? Now I am not saying that there is a problem with New Year resolutions (if you keep them) or a problem that you were not a conqueror last year, maybe just maybe we need to chance, to face today instead of looking back. In Isaiah 43:18-19 The Lord says "" Do not remember the past events, pay no attention to the things of old, Look I am about to do something new, even now it is coming, do you not see it? We need to have a clear view of the year ahead, as it says in James 4:14 We do not know what tomorrow will bring - what your life will be. We hear a lot at the moment, that we are living in the end times that Jesus is coming soon, that the end of the world is near. Should we not be living as John the Baptist announcing Jesus as the Messiah who is coming? John's purpose in life was to introduce the world to the Lamb of God and baptized people in the name of Jesus. John's life statement was recorded in John 3:30 He must increase, but I must decrease. So easy to say and how difficult to live, what does your life statement about your life, now it does not matter what you are, you could be a pastor, a housewife, a lawyer, a motor mechanic, a lazy person, a workaholic; whatever you do or wherever you are headed, YOUR LIFE MAKES A STATEMENT TO THE WORLD however God in His perfect wisdom gave us the choice, allows us to choose the course our life will take. We can choose life, death, right or wrong, good or evil, God or not. But has your choice allowed you to be a conqueror of your life? Does it include Jesus? What does it reveal? Does it show your reason for living? Turn with me to JOSHUA 6:1-5 Jericho was bolted and barred shut because the people were afraid of the Israelites. No one could enter or leave. The LORD said to Joshua, ""I am about to hand Jericho, its king, and its warriors over to you. All the soldiers will march around the city once a day for six days. Seven priests will carry rams' horns ahead of the ark. But on the seventh day you must march around the city seven times while the priests blow their horns. When you hear a long blast on the horn, all the troops must shout very loudly. The wall around the city will collapse. Then the troops must charge straight ahead into the city."""
Mark 2:7-11,"('Unforgiveness', 'Past Fear', 'Bitter Resentful', 'Hurting Hearts')",Pentecostal," BITTERNESS and UNFORGIVNESS Mark 2:7-11 (Wey) ""Why does this man use such words?"" they said; ""He is blaspheming. Who can pardon sins but One--that is, God?""... Jesus asked them, ""Which is easier?--to say to this paralytic, 'Your sins are pardoned,' or to say, 'Rise, take up your mat, and walk?' But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to pardon sins""--He turned to the paralytic, and said, ""To you I say, 'Rise, take up your mat and go home.'"" Conditional Forgiveness Mat 6:12 (TEB) ""Forgive us the wrongs that we have done, as we forgive the wrongs others have done us."" Luke 6:37 (NIV) ""...Forgive, and you will be forgiven."" Mat 6:14-15 (NIV) ""For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But, if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins."" "" Assuming the teaching of Mat 6:15 and other such verses is understood and acknowledged as true, rather than emphasize the need to forgive in this Bible study--i.e., the law--we will instead look at five cheap substitutes or impediments to forgiveness, and then at what real forgiveness is, how to attain it, and how to remain in it. And we may find that forgiveness is more difficult, and more easy, than we first thought. Sin Is Only Human... "" What is natural to ""the flesh"" (the carnal nature) when we have been hurt or abused or insulted is to strike back, to plot revenge, or to simmer in bitterness. This is ""only human"". But God requires forgiveness, else He will NOT forgive us. If we are unwilling--or unable--to forgive, then there is no use asking God for what He has told us He will not give. For believers, dealing with the sin of unforgiveness is first priority. Mark 11:25 (NIV) ""And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins."" "" As a way to test the veracity of the following points, let us consider forgiveness in the most radical sense we can. Think of something truly wicked that has been done to you or someone you love, not by accident or error but deliberately and with malice--where you have come right up against evil and the pain caused by it in your own emotions. 1) What Forgiveness Is Not: Play Acting For Show... "" Remember when as a child you were forced by some adult to ""forgive"" someone who was first forced to ""say sorry"" to you? Is this really repentance by the perpetrator... or forgiveness by the victim? Well, perhaps so--in a few rare cases. But let us be honest and acknowledge that this charade by children is more often a temporary cessation of hostilities for the sake of the grown-ups, with the full intent to do more of the same violence (and not get caught) and/or get revenge later--when beyond the adult's watchful eye. "" Adults force children through this ritual because strife in a family or group of kids is an unbearable pain; and they want to teach. Play-acting does give at least a temporary reprieve. But God's pain is more acute when He sees our strife with each other, and His solution aims a little deeper than mere words or mimicry or delay or coating over. For He is aiming not at hypocritical play-acting, but at truth from the inside out."

"Matthew 2:2-12, Isaiah 60:1-6","('Star', 'Epiphany')",Catholic," Epiphany of the Lord, Sunday January 8, 2017 In literary terms, an epiphany is that moment in the story when a character achieves a realization, awareness or a knowledge of something, after which, events are seen through this prism. 1). One epiphany is in verse 2, the Magi ask the question, ""Where is the new-born King of the Jews""? They were not Jews themselves, but they sought a king; someone they could believe in; someone they could trust and follow. Could it be that they had plenty of everything, except what they needed to make what they had worth possessing? Most of us have enough to live on, but we need enough to live for, to find the meaning in our lives and vocations through Jesus Christ, as the Preface Prayer for Christmas says, ""a new light of your glory has shone upon the eyes our mind... 2). Another Epiphany comes from verse 3 from our First Reading from Isaiah, chapter 60, ""Nations shall walk by your light, and kings by your shining radiance."" We are talking about political powers. Of course, the prophet recognizes that this new society is a long way off from being realized. It is not surprising that the book of Revelation uses this text to speak about the heavenly Jerusalem. We are called to walk in the light now, to act correctly and be ahead of the curve, when all the nations will finally accept Christ. e.g. The Sydney Swans were the joke of the Australian football league. They had the worst record, the worst players, the worst coach, and the worst fans. Most of their home games were played in front of empty seats. But a strange thing happened. The team got a new coach and a few new players--and started winning. Before long, the team that had been the laughing stock of the league was a powerhouse. And since everybody likes a winning team, you can imagine what happened next. The stands began to fill. Thousands of people who had no interest in the team before began to attend games religiously. Soon it became almost impossible to get a ticket to a Swans game. One Sunday afternoon the Swans were playing a rival team in front of a capacity crowd. As the TV cameras zoomed in on the revelry and joy in the stands, one focused on a single man who was cheering and waving a sign that he had obviously made himself. Grinning proudly, he held up his sign for all the world to see: I WAS HERE WHEN NOBODY ELSE WAS! Only follow Him, disregard everything else. 3). Another epiphany is to be open for epiphanies! I read of a story about a guy named Eric who did not like epiphanies because they could be unsettling. He had problems he was trying to work though and he saw another people with worst problems than his and they were reasonably content, even laughing, exchanging hugs, and happy. Seeing this, Eric kept on repeating the phrase over and over, ""I don't get it."" Then one day, it occurred to him how strong his resistance to growth really was. In that moment, he understood that ""I don't get it"" really meant, ""I won't let it."" Fearing failure, he was over-protective but that epiphany helped him to open up to new growth."
Revelation 6:5-6,"('Famine', 'Black Horse', 'Third Seal', 'Third Beast')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 9-19-15 Lesson 16: Third Seal: The Black Horse and its Rider (Revelation 6:5-6) Revelation 6:5-6 (KJV) 5 And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. 6 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine. Introduction The white horse, we learned, is the symbol of power and victory without bloodshed . . . the rider carried only a bow--no arrow. The red horse denotes power and wholesale bloodshed such as this world has never known. The rider of the red horse has been commanded to take peace from the earth, and he carries a great sword. The black horse is a symbol of lamentation and mourning. Here, as in the book of Zechariah, the black horse follows the red--""The first chariot had red horses, the second black"" (Zechariah 6:2). The weeping prophet laments, ""Our skin was black like an oven, because of the terrible famine"" (Lamentations 5:10). Also read Jeremiah 4:28 and Jude13. It will help us to understand the idea behind this passage if we remember that John is giving an account not of the end of things, but of the signs and events which precede the end. So here the black horse and its rider represent famine, a famine which is very severe and causes great hardship, but which is not brutal enough to kill. What John is predicting is a situation in which a man's whole working wage would be needed to buy enough corn for himself for a day, leaving absolutely nothing to buy any of the other necessities of life and absolutely nothing for his wife and family. If instead of corn he bought the much inferior barley, he might manage to give some to his wife and family but again he would have nothing left to buy anything else. Commentary John again says, ""I heard"" and ""I saw."" He just wants to make sure that we know that. The color of the black horse indicates morning (see Jeremiah 4:28; Malachi 3:14), and it also speaks of famine, and it may denote darkness and ignorance. In Lamentations 4:8-9 we read: ""Now their appearance is blacker than soot; They go unrecognized in the streets; Their skin clings to their bones, It has become as dry as wood. Those slain by the sword are better off Than those who die of hunger; For these pine away, Stricken for lack of the fruits of the field."" When Christ opens the third seal another rider appears, but this one is seated upon a black horse, and the third beast cries out ""Come and see"", beckoning the rider. This time he holds no weapon of warfare in his hands; there is however a pair of scales. These balances, like the black horse, suggest scarcity to the extent of famine. Grain was so scarce and dear that it had to be weighed very carefully. Beating plowshares into swords produced no food; but it did destroy the man who produced the food and it prevented the soil from being tilled. Famine always follows war. Food rationing of the strictest order is an aftermath of war, particularly in the warring countries."
Mark 4:1-25,"('Parables', ""God's Word"", 'Farmer And Seed')",Evangelical Free," When a person reads a Bible passage, is it always immediately understood by them?? What do you think are reasons why some bible passages cannot be immediately understood?? Since the Bible was written by God the Holy Spirit and people are not God, there will be some difficulty in fully understanding what is stated! Is there a solution?? A major barrier to not understanding the Bible of course is unbelief. People must truly believe God speaking and allow the Holy Spirit help them understand the Bible! How do we see the Bible? Is the Bible just another book open to our own interpretations? The Bible speaks clearly and directly; we apply the godly principles given. This is one of the lessons we will learn from Jesus this morning as we study the beginning of Mark chapter 4. Open your Bibles there and read along with me Mark 4:1-25; Jesus is now in full swing of His ministry....... v1-2: Jesus' ministry included teaching people in parables. What is a parable? The word parable comes from the Greek (parabole), meaning ""comparison, illustration, analogy"". v3-8: Parable (illustration) of the farmer sowing seeds was told to everyone. If we look at this parable of the farmer and the seeds, to whom it was told, and where and when it was told, there really wasn't anything new that people at that time and place needed to learn. Jesus first spoke of the basics of farming! Then v9..... And so, let us picture this: Jesus was in a boat talking to a large crowd and Jesus told them something the people already knew, farming basics. Now, what do you think the people listening to Jesus would have done after hearing something they already knew?? And so, what do you think God Jesus was trying to do with parables?? v10-12.... Gives us a hint of the use of parables. Jesus used parables to connect with people but it was also a call to listen for more and follow God! And so we can note that, In order to understand God's Word, there needs to be a willingness to learn and believe! Now look again at v13... at first glance it looks like a reprimand right? But then in v14-20, Jesus quickly explains the parable! If it was a reprimand, Jesus could have just said, ""figure it out yourself!"" v13: Jesus challenged His followers and made sure they understood how foundational the message was! And so, let us make sure we understand the explanation of the parable of the farmer and the seeds in v14-20: The farmer could be God Himself or any person based on v21-22 (which we will look at more closely next week) The farmer sows the word. What is the word?? Satan opposes the word. God's word is provided to all types of people: - Stubborn, hard-hearted people never impacted with God's Word (sadly, these types of people do not realize that the demons love them) - Receives God's Word only temporarily but gives up when trouble comes - Receives God's Word but priority is self and the world which choke God's impact - Hears God's Word, accept it, then allows it to grow in their lives to produce multiple good fruit! We will look at the other parables in Mark 4 in the next few weeks; but we need to note that none of the following parables were given further explanations. Again, the parable of the farmer and the seed is foundational to the Kingdom of God here on earth AND again the importance of digging deeper into what God is trying to tell us is very important. Remember the acronyms I shared in the past? God does not like KIAs (know it alls), God loves FIAT people (faithful, inquisitive, available, and teachable). God will bless FIAT people!"
Luke 2:1-20,"('Christmas', 'Deceive', 'Sadness', 'Shepherds And Angels')",Nazarene," We have been learning many things from the important characters of the first Christmas story. It was interesting to see how they received the news regarding the coming of Christ the Messiah in their lives. In all these things, we see the hand of God at work making sure that they understood that this is part of God's marvelous plan. On the first message, we talked about the three wise men who traveled from a far away place in search for the baby Jesus, the King of the Jews. They just followed the star for many years with great perseverance until they arrived to the right place. There, they worshiped Jesus and gave him gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. In coming home, they went through another route to avoid the evil intention of King Herod. We have learned from them that the wise still seek and worship the Lord. May we be like these wise men fully seeking Christ regardless of the difficulties they experienced. Then, last week, we talked about Mary who was pledged to be married to Joseph. But she became pregnant through the power of the Holy Spirit. After learning about this, Joseph wanted to divorce her secretly so that she would not suffer public disgrace. But the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph and assured him that this is part of God's plan. That this is in fulfillment of the prophecy regarding a virgin who will give birth to a son. He will call him Immanuel which means God is with us. Joseph understood God's plan for salvation and his heart was at peace. Mary too understood God's plan and recognized that she needed a Savior from her sin. May we be like Mary and Joseph who fully accepted in their hearts the coming of Christ the King. Do you know that George Frederick Handel's great Christmas oratorio, ""The Messiah"", was first performed in 1742, in Dublin. During that time, King George of England attended and supported his first performance. And this in turn led to one of the most interesting traditions connected to this masterpiece. When the Hallelujah chorus began to play in the performance the King attended he abruptly stood up, apparently as a way of indicating he recognized that Christ was the King of Kings. Now it was normal protocol that if the King stood at any time, no one in his presence sat, and so the entire audience stood for the performance of the Hallelujah Chorus. This tradition has been maintained even until today. Everywhere you go, whenever the Hallelujah chorus is played, people will stand in order to recognize that Christ is the King of Kings. Handel could never have anticipated that this work would become perhaps the most performed piece of classical music in all of history, all to the glory of Christ. We too must recognize that Christ is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. Before we continue our study today, let me first give you some simple truths about Christmas that probably you are not aware of: 1. Do you know that the Puritans (the first Christians who traveled from England to America) at first forbade the singing of some Christmas carols judging them to be out of keeping with the true spirit of Christmas?"
Hebrews 11:6,"('Freedom', ""God's Power"", 'Recovery')",Baptist," Last week we said all of us need recovery because none of us is perfect. The root cause is our sin nature, our desire to play God, to be in control rather than give God control. So we've each been hurt, we've each hurt others, and we've each hurt ourselves. And we find ourselves constantly dealing with fear, frustration, failure, and fatigue. How do we break this death spiral? Not by our will power. Only by God's power can we see life change. Through the cross Christ has won victory over sin and death. Through faith in Him and learning to yield to His daily control, we can be delivered not only from sin's penalty and presence one day, but from sin's power today and everyday. But we have to get past denial. How? John Maxwell says there are 3 things that help a person to move past denial and on to change: A. We change because we've learned enough we want to. B. We change because we've received enough we're empowered to. C. We change because we hurt enough we have to. Most of us don't consider the possibility of change until we hurt enough that we have to. We rarely change when we see the light; we often change when we feel the heat. Most people never move into recovery until they're forced into it, because there's no other option. Only then are they willing to learn enough and receive enough to change. If you want positive change to come to your life, it can happen by the power God gives. But only if you're willing to first realize that you're in no position to control your life. You must give control to God. That's the first letter in ""recovery"" - Realize. Now today, we're moving to the second letter in ""recovery"" - E stands for Earnestly. Earnestly believe that God exists, that I matter to Him, and that He has the power to help me recover. (READ TEXT) There are three parts to taking Step 2 to finding our freedom in Christ. 1. Acknowledge God's Existence. Many of you have no problem in this. Not just because you're in church today, but because there just aren't that many atheists left anymore. A recent Gallup poll revealed that ""96% of Americans say they believe in God, while less than 2% say they are an atheist. We have fewer atheists than 50 years ago. Why? Because as we learn about the universe, fewer folks believe it happened accidentally. It takes more faith not to believe in a Creator than to believe in one. If I took a watch apart, put it in a bag, shook it up, and emptied the contents, and if it all just came out exactly as it was, the odds would be pretty incredible. But our universe is full of ""watches."" If you multiply that times a zillion you get the odds of it just happening. Where there's a Creation there's a Creator. Where there's an effect there is a cause. Where there's design there's a designer. A leading scientist from Israel, Gerald Schroeder, claims science has proven the existence of God as described in Genesis. He has over 30 years experience in research and teaching; has earned his Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctorate degrees at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and holds two Doctorate degrees in earth sciences and physics. He says science has proven the universe was created out of nothing. However, for something to come out of nothing, there needs to be an acting force. In science they call that, the force of nature. However, that ""force of nature"" is described almost exactly as the God of Genesis in the Bible. He points out there are four key properties of the ""force of nature"" that align with the biblical teachings of God. First, this force predates the universe. Second, it is not physical (in other words, it is not made of physical matter). Third, it acts on the physical. Fourth it can create the physical out of nothing."
Joel 1:1-20,"('Prayer', 'Repentance', 'Sin Destroys')",Assembly Of God," It's A Bug's Life Text: Joel 1:1-20 Introduction 1. Illustration: When we were pastoring a church in Yellville, AR, there were some structural problems with the building that concerned me. There was a dip in the floor of about 2 or 3 inches that ran across the sanctuary. So I contacted the insurance company and so they sent out an insurance adjuster to assess the situation. He crawled under the church and discovered the problem. There were several support pillars that held up the floor joists that had collapsed causing the floor to drop. The cause, the pillars were wooden and had been eaten through by termites. These bugs had not only eaten through the wooden pillars but had eaten a large percentage of the underneath of the church building, and no one knew it because no one bothered to look. Later I emailed one of my professors from Bible college and told him about the situation. His response was, ""Did you ever imagine bugs would have so much to do with your ministry?"" 2. There is a spiritual lesson for all of us to learn from this story. Like termites, sin can eat away at our spiritual life and cause us to collapse even though no one can see it from the outside. 3. The spiritual truth of this story is... A. Sin Destroys B. A Call To Repentance C. A Call To Prayer 4. Let's stand together as we read Joel 1:1-20. Proposition: Undealt with sin can destroy us, but God offers us a way out. Transition: We must all come to grips with the truth that... I. Sin Destroys (1-7). A. Army Of Locust 1. This opening chapter to the Book of Joel shows us the danger of not allowing God to deal with the sin in our lives. 2. The book begins with, ""The LORD gave this message to Joel son of Pethuel."" A. We know very little about Joel the prophet or his father Pethuel, other than Joel prophesied to the Southern kingdom of Judah during the reign of Joash (New Spirit-Filled Life Study Bible, 1078). B. Joel began his prophecy, as did his contemporary Hosea and his later contemporary Micah (and as did Zephaniah in the seventh century), by identifying himself and his lineage. C. More important, he clearly declared the divine source of his prophecy and therefore the need for readers to heed his utterance. D. Since the message was God's, not man's, it was to be followed implicitly (Patterson, The Expositor's Bible Commentary - Volume 7: Daniel and the Minor Prophets, 237). 3. He prophecy begins with, ""Hear this, you leaders of the people. Listen, all who live in the land. In all your history, has anything like this happened before? 3 Tell your children about it in the years to come, and let your children tell their children. Pass the story down from generation to generation."" A. Joel therefore commanded his people--from the eldest citizen downward--to give careful attention to what he had to say. B. None could recall such an intense and devastating calamity as the locust plague that had fallen on them. C. For this reason Joel's message and instructions based on the locust plague deserved to be handed down successively to the generations that followed (Patterson, 237)."
Luke 2:25-35,"('Christmas', 'Patience', 'Simeon', 'Bless Others')",Nazarene," WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM SIMEON We are continuing our Christmas series. We have been learning a lot of spiritual lessons from the wise men, Mary and Joseph and the shepherds. From the wise men, we learned that it is always wise to seek the Lord. From Mary, we learned that we need a Savior from our sins. From Joseph, we learned that we can trust His plan for our lives even though we cannot at first understand it. From the shepherds, we learned that when we listen to the message and act on it, it brings great joy in our lives. The Christmas season is not only a time of celebration but of learning new spiritual truths. There was a story of a store owner who was doing some last minute Christmas shopping with his young son. Suddenly, he saw another store owner with whom he had been friends for some time. The two of them exchanged greetings and spoke with each other. They talk about what a financially profitable season it had been for their respective stores. The small boy overheard his father say, ""This has been the best Christmas ever.!"" As the store owners parted company, the father and son continued their shopping. But the father noticed his son had become very quiet. He inquired as to his son's silence. His son replied, ""Dad, you just told Mr. Johnson that this was the best Christmas ever."" His dad replied, ""I did, son. The economy is great, and the people are really spending a lot."" ""O.K."", the son replied, ""It's just that I always thought that the first Christmas was the best one ever."" Indeed, the first Christmas is the best ever because Christ came to be one of us and to fulfill the purpose of the Father. That is why we need to keep on learning new spiritual truths this Christmas. So, what new things have you been learning this Christmas? Today, we will learn from the life of Simeon. Many of you probably are not familiar with this man. He was present at the temple courts when Joseph and Mary brought the boy Jesus to present him to the Lord. Simeon was a devout and righteous man. In fact, he had been waiting patiently for the Messiah to come. The Holy Spirit told him that he would not die until he saw for himself the Messiah. And so, when he saw the little boy Jesus, he took him by his arms and blessed him. He also declared words that made Mary and Joseph marveled at the things that God has planned for their son. These words are part of the Christmas message for us to reflect upon. WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THE LIFE OF SIMEON: 1. SIMEON WAS WAITING FOR THE CONSOLATION OF ISRAEL Luke 2:25-26 (NIV) ""25 Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him. 26 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Messiah. The name ""Simeon"" means ""God has heard."" That means, he was close to God's heart and his prayers had been heard by God. His two character traits are being righteous and devout. Being righteous refers to his moral conduct among the people while devout refers to his devotion and commitment to God."
Colossians 1:15-17,"('Firstborn', 'Jesus Creator', 'Christ The Sustainer')",Independent/Bible," ""A Hymn to the Supremacy of Christ"" (Part 1) Colossians 1:15-17 It is thought that these verses in Colossians 1 were perhaps sung as an early Christian Hymn. Paul ends with verses 13-14: ""He (the Father) has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, 14 in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins."" From a shameful death on the cross 30 years before, Colossians 1:15-20 comprises a glorious tribute of exaltation to the Lord Jesus Christ: ""He (the Lord Jesus) is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. 16 For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him. 17 And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist."" 18 ""And He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence. 19 For it pleased the Father that in Him all the fullness should dwell, 20 and by Him to reconcile all things to Himself, by Him, whether things on earth or things in heaven, having made peace through the blood of His cross."" The Supremacy of Christ in Creation: The Image of the Invisible This hymn is divided into two separate tributes to Jesus and both are explicit and implicit in declaring Jesus as God. Verses 15-17 glorify the Lord Jesus Christ in a Hymn to the Supremacy of Christ in Creation. Verses 18-20 glorify Jesus in a Hymn to His Supremacy in Redemption, which we will look at in our next study. The divine description unmistakably declares Jesus as Deity in that He is the IMAGE of the invisible God. Although man was made in the image of God (Gen. 1:27), Man is NOT God. As the image of the invisible God, The Son is Himself God. The Son is GOD REVEALED in the Flesh. How can we say that? Well, look at Colossians 2:3: ""in whom ( in Jesus) are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."" Again in Colossians 2:9: ""For in Him (again, in Jesus) dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily."" Romans 9:5 proclaims this fact: ""Christ came, who is over all, the eternally blessed God. Amen."" Philippians 2:6 also agrees: ""(Jesus,) who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God."" All of the treasures, wisdom, knowledge...all of the fullness of God is in Christ, bodily: Jesus is God made manifest bodily: God ""tabernacled"" (made His dwelling) with man in the Son. ""It is in the Son that the invisible God has become visible, so that man sees him who is invisible"" ). (p. 72 William Hendriksen, ""Colossians Commentary) Two powerful examples appear in the first letter to Timothy. First, in 1 Timothy 1:17: ""Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen."" Jesus is the King of Kings which is also stated in 1 Timothy 6:15-16: ""He who is the blessed and only Potentate (He is the only sovereign ruler over all the created order), the King of kings and Lord of lords, 16 who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see, to whom be honor and everlasting power. Amen."" Here, Jesus shares all of the same qualities of God."

John 10:10,"('Gospel Of John', 'Serving')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," In this text we notice the following things: 1. What the devil has to offer to us. 2. What God has to offer to us. 3. The last thing we notice is that they do not offer the same thing. Remember: 1. You cannot serve both God and Satan. 2. Satan can offer you temporary joy, while God can offer you everlasting joy. 3. You will either spend eternity in heaven or hell, you cannot spend eternity in both places."
"Isaiah 43:15-18, Exodus 12:1-2","('Heaven', 'Mulligan', 'Second  Chance')",Pentecostal," God Gives a Mulligans PPT 1 Title First I want to discuss when we give a mulligan. For those who don't know let me explain mulligans. Mulligans are do-overs for bad shots in golf. I am not a very good golfer so I have become a connoisseur of mulligans out of necessity. The guys I play with have 3 kinds of mulligans: 1. First hole first shot You are just starting out and need to get warmed up. Since this is the first Sunday of the New Year we could call that the New Year's mulligan. In other words if you make some sort of resolution, and slip, give yourself a mulligan and start over. It's nice to allow yourself a mulligan. 2. During the round if you mess up a drive. We will call that the whoopsie mulligan 3. Pastor privilege mulligan. Since I am usually the worst golfer when I play with the men of the church, they give me a couple extra mulligans during the round, if I need them. We will call that the we don't want you to quit mulligan. (Or preach an mean angry sermon on Sunday!) But even to some of the better players if they are having a really bad day we may tell them not to count a shot. It's better to give a mulligan that to have someone quit in frustration. God would rather give you a mulligan than for you to quit the race, and throw in the towel. So we give mulligans because we know we will mess up, because it takes some of the pressure off, and if we don't make allowances friends may quit. Now let's talk about when God gives mulligans. We are going to look at two short passages of scripture, here is the first: PPT 2 - 4 Text Isa 43:15 ""I am the LORD, your Holy One, The Creator of Israel, your King."" Isa 43:16 Thus says the LORD, Who makes a way through the sea And a path through the mighty waters, Isa 43:17 Who brings forth the chariot and the horse, The army and the mighty man (They will lie down together [and] not rise again; They have been quenched [and] extinguished like a wick): Isa 43:18 ""Do not call to mind the former things, Or ponder things of the past. Isa 43:19 ""Behold, I will do something new, Now it will spring forth; Will you not be aware of it? I will even make a roadway in the wilderness, Rivers in the desert. This promise was made to the Jewish nation when they were reeling from judgment and the consequences of their own actions. Have you ever had to face the consequences of your own actions? Wouldn't it be nice if, at that time, you got handed a mulligan? That is exactly what God is doing to the Jewish nation. Turn to your neighbor and say, ""God gives mulligans."" Now add, ""and so should you!"" That is a good sermon right there. 1st thing I want you to know about when God gives a mulligan, is that it is a clean break with the past. PPT 5 text Isaiah 43:18 ""Do not call to mind the former things, Or ponder things of the past. It is of no benefit to live your life in the broken pieces of yesterday. God says let it go. Don't bring it up again. You can't go forward looking backwards. (Illustrate by trying to walk forwards while looking backwards.) Some people want to live in the mistakes of yesterday. (Either yours or theirs.) God on the other hand prefers to leave the past on the cross. (Yours and theirs!)"
"James 1:26-27, James 3:2-8","('Tongue', 'Religious', 'Tongue Is A Fire', 'Words Matter')",Christian/Church Of Christ," ARE YOU RELIGIOUS? (part one) James 1:26-27 INTRODUCTION: When people would ask me if I was religious I would say, no, because to me, being religious kind of had a negative connotation. Because typically, a person's idea of religious is going through rituals and practices associated with the faith. But to me it was so much more than that. Because anyone can go through the motions without being sincere in their devotion to God. Interestingly, God has his own definition about it means to be religious. So regardless what we think it means, we should learn what God has said it is. What is religion? Probably if you ask different people you'll get different answers. Theologians are good at taking something and using a lot of intellectual words to describe it. Here is an example of a theologian's definition of religion; ""Religion originates in an attempt to represent and order beliefs, feelings, imaginings and actions that arise in response to direct experience of the sacred and the spiritual. As this attempt expands in its formulation and elaboration, it becomes a process that creates meaning for itself on a sustaining basis, in terms of both its originating experiences and its own continuing responses."" Did you get all that? No, well, good, now I don't feel as bad. I think God has given us a more simplistic idea of what religion is. James 1:26-27, ""If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless. Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world."" This is pure religion. There are religious activities and religious observances but the heart of religion is what we find here in James. James is good at defining things. He did it here with religion and he does it in the next chapter regarding faith. James cuts through the idea of what something is and highlights the reality of what something is. And it really has to do with showing proof. It's like he's from Missouri; the 'show me' state. You say you have faith? Show me. You say you're religious? Show me. James highlights a few 'show mes' when it comes to being religious. Pure religion is keeping a tight rein on my tongue. First one's pretty easy, right? Not! 1) Why the tongue? There could have been any number of things James could've mentioned that would've been important. Why single out the tongue? It's really about total self-control. If the tongue is in check then the rest of you will be too. James 3:2-8, ""We all stumble in many ways. If anyone is never at fault in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to keep his whole body in check. When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal. Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go. Likewise the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark. The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell. All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and creatures of the sea are being tamed and have been tamed by man, but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison."""
"Psalms 102:2-3, Proverbs 3:7-8","('Forgiveness', 'Healing', 'God Our Great Physician', ""God's Prescription"")",Foursquare," Spiritual First Aid ""God's Prescription For The Soul"" Introduction Physicians and psychologists along with the prescription drug industry would like us to think that all these diseases and problems, these maladies in which we are experiencing is the result of a some chemical imbalance, or symptoms of something physically happening within us that they can provide a pill or medication for. And this may very well be the case. We are born in a world that's filled with and experiencing the consequences of sin. As such we are born with or acquire in this life various diseases and mental disorders. Yet, after referring many people to doctors, what I've come to realize in my over 20 years of pastoring, counseling, and coaching, is that the majority of these maladies, with the exception of some physiological, psychological and physical diseases, are caused by and are a consequence of our own sinful behaviors. It's with this in mind I am writing this spiritual first aid manual to deal with the spiritual side of many of these maladies and behavioral issues that we face in life. We'll look at many of these and then what the Bible says about them, that is, the prescription that God gives. Those in the medical field like to prescribe medications to counter these ailments and symptoms, but when we're unable to receive these medications we try medicating ourselves through alcohol, illegal drugs, and destructive behaviors like sexual immorality and gambling. But prescribed medication and self-medication have destructive side effects. Consider the side effects of prescription drugs. Often time they're worse than what they're supposed to cure. Take for instance the drug Paxil, or it's generic counterpart, Parozetine. It's called a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, and is used to treat depression, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, panic attacks, and post-traumatic stress disorders. It works through increasing serotonin to the brain. And while this drug has brought normality to many, the side effects can kill you, like suicidal thoughts in children, teenagers and young adults. Side effects also include ""weakness, sweating, nausea, decreased appetite, drowsiness, dizziness, trouble sleeping, shaking, nervousness, sexual problems, dry mouth, constipation, yawning, infection, (and) diarrhea."" A less common side effect is what is known as ""Serotonin syndrome (a potentially life-threatening drug reaction that causes the body to have too much serotonin, a chemical produced by the nerve cells) with symptoms such as mental status changes (such as agitation or hallucinations), an increase in your heart rate and temperature, lack of coordination, overactive reflexes, muscle rigidity, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea."" It also has been known to increase abnormal bleeding or bruising, manic behavior, bone fractures, and seizures. There also exist side effects to unborn babies. As a disclaimer, I am not saying forgo modern medicine, because I believe God can and does heal through doctors and hospitals, but I also believe that we've come to rely upon medications too much. As a result there are now new strains to old diseases that have no medical cure."

John 3:16,"('Jesus', 'God')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational, When we look at the text John 3:16 we notice the following: 1. God sent his one and only son Jesus to the world out of love. 2.

"Matthew 14:27, Matthew 9:2","('New Year', ""Christ's Presence"", 'Forgiven', 'Optimistic')",Nazarene," WHY I AM AN OPTIMIST THIS 2017 INTRODUCTION: Happy New Year to everyone. Welcome to 2017. A bright new year is ahead of us. I wonder if you have the same feeling or outlook in this year as I do. Many years ago, former President Reagan in his news conference at the start of the new year declared to the world, ""You can look pessimistically on the world today or you can look optimistically "" he said, ""I chose the optimistic look."" That is true. You can choose to be an optimist for the entire year or you can be a pessimist. Your outlook will determine your ultimate destiny for your life. Here is a picture of a person walking down the field - his outlook on the field can either be dry or green. There is a big difference between an optimist and a pessimist person. A story is told of two identical twins who were alike in every way except one thing. One was a hope-filled optimist who only saw the bright side of life. While the other was a pessimist, who only saw the dark side in every situation. The parents were so worried about the extremes of optimism and pessimism in their boys that they seek the advice of a psychologist. The psychologist suggested a plan of action. ""On their next birthday, give the pessimist a shiny new bike, but give the optimist only a pile of manure and watch their reaction. Hopefully, this will bring them to a new balance."" It seemed a fairly extreme thing to do, but there is no harm in trying. After all, the parents had always treated their boys equally in the past. But in this instance, they will try to follow the psychologist's advice. So, when the twin's birthday came, they gave the pessimist the most expensive, top of the line, racing bike a child has ever wanted. But when he saw the bike, his first words were, ""I'll probably crash and break my leg."" However, to the optimist, they gave a carefully wrapped box of manure. He opened it, looked puzzled for a moment, then ran outside and screaming, ""You can't fool me! Where there's this much manure, there's just gotta be a pony around here somewhere!"" That is an optimist. Even in a box of manure, he could see a pony! According to the Thesaurus, being an optimistic person is someone who believes positively and favorably at life. Therefore, this thought prompts him to have a cheerful countenance, confident and a buoyant attitude at all times. He sees the opportunity in every difficulty. It is good to be an optimist in life. While a pessimistic person is someone who is always expecting a bad outcome of the situation. Such outlook will prompt him to be more depressed, despondent and discouraged at life. He sees the difficulty in every opportunity. It is not good to live with a pessimistic person. I heard about a story of two convicts in prison who were looking out at the same window one night. The pessimist only saw the dry ground with all its dirt and darkness but the optimist saw the stars with all its light and brightness. We must always look at the brighter side of life. I heard about one man suffering from deep depression and decided to commit suicide."
1 Samuel 14:24-46,"('Jonathan', 'Decision Making', 'Inconsistency', 'King Saul')",Nazarene," BEWARE OF INCONSISTENCY INTRODUCTION: We will continue our series on the Book of 1 Samuel. We are now in the second half of chapter 14. We will be focusing our lessons on the inconsistencies displayed by the decisions of King Saul. His inconsistencies as the King brought about harmful consequences to Israel from the hands of the Philistines. The word ""Inconsistency"" means a person who is living a life of contradiction. I was speaking one time to a friend whom I have not seen for a long time. I asked him, ""Are you a Christian?"" He said, ""Yes, I am"" I asked, ""Have you received Christ as your Lord and Savior! ""Yes, I am"" ""Do you smoke?"" ""Yes. I do."" ""Do you still think liquor?"" ""Yes. I still do!"" A person is inconsistent if what he believes is not compatible to his action. To Christians, inconsistency in life is very detrimental or harmful to our testimony for the cause of Christ. According to the Barna research, 86% of teens claim that they are Christians but they act differently. Out of those who claim they are Christians, only 34% are born again. And only 3 out of 5 say that they believe the Bible is totally accurate in all it teaches. At the same time, many Christians embrace the views that are inconsistent with what the Bible says. For instance, two out of three stated that Satan is not a living being. They believe that Satan is merely a symbol of evil. That is being inconsistent with what the Bible says. Also, about 60% argued that a good person could earn eternal salvation through good deeds. That is incorrect. We are saved by faith alone not of works lest anyone should boast. Brothers and sisters, beware of inconsistencies from what the Bible teaches. People close to us are hearing what we are saying and watching what we are doing. When they see a fault line to our words or actions, they will have a negative outlook on Christianity altogether. When this happens, our Christian witness will be weakened and become ineffective. That is why we must beware of any inconsistency in our profession of faith with what the Bible says. We must be watchful between the discrepancy of our words and actions. Hebrews 13:8 (NIV) ""Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever."" Christ is consistent. Christ does not change. He is the same yesterday, today and forever. We must do the same. We must be consistent in living holy lives for the rest of our lives. We must be consistent in abhorring evil. We must be consistent in doing our utmost service for God. We must be consistent in believing the foundational truths from the Bible. When we are consistent with our Christian testimony, our outlook for the rest of the New year will always be great. Regardless of the many trials and difficulties we will go through this New year, we can face them all with courage. Regardless of the many temptations we face, we can overcome them all because we are consistent. I cam upon a cartoon regarding the inconsistency of a company executive. The man said, ""The shipment will be delayed. We were supposed to order the trucks to get loaded at 9:00 a.m., but we accidentally ordered the truckers to get loaded at 9:00 a.m."""
Revelation 6:7-8,"('Death', 'Come And See', 'Fourth Seal', 'Pale Horse', 'Death And Hell')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 10/8/2015 Title: Fourth Seal: The Pale Horse and Its Rider (Revelation 6:7-8) Revelation 6:7-8 (KJV) 7 And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see. 8 And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth. Introduction Following in the wake of the famine comes another horse, still more terrible in its symbolic meaning. It is pale, meaning livid and corpselike. The rider is called Death, the aftermath of war and famine. The fourth living creature is given divine authority to send him into the world. Under the three previous seals, a false peace was followed by war and famine on the earth. There have been furious wars, famines, and death-dealing plagues in the past, but nothing comparable to this event which is still in the future. Its fury is depicted in its widespread effects, killing one-fourth of the earth's population. This is the result of the foregoing judgments--the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence--which God calls ""My four sore judgments"" (Ezekiel 14:21). As we approach this passage we must once again remember that it is not telling of the final end but of the signs which precede it. That is why it is a fourth part of the earth which is involved in death and disaster. This is a terrible time but it is not the time of total destruction. Commentary The Lamb ""opened the fourth seal""--and as they see the Lamb opening the seals--they realize that God is in control and that His purposes will be accomplished. And the ""fourth"" living creature said, ""Come!,"" calling a rider on a ""pale horse."" The drive for conquest (white horse), had led to warfare and bloodshed (red horse), which had brought famine and pestilence (black horse), resulting in ""death"" and the grave (pale horse). The ""pale"" color (literally a pale green) indicates the color of death. The four riders were given ""power over the forth part of the earth to kill"" people by ""sword,"" famine and plague, and by the wild ""beasts."" ""Death"" by wild ""beasts"" would be expected when millions of people have died through war, famine and plague. The number of one-fourth of the earth, working from present-day numbers, would mean over a billion people would die in this first wave of judgment were it to happen today. But nothing that cataclysmic has occurred in all of history. There are four instruments of judgment mentioned in the clause ""to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth."" It is interesting to note that the four judgments named here are the same four with which Jehovah threatened guilty Jerusalem in the past: ""For thus saith the Lord God; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?"" (Ezekiel 14:21). The ""sword"" named under the second seal, and ""hunger"" named under the third seal, are here reproduced, and coupled with two others--pestilence and the ""beasts of the earth."" In Leviticus there is a passage which tells of the penalties which God will send upon His people because of their disobedience. Wild beasts will rob them of their children and destroy their cattle and make them few in number. The sword will avenge their breaches of the covenant. When they are gathered in their cities the pestilence will be among them. He will break the staff of bread and they will eat and not be satisfied (Leviticus 26:21-26)."
Exodus 13:17-14:31,"('Exodus', 'Journey')",*other," The Journey Exodus 13:17-14:31 I. Introduction Review: This past Sunday we look at the first part of Exodus 13, and in those verses we noticed the importance to be a people that takes the necessary steps to pursue sanctification. Remember: Sanctification is the idea of being set-apart for God. To be pursue holiness as He is holy. Context: Before we get too far, lets just remember what the scene is here at this point in Exodus: The people have been in bondage in Egypt for over 400 years. This bondage was preceded by a season in which Joseph held a high position in Egypt because of his ability to interpret the dreams that the Pharaoh was having. He instructed that there was going to be a big famine and that Egypt should prepare. As a result, the Pharaoh put him as 2nd in command. Israel benefitted from this because this preparation would preserve them during this famine. Over time the Egyptian dynasty changed, and turned on Israel by putting them into bondage. Finally, Moses was born. He was to be thrown into the Nile, but instead was adopted into the Egyptian household. Long story short, Moses was called by God to the instrument to call Pharaoh to release the Israelites. Pharaoh repeatedly said no, and God poured out 10 plagues upon Egypt to change Pharaoh's heart. We are now at the point in the story where the people have been set free. They are stepping out on to a NEW JOURNEY with God, but this journey is not going to be a easy ""walk in the park"" (no pun intended). God will still use some pretty amazing events to grow them in their faith.?? What does your journey look like? If your anything like me, the journey that God has you on hasn't included any ""writing on the wall"", or ""burning bush"" experiences. Instead it has been a journey of faith where the clarity has been all but clear at times.? Fair Weather Mountain Illustration: Fair-weather Mountain is one of the most spectacular mountains North America. Located off the southeast coast of Alaska, the mountain reaches 15,000 feet above sea level. Massive granite walls with deep ravines cut by cascading glaciers create an inspiring view. This view, however, can only be seen about twenty days a year when the weather is fair. The mountain is called Fair-weather because you can only see the full glory and beauty of the mountain when the fog clears. Author, John Eldredge, uses Fair-weather Mountain as an illustration to describe how most people live their lives. ""Twenty days a year-that sounds like my life. I think I see what's really going on about that often. The rest of the time, it feels like fog ... I'd love to wake up each morning knowing exactly who I am and where God is taking me. Zeroed in on all my relationships, undaunted in my calling. It's awesome when I do see. But for most of us, life is more like driving with a dirty windshield. I can make out the shapes ahead, and I think the light is green...The description of the Christian life shouted in the New Testament compared with the actual experience is embarrassing ... we look a little foolish, like little children who've been held back a grade.

"Micah 6:8, Luke 15:20","('Love', 'What Can A Kiss Show?')",Assembly Of God," WHAT IS THE GREATEST ACT OF LOVE? A KISS? By Wade Martin Hughes, Sr. Kyfingegrs@aol.com While this lesson is about THE KISS, perhaps the greatest act of love is TO LISTEN! Micah 6:8 He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? 1. THE WORD KISS, KISSES AND KISSED IS IN THE BIBLE 48 TIMES. THE OLD TESTAMENT HAS THE MOST REFERENCES TO THE KISS. WHAT WOULD YOU DO? There was a popular PRIME MINISTER IN ENGLAND NAMED WILLIAM EWARD GLADSTONE... GLADSTONE had heard about PRINCESS ALICE of the Royal Family dying. So Gladstone called for THE HOUSE OF COMMONS to have a VOTE OF SYMPHATHY for the Royal Family. The House listened as Gladstone told the account of the death. PRINCESS ALICE'S CHILD was very sick with DIPHTHERIA. The Doctor explained in great detail how dangerous ""A KISS"" could be. So the doctor warned the whole family, under NO CIRCUMSTANCE was anyone to KISS the child. One night the child had a terrible night with fever and spasms. The child was in great pain and was in a coma. PRINCESS ALICE WAS HOLDING THE CHILD IN HER ARMS WHEN SHE AWOKE AND LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM. AT THAT TIME THE DAUGHTER OF ALICE SEEMED TO BE AFRAID AND THE LITTLE GIRL CRIED OUT:KISS ME MOMMA, MOMMA PLEASE, KISS ME! What would you do? Her precious daughter was burning up with fever and she asked her MOMMA: PLEASE KISS ME! What else would any loving mother do? She kissed her sick daughter several times and held her near her heart. This KISSED COST THE MOTHER, PRINCESS ALICE HER LIFE. She soon had Diphtheria, at this time in history, DIPHTHERIA WAS DEADLY TO ADULTS... 2. A KISS CAN COST A BIG PRICE... KEZAZAH TRADITION... WILL WE LEARN THE KISS OF FORGIVENESS? ACTION VS. REACTION... WE NEED TO BE PROACTIVE... Luke 15:20 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. AS THOSE THAT UNDERSTAND JEWISH LAW AND TRADITION TO DO CERTAIN THINGS WOULD DEFILE YOU AND YOU COULD NOT GO INTO THE TEMPLE AND YOU COULD NOT TOUCH OTHER GOOD PEOPLE. Seems religious practices were to be repulsed by SIN and SINNERS? While God hates sin, never forget GOD LOVES SINNERS. THE JEWISH HAD A TRADITION CALLED ""KEZAZAH."" In the kezazah ceremony when a wayward family member embarrassed the family name there was a price to be paid. if they ever returned to the village the ""mayor"" would take a glass PITCHER and throw and BREAK IT at the feet of the OFFENDER. This public disgrace was terrible. OFTEN THE TOWN WOULD REFUSE RE-ENTRY TO THIS ""TERRIBLE PERSON""... This Father knew this KENAZAH CERMONY and he desired to save his son this ugly experience. THE FATHER WENT OUT AND SAT ON THE HILL BEFORE THE CITY LIMITS, AND WAITED DAY AFTER DAY. This is a lesson OF GRACE BEFORE THE JUDGMENT."
Genesis 6:1-8,"('Evil', 'Grief', 'Consequences', 'Backlash')",Baptist," WICKEDNESS That INVITES REPERCUSSION-V--Genesis 6:1-8 Attention: Fruit Wrap--A picky customer went to a small local fruit stand struggling to stay in afloat. They had just received a new delivery of fresh fruit & were thrilled to earn any customer's business. A customer walks up & says to the saleswoman, ""Give me 5 pounds of oranges & wrap every orange up in a separate piece of paper, please."" She did just as the customer asked. ""I'd also like 6 pounds of plums, please, & wrap up every one in a separate piece of paper, too."" She did. ""And what is in those bins behind you?"" he asks, pointing out two bushel baskets in the corner. ""Cherries & Raisins,"" said the saleswoman, ""But they are not for sale!"" Self-service, self-love, & flesh-driven feeling wreak havoc on us & others. In Noah's day most everyone had effectively--'made spiritual mountains of mole-hills & molehills of mountains'--by not considering &/or being indifferent toward their Creator. Likewise today, when Christ is considered inconsequential to a person's or nation's life, vitally important matters are treated as though they were of little worth. Simultaneously, other things become elevated to the place of indispensability, taking Christ's place as Head. If we are not very careful to honor Christ, we find ourselves making great sacrifices for that which has no eternal value, for the sake of temporal satisfaction. Genesis records the wanton wickedness of humanity & its repercussions. Repercussion--An unintended consequence occurring some time after an event or action, esp. an unwelcome one. Wanton wickedness invites repercussion from God. How/When does wickedness invite repercussion? 7 channels thru which wickedness invites repercussion. 7 aberrations of wickedness that invite repercussion.

CONTINUITY/Persistence(:5) 5--Wickedness also invites repercussion thru (An) Aberrant... GRIEF(:6) Explanation: (:6) :6--""And the LORD was sorry that He had made man on the earth, & He was grieved in His heart."" Our Creator(""YaHoWeH"") was so hurt by man's overwhelmingly pretentious & pompous self-centered ""evil"" that He ""was sorry"" that he had even created mankind. Does this mean that God did not know what would happen? & that He lives in the day-to-day tension of what man will do next? That He is ever learning, His decisions being caught up in & bound to His own finite & linear creation? NO!!--He knows all things & knows us intimately--so much so that He knows us better than we know ourselves! God did not change of mind, but change of way--Matthew Henry Such an intensity of emotion may be approached & mimicked(experienced/felt) when we become inundated & crushed with frustration when our major work is not only unappreciated, but has become outright contemptible, deplorable, shameful, & disgraceful to the very ones to whom we have given our all. God has a ""heart"" that is capable of being ""grieved."" For God to be grieved is for Him to experience a horrific loss & experience the willful separation of His creation from Himself. It is the grief we would associate with adultery, except extended to a level of perfection & holiness which is unattainable by man. It is the reason for the existence of hell."
Judges 1:1-21,"('Greatness', 'Judge')",Baptist," What if everyone did whatever they wanted? - Week 1: A Great Generation Dies Text: Judges 1.1-21. Introduction: 1. In 1998 Tom Brokaw wrote a book about the men and women who persevered through the days of the great depression and later fought and won WW2. He wrote this as part of his introduction and explanation for his purpose to write the book... ""In the spring of 1984, I went to the northwest of France, to Normandy, to prepare an NBC documentary on the fortieth anniversary of D-Day, the massive and daring Allied invasion of Europe that marked the beginning of the end of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich. There, I underwent a life-changing experience. As I walked the beaches with the American veterans who had returned for this anniversary, men in their sixties and seventies, and listened to their stories, I was deeply moved and profoundly grateful for all they had done. Ten years later, I returned to Normandy for the fiftieth anniversary of the invasion, and by then I had come to understand what this generation of Americans meant to history. It is, I believe, the greatest generation any society has ever produced."" Mr. Brokaw said a bit farther on..."" At a time in their lives when their days and nights should have been filled with innocent adventure, love, and the lessons of the workaday world, they were fighting in the most primitive conditions possible across the bloodied landscape of France, Belgium, Italy, Austria, and the coral islands of the Pacific. They answered the call to save the world from the two most powerful and ruthless military machines ever assembled, instruments of conquest in the hands of fascist maniacs. They faced great odds and a late start, but they did not protest. They succeeded on every front. They won the war; they saved the world. They came home to joyous and short-lived celebrations and immediately began the task of rebuilding their lives and the world they wanted. They married in record numbers and gave birth to another distinctive generation, the Baby Boomers. A grateful nation made it possible for more of them to attend college than any society had ever educated, anywhere. They gave the world new science, literature, art, industry, and economic strength unparalleled in the long curve of history. As they now reach the twilight of their adventurous and productive lives, they remain, for the most part, exceptionally modest. They have so many stories to tell, stories that in many cases they have never told before, because in a deep sense they didn't think that what they were doing was that special, because everyone else was doing it too. Mr. Brokaw expressed his conviction about that generation as follows... ""it is, I believe, the greatest generation any society has ever produced."" He argued that these men and women fought not for fame and recognition, but because it was the... ""right thing to do."" 2. When I read these words and think about the kind of people who formed that particular generation of Americans I have to ask the question....Where are the people today who have that kind of character?"
Genesis 1:1,"('God', 'Creator')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational, In this text we notice that: 1. God created two things: (a). Heaven (b). Earth 2. With God being the creator of both heaven and earth that means thag he is in charge of both heaven and earth. 3. No one on this earth can destory what God creates. Even if someone tries to destroy anything it will only come back bigger and better.
2 Timothy 2:15,"('Study Bible', 'Closer To God')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational, When we do as instructed to do in 2 Timothy 2:15 we: 1. Become wiser according to the word of God. 2. Become stronger mentally and spiritually. 3. Get closer to God and we began to know the difference between God's voice and the Devil's voice.
Revelation 6:9-11,"('Beasts Of Revelation', 'Fifth Seal', 'Under The Alter')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 10/29/2015 Title : (18) Fifth Seal: The Martyrs Under the Altar (Revelation 6:9-11) Revelation 6:9-11 (KJV) 9 And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: 10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? 11 And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled. Introduction Let me point out that when the fifth seal is removed, the scene changes completely. Each of the first four seals is characterized by a living creature and a horse, neither of which appears under the last three seals. Thus the first four seals are set apart from the last three. Matthew 5:13 tells us that born again believers are the ""salt of the earth."" Matthew 5:14 tells us they are also the ""light of the world."" The presence of the Church (believers) in the world preserves the earth, wards off corruption and holds back the terrible judgment of Almighty God. Regardless of how unworthy and faulty we may be as believers, we are the salt that keeps civilization from rotting on its feet. But when God's patience runs out and He removes the salt and the light, corruption and moral darkness will then engulf this earth (Isaiah 60:2). When the Rapture takes place the salt and the light will be taken out. The Holy Ghost will also go out with the Church (born again believers), because believers are the home of the Spirit on earth-- ""Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in your midst?"" (1 Corinthians 3:16). Christ by His Spirit dwells in all true believers. When the Rapture takes place the Church (believers) will be caught up to meet Jesus in the air and will be presented by Christ to Himself in Glory-- ""And to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless"" (Ephesians 5:27). Christ both gives and takes the bride (His church); He presents her to himself. The Spirit will go out with the Church (believers) and will then work from Heaven to earth as He did in the Old Testament era. In those days the Holy Ghost came upon men, and then left them; but since Pentecost He has been in the world to stay. He has not departed for one moment. The breaking of the fifth seal reveals clearly that some on earth will turn to God after the Church has been translated. There will be those saved during the tribulation, but they will pay with their lives. The first witnesses on earth after the Rapture will go through the world preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom-- ""And the Good News I have shared about God's kingdom will be told throughout the world. It will be spread to every nation. Then the end will come"" (Matthew 24:14). The result of their preaching is made known in Matthew 25:31-46. These first preachers of the Gospel of the Kingdom will be chiefly the converted Jews ""These my brethren"" in Matthew 25:40 refers to the Jewish brethren of our Lord according to the flesh."
1 Corinthians 13:1-13,"('Love', 'Excellent Way')",Pentecostal," LOVE: THE MOST EXCELLENT WAY Study Text: 1 Corinthians 13: 1- 13 Introduction: - It is reasonable to conclude than that of all the ambitions that can arise from faith in Christ, the most excellent is the pursuit of love that is patterned after God himself. - A pattern that we see most clearly in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ, for love of his own, made himself nothing in order to make us something. - If the church is busying herself with this goal in all of its endeavours, then the world will have a vision of God. - This most excellent way is the road, that if travelled, a person will find significance, blessing and meaning. - And it can be walked since God has placed his love in the hearts of every believer through faith in Jesus Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit. In this love of God we make the transition from being nothing to something. - We shall discuss the topic under three sub-headings: 1. The Priority of Love 2. The Properties of Love 3. The Permanency of Love - Love must first be expressed before the exercise of spiritual gifts 1Cor 13:1-2 - Love must first be expressed before the exercise of great sacrifice. 1Cor 13:3. - Without love, such things are of no value. Without love, any ability we have is of little value (such as teaching, preaching, etc.) - Without love, any knowledge we obtain will only hurt us. Without love, any service rendered is not pleasing to God. - Love must truly be given the highest priority in all our life endeavours and activities. - The various properties of Love is described for us. They include what Love is or does, and what Love is not or does not do. A. What Love is or Does: 1. Suffers longs - endures slights and wrongs patiently and long, like God Himself (Psalm 103:8) 2. Is kind - obliging, willing to help or assist 3. Rejoices in the truth - truth is personified as is love, and when love sees truth manifested in the lives of others, love greatly rejoices along with it 3John 3-4. 4. Bears all things - it covers and protects.it can also mean to endure, suffer. Thus in regards to the sins or failings of others, there is willingness to bear with them patiently. 5. Believes all things - in regard to the conduct of others, there is a disposition to put the best construction on it; to believe that they may be actuated by good motives, and that they intend no injury - There is a willingness to suppose, as far as can be, that what is done is done consistently with friendship, good feeling, and virtue. - Love produces this, because it rejoices in the happiness and virtue of others, and will not believe the contrary except on undeniable evidence. 6. Hopes all things - that all will turn out well. This must also refer to the conduct of others; and it means, that however dark may be appearances; how much so ever there may be to produce the fear that others are actuated by improper motives or are bad people, yet that there is a ""hope"" that matters may be explained and made clear. - Love will ""hold on to this hope"" until all possibility of such a result has vanished and it is compelled to believe that the conduct is not susceptible of a fair explanation."
"Numbers 13:27-33, 2 Timothy 1:7","('Fear', 'Fear Breeds Fear', 'Trapped In Fear')",Assembly Of God," THE RUT OF SAMENESS? MAY WE IDENTIFY WHAT HINDERS? By Wade Martin Hughes, Sr. Kyfingers@aol.com This is part #1 of a two part series on THE RUT OF SAMENESS, FEAR HINDERS... 2 Timothy 1:7 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. MUCH OF LIFE IS ABOUT DAILY CHOICES... CHOICE NOT CHANCE OR DESTINY WILL DETERMINE MY LIFE JOURNEY. I CAN NOT CONTROL WHAT HAPPENS TO ME, BUT I CAN MAKE THE CHOICE OF HOW I WILL HANDLE WHAT HAPPENS TO ME... WHAT IS HINDERING YOU FROM BECOMING WHAT GOD HAS DESIGNED FOR YOU? It might be hard for God to lead and guide you without you making a plan and exerting the effort where are you going? How you going to get there? You can't live a good life my straddling the fences. Deuteronomy 30:19 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live: MY CHOICE IS: MAYBE AND THAT IS MY FINAL ANSWER!!! When Linda and I were young adults we had a life changing experience. In 1976 we had our first son, and another son in 1978. Our life was forever changed. I made the decision to stop traveling on the road playing music. (This choice was not my own? Situations and circumstances kind of forced this upon me.) So I became more focused on the local church. These events forever changed us as individuals and as a couple. So becoming a FATHER CHANGED MY DIRECTION AND PURPOSE of my heart. I focused on MY FAMILY, teaching school and a jail/prison ministry. But I paid some STUPID TAXES... AS A YOUNG FATHER OUR BABIES NEVER CAME WITH AN INSTRUCTION BOOK. BUT SOME OF MY GREATEST STUPID TAXES WERE EXTRACTED BECAUSE OF MY ATTITUDES. I SAW MY SONS AS BABY --- NEVER EVER TO I LOOK AHEAD TO SEE MY SONS AS MEN, GROWN MEN. NEVER DID I SEE MY LITTLE SONS AS SPOUSES! I NEVER LOOKED FAR ENOUGH AHEAD TO SEE MY LITTLE SONS AS FATHERS! AS I LOOK BACK ON OUR JOURNEY I SEE MY FAILURES TO SEE TODAY AND NEVER LOOK AHEAD ENOUGH TO SOW THE PROPER SEEDS. I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THEM GROWING UP. I WISH I HAD MADE SOME DIFFERENT CHOICES? My sons and five grandchildren are one of our greatest joys in life. We watched them grow and learn and they became part of our praise and worship team. BUT HOW I WISH I WOULD HAVE MADE SOME DIFFERENT CHOICES ABOUT MY ATTITUDES AND WORDS AND ACTIONS. I WOULD HAVE WATCHED MY ANGER MUCH MORE. GREAT MEN OF THE BIBLE MADE SOME OF THESE SAME MISTAKES IN THAT THEY NEVER LOOKED AHEAD TO SEE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR CHOICES AND THEIR BEHAVIOR. --- WE MUST CHOOSE LIFE. Joshua 24:15 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD. May God grant us wisdom, understanding and discernment to be able to honestly evaluate WHERE WE ARE? HOW DID I GET HERE? THEN LORD HELP US DEVELOP A PLAN AND LAUNCH THAT THAT PLAN TO GET US WHERE WE DESIRE TO BE?"
Galatians 5:1-12,"('Faith', 'Freedom', 'Law', 'Legalism')",Evangelical Free," One morning, during an adult Sunday school class, a pastor in San Angelo, Texas, picked up the podium and walked back and forth with it. When someone asked, ""What are you doing?"" he replied, ""Well, sometimes you just need to take a stand."" (Rebecca Livermore, San Angelo, Texas, ""Lite Fare,"" Christian Reader) That's where we've come this morning in our study of Galatians. We've talked theology through the first four chapters, and it has become very clear in our minds that we are free from the Law; we are free from the pressure to perform in order to find acceptance with God; we are free to enjoy the unconditional love and blessing of our Lord. We know all this in our minds, but now it is time to take a stand on it in our hearts, because there are those who would try to convince us otherwise; there are those who would try to knock us down; and there are those who would try to enslave us all over again to their expectations and legalistic systems. If you have your Bibles, I invite you to turn with me to Galatians 5, Galatians 5, where God tells us how to deal with these enemies of our freedom. Galatians 5:1 For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery. (ESV) In other words, Christ set you free, so... STAY FREE! Don't let yourself be enslaved all over again. Don't let anybody or anything put you in bondage again. Before he got out of prison this last February (2016), 69-year-old Albert Woodfox had spent 43 years in an isolation cell. He had set a record, having spent the longest time in solitary confinement of any prisoner in America. He had no view of the sky from inside his 6 foot by 9 foot concrete box, no human contact, and taking a walk meant pacing from one end of the cell to the other and back again. Two months after he was released (April, 2016) Woodfox found himself on a beach in Galveston, Texas, with a friend. He marveled at all the beachgoers under a cloudless sky. Then he stared out over the Gulf of Mexico as it stretched far out to the horizon. He said. ""It was so strange, walking on the beach and all these people and kids running around."" After over four decades of solitary confinement, you'd think Woodfox would be glad to be out in the open. However, two months after the state of Louisiana set him free, he said he sometimes wishes he was back in that cell. Someone asked him if he missed his life in lockdown, to which Woodfox passionately replied, ""Oh yeah! Yeah!"" Then he explained, ""Human beings... feel more comfortable in areas they are secure. In a cell, you have a routine, you pretty much know what is going to happen, when it's going to happen, but in society it's difficult, it's looser. So there are moments when, yeah, I wish I was back in the security of a cell."" (Ed Pilkington, ""43 years in solitary: There are moments I wish I was back there,"" The Guardian, 4-29-16; www.PreachingToday.com) I'm afraid that describes the sentiment of some believers I know. They prefer the security of confinement. They prefer the security of a routine, knowing what they're supposed to do and when they're supposed to do it. They prefer the security of rules, which define what is acceptable and what is not."
Matthew 6:1-18,"('Forgiveness', 'Peace', 'Breakthrough', 'Jail', 'Forgiveness General')",Baptist," ""Get out of jail, Free"" Matthew 6:1-18 Medical science has been telling us now for years that there is a very close relationship between physical illness and stress. That shouldn't be hard for us to believe since when you go through a time of extended stress and difficulty, many times we become physically sick. I read this week in fact that it is possible that up to 80% of those who are currently hospitalized have a stress related illnesses. 80%. Hospital chaplains have noticed also that many times there is a strong connection between the physical and spiritual. Jesus obviously knew this and we see this teaching being applied in the gospel of Matthew... Chapter 9. A man who was paralyzed is brought to Jesus on a mat. Jesus heals the man and the Bible says that he jumped up and went home. Amazing. But if you read the passage too quickly you will miss the words Jesus spoke to bring healing to the man. Here they are. Jesus said, be encouraged my child, your sins are forgiven. Interesting words to speak to heal someone. Yet the words, your sins are forgiven are possibly the most powerful words we can speak to someone who has hurt us... Offended us, damaged us in any way. Jesus teaches on this topic of forgiveness on numerous occasions and the results are always powerful. In Matthew chapter 6, he addresses the topic again and it is here that He tells us how to pray and He concludes with a powerful statement about forgiveness. We need to look at all of these verses to fully understand what Jesus was saying. There are actually at least four topics he addresses here... Giving, praying, forgiving and fasting and He addresses them in that order. I want to look at each one briefly but want to focus on the topic of forgiveness. Because these topics have a definite connection. (1) When you give, give with the right attitude. It would be easy for me as your pastor to simply say, ""I don't really care how you give, just as long as you give"" but that's not what the Bible teaches. When you give you must give with the right attitude. Here is the principle. When you give, give privately, not publicly. Jesus is letting us know right off the bat that if we give for the purpose of being seen by others, to impress someone, to make some kind of righteous appearance-you will have no reward in heaven. This word reward runs through this passage like a red thread shows up on white material... In other words it is very obvious. Seven times we will see it today. It is a definite theme and it is the theme that seems to connect these passages. I don't think most of us give expecting a reward but Jesus makes it clear that if we give with the right attitude there will be one. Notice two things he tells us specifically not to do when we give. "" Don't give for public applause. "" Don't tell others about your giving. Give in private. In Jesus day, right at the entrance to the temple there were large metal containers, like a box, used to collect monetary gifts. The box had a type of funnel at the top, larger at the opening than at the bottom. It was made of metal. So if you were skilled and knew how to toss that coin in just the right way, it would ring out like a trumpet, as Jesus mentions here in verse two. It was very loud. Never give for the applause or approval of others. ""Then,"" He says, ""don't tell others."" Give privately. Don't let others know how much you are giving. Give in secret. Then Jesus says and only then, will you be rewarded."
"Revelation 3:20, 2 Corinthians 1:1-24","('Salvation', 'Promises Of God', 'Partnering With God', 'Seekers')",Church Of God," God's Invitation to Us Lakewood | Speaker: Pastor Jonathan Vorce | 1-8-2017 Revelation 3:20 Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. Introduction: God is inviting us to a higher level of living... I. Invited to Participate in God's Promise A. He is the God of all comfort even in the difficult times of our lives. 2 Corinthians 1:1-11 1. Paul & Timothy were communicating to the Corinthian believers concerning their stay in Asia where they were persecuted to the point that they ""had the sentence of death in themselves"". (V. 8-9) B. His Promises are Yea and Amen to those who believe. 2 Corinthians 1:12-24 (Read & Expound) 2 Corinthians 1:20 For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us. 1. The Promises of God are established ""in Him"" and because they are established ""in Him"" they can be manifested ""through us""... Because GOD LIVES IN US! II. Invited to be God's Partner Philippians 3:10-11 10 That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; 11 If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead. A. Fellowship - Koinonia or Partnership B. Conformable - to assimilate with (to be merged with Christ in death) 1. Making it possible to experience the ""Power of the Resurrection"". 2. This happens when we become born-again. We are ""raised in newness of life"". Romans 6:1-14 (Read and Expound) III. Invited to be God's People A. Abraham's seed and heirs according to The Promise. 1. The Promise is Jesus and all He represents! (Redeemer, Healer, Soul Sanctifier, Sonship...) 2. Galatians 3:15-29 (Read & Expound) B. I Will be Your God and You Will be My People Jeremiah 30:22 - You will be my people, and I will be your God Exodus 6:7 - I will take you as my people, and I will be your God Leviticus 26:12 - I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be my people Jeremiah 32:38 - They will be my people and I will be their God 2 Corinthians 6:16 - ""I will make my dwelling among them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Hebrews 8:10 - I will put my laws into their minds, and write them on their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Revelation 21:3 - And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, ""Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. 1. At least 43 times in the Bible there are references to God wanting a people for Himself! Psalms 90:1 - ...Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations. Closing: GOD'S GREATEST DESIRE IS YOU!"
"Isaiah 43:18-19, 2 Corinthians 5:17","('Forgiveness', 'Destiny', 'Moving Forward', 'New Year')",Pentecostal," So its a new year, and a new preaching theme, Discover Your Destiny... Is that something you desire to do this year? Our focus last year was on being a dynamic disciple, after listening to 12 months of preaching on that theme, has there been any noticeable difference in your life and my life as followers of Christ? Maybe for some that is an easy question to answer, perhaps for others its a little more difficult. So, let me answer the question for you: In some lives I have seen real change in the last 12 months. There is a real fire in their hearts, an eagerness to be all that God has called them to be. There are others where I have seen subtle differences in both speech and actions. Also there are those where there is no visible sign that they have drawn any closer to the Lord than they were before. Sad, but true. So, as we enter into this new year, I wonder if our new theme will have a significant impact in my life and your life this year. Are we prayerfully seeking to move forward into all God has planned for us? The truth is there are many things that can hold us back and stop us from becoming the person God has called us to be. Instead of seeking to move on and press into everything God has planned for us we can be hesitant, the prospect of change can be daunting to some, the idea of change does not come naturally to others, some people spend years living in a comfort zone of their own creation. And often, even though it is our fault that we are where we are, we will blame circumstances, situations, other people, bad choices, it is easier for us to attribute blame to anyone or anything other than ourselves for a lack of change in our lives. If we want to be obedient disciples of Jesus then we must choose to allow God to work in our lives, to work in us and through us, to change and transform us. To take us from where we were, where we are to where God wants us to be. Instead of living in the past, we need to live in the now, with an eager expectation of what God will do in each of our lives now and in this coming year. The old has gone it is a new year, a new theme, a new opportunity for each and every one of us to experience a fresh move of God in our lives. God wants us to move forward, to grow closer to Him, to grow in our faith and spiritual maturity, to stop dwelling on the things that have past and to embrace all He has planned for each and every one of us. Need an encouragement from scripture? Look at Isaiah 43:18-19 (NIV) 'Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past. See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland. Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past... Is there something that you refuse to forget that is stopping you from moving forward? Is there something that happened that put a bad taste in your mouth? Or is there something that you are holding onto that you refuse to put aside? God wants to do something new, something fresh in your life, what is it that you are holding onto that is obstructing God's will and plan for your life?"
Acts 16:16-33,"('Prayer', 'Trust God', 'Confidence In Prayer')",Christian/Church Of Christ," Title: Prayer: What Shakes When We Pray? Place: BLCC Date: 1/15/22 Text: Acts 16.16-33 [Screen 1] FAS: Television interviewer and journalist Larry King describes three farmers who gather daily in a field during a horrible drought. The men are down on their knees, looking upward, and praying the skies will open and pour forth a much-needed rain. Unfortunately, the heavens are silent, and the petitioners become discouraged, but they continue to meet every morning to lift up their request to God. One morning an uninvited stranger approaches and asks the men what they are doing. They respond, ""We're praying for rain."" The newcomer looks at each of them and shakes his head, ""No, I don't think so."" The first farmer says, ""Of course we're praying. We are down on our knees pleading for rain. Look around, see the drought. We haven't had rain in more than a year!"" The outsider continues to nod his head and advises them their efforts will never work. The second farmer jumps in and says, ""We need the rain; we aren't asking only for ourselves, but for our families and livestock."" The man listens, nods, and says he still isn't impressed. ""You're wasting your time,"" he says. The third farmer can't take any more, and in anger he says, ""Okay, what would you do if you were in our shoes?"" The visitor asks, ""You really want to know?"" The three landowners answer, ""We really want to know! The future of our farmlands is at stake."" The guest announces, ""I would have brought an umbrella!""

Last week we looked at why we pray. Today we are going to look at [Screen 3] what shakes when we pray. Let's go straight to God's Word this morning. [Screen 4] Acts 16.16-33. Luke tells us about an interesting incident that took place as Paul and his close companion and fellow delegate of the Jerusalem Council, Silas were heading to, believe it or not, a place of prayer in Philippi. As they walked along a slave woman followed them around. She had a spirit within her that allowed her to predict the future. Her owners thought this was a good deal and used her talent to make a good profit from the people that listened to her. For several days she followed Paul and Silas around and revealed who they were by saying, ""These men are servants of the most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved."" At first you might think Paul would appreciate the woman speaking about them but for some reason he became annoyed it says. I believe it was because the spirit in the woman was evil and was being used by the woman's owners to make money. Not looked upon very approvingly by God I am sure. (Just my thought). So Paul called upon the name of Jesus, in other words he prayed, and said, ""In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!"" At that very moment the spirit left the woman. A lot of people were around the scene and saw the spirit leave the woman. Of course the owners of the slave woman were furious. Paul had messed up their money deal. They seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities. They told the magistrates these men were throwing the city into an uproar with talk of this Jesus and advocating that the Romans should accept the practices of these Christians, not using that title in a very nice way I might add."

Philippians 4:10-13,"('Faith', 'Endurance', 'Contentment', 'Spiritual Strength')",Baptist," Peace through Contentment Philippians 4: 10-13 Our text today offers a compelling and intimate look within the heart of Paul. This letter to the Philippian church was penned from a Roman prison. Paul was bound, and unable to minister freely as he once did. The possibility of execution loomed each day. Under such extreme and desperate circumstances, it would have been easy to become disillusioned in the faith and abandon all hope. Rather than a man of doubt and hopelessness, we discover one who is optimistic about his future and quite content with life as it was. While unable to change his outward circumstances, Paul found great peace and joy from within. He determined to focus on the Lord and faith in Him instead of allowing current circumstances to dominate his existence. While our situation is much different than Paul's, no doubt we have all faced seasons of doubt and desperation. There have been times when it seemed as if our world was crumbling around us. In those moments, it is easy to question our faith and find ourselves feeling hopeless and alone. I do not make light of such encounters, but I am also aware that we do not have to allow our despair defeat us. Regardless of what we encounter in life, there is hope in Christ. It is possible to possess inner peace that overcomes the doubt and fears of life. One can learn genuine contentment, even in the face of adversity. As we consider the experiences Paul encountered, I hope they will encourage us in the faith and compel us to press on in our Christian journey. I want to preach on the thought: Peace through Contentment. I. The Gratitude Expressed (10) - But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity. Although bound in prison, Paul found reason to rejoice. His rejoicing was generated by: A. Philippi's Compassion (10a) - But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again. It is evident that Paul loved the church in Philippi. He had proven his love while he was among them, and he continued to express his love for them in this letter. This love and concern was not without consequence. The church also loved Paul. They were burdened for their former pastor and sought any means possible to assist him in his struggles. The church in Philippi faced financial struggles themselves, with many of them living in extreme poverty, 2 Cor.8:1-2. They were pleased however to share what they had with Paul. They willingly sacrificed what little they had to ensure Paul's needs were met. Epaphroditus had come to Paul, bearing gifts from the Philippian church, V.18. This presents a great challenge for us today. We have faced tough economic times for several years. While compared to the rest of the world, each of us are rich, but I understand the struggles many have faced. It is easy to lose our compassion for others and convince ourselves we just don't have anything to give. Paul and the Philippian church had learned that contentment was not found in great wealth, but in obedience to Christ. We too need to be a people of compassion, willing to give sacrificially of our abundance in an effort to meet the needs of others. Acts 20:35 - I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive."
Revelation 6:12-17,"('Book Of Revelation', 'Great Earthquake', 'Sixth Seal', 'Fall On Us', 'Great Day Of His Wrath')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 11/17/2015 Title: (19) Sixth Seal: Cataclysmic Disturbances (Revelation 6:12-17) Revelation 6:12-17 (KJV) 12 And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; 13 And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind. 14 And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. 15 And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; 16 And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: 17 For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand? Introduction Verses 12-14. The opening of ""the sixth seal"" precipitates a series of ominous cosmic phenomena: first, ""a great earthquake""; then ""the sun became black""; the ""moon"" turned to ""blood""; the ""stars fell"" to ""earth"" like ""figs"" in a storm (v. 13); the sky vanished as if it was rolled up like a ""scroll"" (v. 14; compare 21:1) and every ""mountain and island"" was moved from its position (v. 14: compare 16:18). Earthquakes were a common occurrence both in Asia Minor and in Revelation (compare 8:5; 11:13, 19; 16:18). A number of these same omens precede the day of the Lord in Joel 2:10 . . . ""The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining."" The falling of the ""stars"" like figs and the rolling up of the heavens ""like a scroll"" were predicted in Isaiah 34:4-- ""And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree."" These cosmic disturbances, both celestial and terrestrial, are a sure sign that the end of this age is drawing close, and that the martyrs will soon be avenged for their sufferings. Verses 15-17. These terrible signs on earth and in heaven cause all people on earth, from the highest to the lowest, both free and slave, to be filled with great fear. In their fright they vainly seek safety by fleeing to the ""caves"" and ""rocks of the mountains, calling to the mountains"" to fall on them so as to hide them from the ""face"" of God and the ""wrath of the Lamb."" They realize that ""the great day of their wrath,"" which no one can withstand or escape, has arrived. Commentary The martyrs cried, ""Avenge us!"" but the unbelievers on earth will cry, ""Hide us!"" The opening of the ""sixth seal"" will produce worldwide convulsions and catastrophes, including the first of three ""great earthquakes"" (Revelation 6:12; 11:13; 16:18-19). All of nature will be affected: the ""sun, moon, and stars,"" as well as the heavens, the mountains, and the islands. Compare this scene with Joel 2:30-31 and 3:15 as well as with Isaiah 13:9-10 and 34:2-4."

Job 1:8,"('Job', 'Suffering', 'Presence Of God', 'Enduring Suffering', 'Sermon')",Christian Church," Good morning! You know, I'm beginning to think the chapel committee is out to get me. Last year they asked me to preach on the wrath of God, and this year, I've been assigned the subject of suffering and the kingdom of God. What's more, they've assigned me the Book of Job for my sermon text. So, to review, I get to explore with you one of the most complex and personal issues related to faith, suffering, from one of the most perplexing books of the Bible, Job. How cool is that! Now, be warned, trudging through the Book of Job is an epic journey--one not for the faint of heart. The book could begin with a warning statement (like the space mountain ride). It might read something like this: If you aren't ready to think. If you can't be honest with yourself. If you don't have the humility to admit just how much you don't know. If you're looking for a simplistic answer to a complex question. If you ever asked yourself, ""Why don't squirrels have opposable thumbs?"" Stay away from the Book of Job. My message today is about Suffering and the Kingdom of God. Stated another way, it is about making sense of physical and emotional pain in light of the fact that God is loving and has limitless power. Now this is a question of a particular kind for an atheist or agnostic. For such a person, it is a part of the debate concerning the existence of God. But our focus this morning will not be that issue. Our focus will be on the how people of faith (""the righteous"") relate their personal suffering with the good intentions of God. This is an issue of immense importance because it is one that we will face. We will all suffer and we will weep in broad daylight for those we love who are seemingly being crushed under the weight of sickness, pain, sadness and fear. And we will pray for their deliverance. And we will wonder why God does or does not do all that we hope or imagine to intervene. And we will take it personally when the darkness of suffering chokes us and narrows our vision to a single longing for a way of escape. Perhaps you've already been there. Perhaps you are now there. Perhaps this is a part of your story yet to be written. We all suffer! Now Christians can be gratuitously dismissive concerning this subject--that is those Christians who are not clinging to life and faith while in the grip of suffering. They announce that Jesus has overcome the grave and that the trials of this life are transient (temporary). Someone will quote Paul's famous response to the hardships faced by the apostles in 2 Corinthians 4:16-18 (NIV): 16 Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day. 17 For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. 18 So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal. Of course, part of the answer to the problem of suffering is found in having an eternal perspective, but Paul is referring to hardships faced in pursuit of God's mission, not pain imposed on us for having the audacity to be alive. What's more, Paul responds to such hardship with the resources of God's Spirit and with Jesus in mind."
Romans 13:14,"('Heart', 'Putting On Christ', 'Our Hearts Vs Flesh')",Christian/Church Of Christ," The 3 C's of a Healthy Church - What We Should Wear to Worship Romans 13:14 (p. 790) January 15, 2017 Introduction: From the time I was little I loved wearing a uniform. I played little league and peewee football...I would shoot for hours a day in our driveway pretending to be Jimmy Dan Connor...or Goose Givens or Kyle Macey...I even wore the same droopy socks he wore so I could pull them up at the free throw line before I would dribble 3 times and shoot. A man named Jack Williams was my basketball coach as I grew up...I'll never forget in 1971 he bought us new black uniforms with white stripes and shiny satin shorts (and man were they short!) But I'd lay them out the night before with my Chuck Taylor converse tennis shoes so I could be ready to play on Saturday morning...I've got a picture...Want to see it? SOUTHLAND MIDGET A TEAM PICTURE We won the championship 2 years in a row...This was the second 1972...I have the 1971 ball because they played the championship game on the day I was fighting for my life in the burn unit...after they won they all signed it and gave it to me with ""Get Well Soon"" written on it SHOW BALL I love uniforms...I wore them in High School and in College...it was easy to tell whose team you played on...all you had to do was look at the uniforms...What you wore would quickly identify if you played for Southland, Lafayette or Johnson Bible College...uniforms make identifying the players easy...That uniform connects you to the other players on your team. So, what about the uniform we as Christians should wear that quickly identifies who we play for...what about the uniform we wear that connects us to our teammates? What should Christians wear to worship the King of Kings and to impact the world? This sermon is not about proper attire for Church attendance. God doesn't care as much as we do about dress as long as it's modest and decent. People love to judge by the outer appearance...God looks at the heart according to 1 Samuel 16:7. This sermon is about what a Christ centered life should look like, not just on Sunday mornings but every single day. I. GOD'S PEOPLE WEAR THE ARMOR OF LIGHT When Romans 13:14 tells us to clothe ourselves with Christ and to not think about pleasing the flesh...it starts with the word ""rather."" That word means ""the opposite."" Like ""I'd rather have the porterhouse than the vegetable plate. I'd rather you give me a hug than hit me in the face...I'd rather eat nails than pull for Duke basketball to win. So what's the opposite of wearing Christ in our daily lives? Well, Jesus is the ""light of the world."" So the opposite of light is darkness...The Apostle Paul says...""put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the Armor of Light""...let us behave decently as in the daytime...and then he lists 6 characteristics of nighttime clothes: carousing, drunkenness, sexual immorality, debauchery, dissension and jealousy."

"" There is the pits of desolation as a result of loss of Job "" Spouse has abandoned us, child is sick, some disability, a unexpected death in the family, Bank account is empty bills need paid "" An illness, a stupid decision one makes. Then we find ourselves like David in MUCK. 3. How do we get out of the MUCK? Muck Boot came in many different types remember, but there really not going to solve the miry issues "" Put on those Muck Boots and Step outside there you may put your mind on other things Exercise. Plant a tree. Plant a garden; Take a walk through the woods. Get on a mountain trail. Remember David said, ""I looked unto the hills from whence cometh my help my help cometh in the name of the lord. "" Sometimes we put on the muck boot of blame many times Our mess, we think, is someone else's fault, So how do we get out of the muck? Blaming others for our problem might be one way to do it. But we don't want to do that, do we? Because, although we think it might work, it doesn't.\ "" David in his miry muddy situation put in the muck Boots of Faith in God ""Me and God can deal with it"" [2] He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand. , "" We get out of muck by trudging through the muddiness of life "" We get out of muck by understanding we are never alone "" We get out of muck by grasping that the mud will go away spring is on the way! 4. Finally, David didn't really need Muck Boots but David kept his hold on God Charles Spurgeon said, ""A man may be as poor as Lazarus, as hated as Mordecai, as sick as Hezekiah, as lonely as Elijah, but while his hand of faith can keep its hold on God, none of his outward afflictions can prevent his being numbered among the blessed but the wealthiest and most prosperous man who has no faith is accursed, be he who he may."" "" David kept his hold on God by having a new song [3] He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise"
Matthew 4:12-23,"('Renewal', 'Redemption', 'Repentance', 'Righteousness')",*other,atthew 4: 12 - ," Theme: Repentance In this passage Jesus teaches us about Repentance - Repentance involves 1. Revelation and Realization 2. Redemption and Renewal 3. Reorientation and Righteousness INTRO: Grace and peace from God our Father and from His Son Jesus Christ who came to take away the sin of the world. In his inspired little book entitled, After You Believe, Dr. Nicholas Thomas Wright shares this moving story: ""James was in his early twenties when it happened. His life had been going along, nothing too dramatic, just the usual ups and downs. Suddenly, out of the blue, he met up with an old friend who was on his way to a meeting at a nearby church. James went too, and that very night, to his complete astonishment, his life was turned upside down and inside out. 'I never knew these things really happened,' he told me when I met him some years later. (""James"" isn't his real name, of course). 'When I talk about it, it sounds like I'm some religious nut, but it's the sober truth. I met Jesus! He was as real to me as you are in this room. All the old clichés suddenly came true. I felt cleansed, rinsed out, and more alive than I'd ever been before. It's as though I'd gone into a deep sleep and woken up in a new world, totally refreshed. I knew what people were talking about with all that God stuff before, but believe me, it all makes sense."" (page 1) What this young man experienced was of course what our passage deals with this morning. James ( we will continue to call him James) had repented of his sins and had began a new life in Christ Jesus. What this young man had experienced and was continuing to experience was/is the real reason that Jesus came to our world. Jesus came so that anyone and everyone could experience salvation. This morning, I would like for us to spend some time looking at verse 17. I would like for us to look at this concept of repentance. What does it mean to repent? What and who are involved? What does repentance do in our lives and what does it lead to afterwards? I. Repentance involves a Revelation and a Realization Have you ever met or heard of a baby being born all by itself? A baby born that was all alone? A baby that just popped up out of nowhere? We all have heard of babies being found or abandoned but never of one that just appeared out of thin air. Why? Because we all know that is not how babies come into our world. A baby has a human mother and a father and all babies are born with at least their mother being present. In fact, she has been there all along. She was there from the very beginning to the very end of the pregnancy. We may find babies abandoned, abused and neglected but all babies come into this world with at least one person with them. We may die alone but we are never born alone. Now, why would I be saying this? Because just as one is physically born alone, no one comes to faith in Jesus Christ alone. No one comes to repentance without the help of the LORD and co-partnering human disciples. + First of all, of course, is the activity of the LORD who is calling, directing and guiding. Long before we repent of our sins the LORD is already at work in our lives. We never come to faith alone. In John 16:8 the LORD tells us that part of the work of the Holy Spirit is to convict us of our sins. That means that the Holy Spirit is at work in our lives before we are even aware. The Holy Spirit is busy speaking, drawing and calling people to repentance and salvation. He is revealing our sin and revealing the Good News of Salvation. Leon Davis commented on Jan 29, 2017 The Spirit that teaches the ways of God is there when we come alive and accept God... but all the folks who came before to nurture that moment were of course faithful to that day they believe by faith would come. Like it was a forgone conclusion. We who must be faithful to carry the Light into the uncomprehending darkness must be the light, in the Light, of the Light. 
whew....I got it out...love your teaching...Leon

You are vital to our LORD and I know that the LORD is both blessing you and enlarging your ministry. Have a great week and once again thanks for the comment. "
Job 37:1-24,"('Breath Of God', 'Perfect In Knowledge', 'His Voice', 'His Work')",Calvary Chapel," Job 37: 1 - 24 When Thunder Roars - Go Indoors 1 ""At this also my heart trembles, and leaps from its place. 2 Hear attentively the thunder of His voice, and the rumbling that comes from His mouth. 3 He sends it forth under the whole heaven, His lightning to the ends of the earth. 4 After it a voice roars; He thunders with His majestic voice, and He does not restrain them when His voice is heard. 5 God thunders marvelously with His voice; He does great things which we cannot comprehend. 6 For He says to the snow, 'Fall on the earth'; Likewise to the gentle rain and the heavy rain of His strength. 7 He seals the hand of every man, that all men may know His work. 8 The beasts go into dens, and remain in their lairs. 9 From the chamber of the south comes the whirlwind and cold from the scattering winds of the north. 10 By the breath of God ice is given, and the broad waters are frozen. 11 Also with moisture He saturates the thick clouds; He scatters His bright clouds. 12 And they swirl about, being turned by His guidance, that they may do whatever He commands them on the face of the whole earth. 13 He causes it to come, whether for correction, or for His land, or for mercy. 14 ""Listen to this, O Job; Stand still and consider the wondrous works of God. 15 Do you know when God dispatches them, and causes the light of His cloud to shine? 16 Do you know how the clouds are balanced, those wondrous works of Him who is perfect in knowledge? 17 Why are your garments hot, when He quiets the earth by the south wind? 18 With Him, have you spread out the skies, strong as a cast metal mirror?19 ""Teach us what we should say to Him, For we can prepare nothing because of the darkness. 20 Should He be told that I wish to speak? If a man were to speak, surely he would be swallowed up. 21 Even now men cannot look at the light when it is bright in the skies, When the wind has passed and cleared them. 22 He comes from the north as golden splendor; With God is awesome majesty. 23 As for the Almighty, we cannot find Him; He is excellent in power, In judgment and abundant justice; He does not oppress. 24 Therefore men fear Him; He shows no partiality to any who are wise of heart."" Many times when someone has a discussion you will receive bits on information flash into your thoughts. Are these from God? Or are these just incidents of your past that has been triggered by certain stimuli. I suggest it can be both. Picture with me that you are a bystander who is listening to these 5 men argue back and forth. You are out in an open field. Now as Elihu has taken center stage in the discussion the wind starts to pick up. In the distance you can hear thunder and some flashes in the sky which in a southern section is turning a scary black. Partially you keep an ear and eye on the conversations while with the other eye and ear you are fixed on the approaching storm. You have seen the light flashes and begin to start counting until you hear the drum roll of thunder. Why are you doing this? You are trying to estimate how far this menacing danger is away before you need to run for shelter."
Mark 5:24-34,"('Hunger For God', 'Desperation')",Assembly Of God," GRASPING THE INVISIBLE Mark 5:24-34 INTRODUCTION A. HUMOR - Loyalty Tested 1. The instructor from a dog training workshop in Salt Lake City noted that a dog's loyalty can be tested by the owner. 2. If the owner will fall down and pretend to be hurt, a dog with a bad temper will tend to bite him. A good dog will show concern, and may lick the fallen owner's face. 3. Susan Matice attended the class and then decided to test her two dogs. While eating pizza in her living room, she stood up, clutched her heart, screamed and fell to the floor. 4. Her two dogs looked at her, and then they looked at each other, and then they raced to the coffee table for her pizza. -- Associated Press, 1-17-91. B. THE TEXT Mark 5:24 A large crowd followed and pressed around him. 25 And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years. 26 She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse. 27 When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, 28 because she thought, ""If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed."" 29 Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering. 30 At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, ""Who touched my clothes?"" 31 ""You see the people crowding against you,"" his disciples answered, ""and yet you can ask, 'Who touched me?' "" 32 But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it. 33 Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth. 34 He said to her, ""Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering."" C. THESIS 1. Is it good enough to be near Christ? Why is it that this woman was the only one who touched Jesus? 2. We're looking at the 4 types of people around Jesus, the secret of this woman's faith, and why Jesus called her out. 3. The title of this message is ""Grasping The Invisible."" I. THE CROWD AROUND JESUS The crowd that around Jesus (and every church crowd) had a least 4 different types of people in it: A. THE CRITICS 1. These are religious people, but they have a bone to pick with those in charge. 2. They come with a negative spirit and have the potential of becoming hostile to Jesus/ the church. B. THE CURIOUS 1. Those who want to see ""the show"" or to see something they don't understand. They have no intent on joining the cause they've come to see. It's the Sunday A.M. crowd. 2. As a matter of fact, they DON'T want involvement, they just want information (or entertainment). 3. These people come with either a neutral or skeptical spirit. C. THE COMMITTED 1. These are people who've become convinced of the cause and are committed to helping others learn about it. They're actively involved in reaching out to others with the good news. 2. They're servants who want to help, even if they don't know how to help. 3. They come with a positive spirit; they're in favor of Jesus, in favor of the church and its mission."
Matthew 21:1-11,"('Worship', 'Triumphal Entry', 'Palm Sunday', 'Love  Of God')",Bible Church," Eyewitness to the Messiah Worship--as It Was Meant to Be Matthew 21:1-11 In this fallen world, we all experience some good news, and then some bad news. Sometimes they good news and the bad news comes at the same time. Here are a few examples of what can happen for pastors. Good News: The Women's Group voted to send you a get-well card. Bad News: The vote passed by 11-10. Good News: The Elder Board accepted your job description the way you wrote it. Bad News: They were so inspired by it, they also formed a search committee to find somebody capable of filling the position. Good News: Mrs. Jones is wild about your sermons. Bad News: Mrs. Jones is also wild about the ""Beavis and Butthead"" and the ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre."" Good News: Church attendance rose dramatically the last three weeks. Bad News: You were on vacation. Good News: Your deacons want to send you to the Holy Land. Bad News: They are waiting until the next war. Brothers and sisters, these good news/bad news situation don't just happen to preachers, they happen to everybody! No one is immune from both good and bad in life. And the same was true for our Lord Jesus Christ. This morning, we begin the review of the final week of His life, with some very good news, and a very good day, just before he would experience some very bad news and some very bad days. It is Palm Sunday, March 30th, 33 A.D. in the holy city, Jerusalem. It's the beginning of the Passover Festival in Jerusalem. It was one of the three feasts in Jerusalem each year which every Jewish male over 20 years of age was required to attend. Pilgrims were jamming the city--it's estimated that between 2 and 2.5 million Jewish pilgrims had travelled to Jerusalem to commemorate the great deliverance of Israel from Egypt, when the Passover Lambs were sacrificed as a ransom to save the first-born of Israel from the fate of the first-born of Egypt. It was the final plague among the 10 that broke Pharaoh and Egypt and allowed the Son of Israel to exit Egypt for the Promised Land. On this Passover about 200,000 to 250,000 lambs would be sacrificed in commemoration of that first Passover, but there was one Lamb, the Lamb of God who would take away the sins of the world, who was on His way to Jerusalem to participate in His own sacrifice, a sacrifice that would change the world, and eternity, and has changed many of our lives this morning. Of course, I'm speaking of Jesus of Nazareth, Israel's Messiah, the Son of David, the only begotten Son of God. And Palm Sunday was a good day, a great day in His ministry, because it was perhaps the only day in His entire earthly ministry that He received the wide-spread public acclaim and worship that He was so worthy of--He was worshiped as the long-awaited Messiah, the Son of David, God in the flesh. And so I've entitled this message this morning as Worship--as it was meant to be. ""Worship--as it was Meant to be."" I want you to imagine this morning, what our church would be like, what any church would be like, if we really worshiped Jesus in the way we were meant to worship Him. In the way that would please Him, in Spirit and in Truth, in every respect. What kind of difference would it make in our lives? What kind of difference would it make in our fellowship, our church? What kind of difference would it make in our community, our world?"

By Wade Martin Hughes, Sr. Kyfingers@aol.com This is part #2 of a two part series on THE RUT OF SAMENESS, FEAR HINDERS... WHY CAN'T WE SEE WORRY AS SEEDS? THE HARVEST COMES FROM WHAT WE PLANT. GOD HELP US IDENTIFY THE ISSUES AND CHOICES THAT WE ARE MAKING THAT COULD BE HINDERING US FROM MAKING PROGRESS? Life can bring us to the point that we allow worry and fear to hinder our progress. We can make the choice to focus on our problems and refuse to see how we are blessed. Galatians 5:7 Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? Our Text: 2 Timothy 1:7 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. HAVE WE EVER TRIED TO DEFINE FEAR? FEAR: an unpleasant emotion caused by a sense of danger, anxious, panic To be afraid of something or someone, to give place for worry, alarm. WORRY: to Mental distress or agitation, to think about problems, to feel like something bad is going to happen, to be upset, to persist in nagging or agitation. ANXIETY: fear or nervousness about what might happen, uneasy mind, abnormal and overwhelming sense of harm. HOW MANY ILLINESSES ARE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY FEAR, WORRY AND ANXIETY? God has a design for us to TRUST HIM and cast our cares on Him. IF YOU CAN'T CHANGE IT? --- WHY WORRY ABOUT IT? ANXIETY IS CRIPPLING AND WE MAY MISS THE MOMENT IN THE STUPID DETAILS... WORRY, FEAR AND ANXIETY CAN TAKE MANY FORMS... BEING TROUBLED, FUSSING, GETTING WORKED UP, --- THIS BEHAVIOR KEEPS YOU FROM COMING AND SPENDING TIME WITH JESUS... MARTHA HAS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY BEFORE HER. MARTHA MADE THE CHOICE TO BE A WORRIED HOUSEKEEPER RUNNING AROUND LIKE A CHICKEN WITH ITS HEAD CUT OFF.... INSTEAD OF BEING IN THE PRESENCE OF JESUS? Slow down girl... Luke 10:40 But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me. 41 And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: Slow down and enjoy the moment... Things don't have to be perfect. The house work can wait. Have a BOLONGA SANDWICH AND CHIPS! Luke 10:40 (MSG) But Martha was pulled away by all she had to do in the kitchen. Later, she stepped in, interrupting them. ""Master, don't you care that my sister has abandoned the kitchen to me? Tell her to lend me a hand."" 41 The Master said, ""Martha, dear Martha, you're fussing far too much and getting yourself worked up over nothing. Luke 10:40 (NLT) But Martha was distracted by the big dinner she was preparing. She came to Jesus and said, ""Lord, doesn't it seem unfair to you that my sister just sits here while I do all the work? Tell her to come and help me."" 41 But the Lord said to her, ""My dear Martha, you are worried and upset over all these details! MARTHA LIFE IS ABOUT CHOICES --- YOU CHOSE TO GET ALL WORKED UP ABOUT NOTHING, WHILE MARY MADE THE CHOICE TO DROP EVERYTHING AND SPEND TIME WITH THE SON OF GOD... WORRY MADE MARTHA MISS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY."

Tell Me, if you have understanding. 5 Who determined its measurements? Surely you know! Or who stretched the line upon it? 6 To what were its foundations fastened? Or who laid its cornerstone, 7 when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? 8 ""Or who shut in the sea with doors, when it burst forth and issued from the womb; 9 When I made the clouds its garment, and thick darkness its swaddling band; 10 When I fixed My limit for it, and set bars and doors; 11 When I said, 'This far you may come, but no farther, and here your proud waves must stop!' 12 ""Have you commanded the morning since your days began, and caused the dawn to know its place, 13 that it might take hold of the ends of the earth, and the wicked be shaken out of it? 14 It takes on form like clay under a seal, and stands out like a garment. 15 From the wicked their light is withheld, and the upraised arm is broken. 16 ""Have you entered the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in search of the depths? 17 Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Or have you seen the doors of the shadow of death? 18 Have you comprehended the breadth of the earth? Tell Me, if you know all this. 19 ""Where is the way to the dwelling of light? And darkness, where is its place, 20 that you may take it to its territory, that you may know the paths to its home? 21 Do you know it, because you were born then, or because the number of your days is great? 22 ""Have you entered the treasury of snow, or have you seen the treasury of hail, 23 which I have reserved for the time of trouble, for the day of battle and war? 24 By what way is light diffused, or the east wind scattered over the earth? 25 ""Who has divided a channel for the overflowing water, or a path for the thunderbolt, 26 to cause it to rain on a land where there is no one, a wilderness in which there is no man; 27 To satisfy the desolate waste, and cause to spring forth the growth of tender grass? 28 Has the rain a father? Or who has begotten the drops of dew? 29 From whose womb comes the ice?

Or can you guide the Great Bear with its cubs? 33 Do you know the ordinances of the heavens? Can you set their dominion over the earth? 34 ""Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, that an abundance of water may cover you? 35 Can you send out lightings, that they may go, and say to you, 'Here we are!'? 36 Who has put wisdom in the mind? Or who has given understanding to the heart? 37 Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven, 38 when the dust hardens in clumps, and the clods cling together? 39 ""Can you hunt the prey for the lion, or satisfy the appetite of the young lions, 40 when they crouch in their dens, or lurk in their lairs to lie in wait? 41 Who provides food for the raven, when its young ones cry to God, and wander about for lack of food?"
Ephesians 4:26-27,"('Faith', 'Anger')",Christian/Church Of Christ," INTRODUCTION "" VIDEO CLIP "" SLIDE #1 "" To soften the tension of the video... "" One day a lady in a brand-new Volvo had been driving around in a crowded car park, had finally found a spot and was just about to back into it when a young kid in a tricked-out Honda whizzed into the spot before her. "" As the Honda driver got out of his car and was walking away the lady in the Volvo called out ""I found that spot first. What gives you the right to push in and take it?"" "" The young man laughed and said ""Because I'm young and quick"" and kept on walking. "" All the sudden he heard the hideous sound of a car being heartily smashed. "" He turned around to see the lady in the Volvo repeatedly ramming her car into his. She caught his eye and said ""That's because I'm old and rich!"" "" Anger can be so destructive. "" Today we are going to examine a new way to deal with anger. "" In the video clip from the movie Fireproof, that scene plays itself out in many marriages today. "" One person does something that angers the other, and instead of dealing with the problem, they let it build. "" As I alluded to last week, over time, when our anger is not dealt with, we use the things that we allow to upset us to as bricks to build a wall of separation between ourselves and others. "" When things happen to us that we are not pleased with, we get angry, when we get hurt by situations or other people, we get angry. "" When we get in the checkout line at Wal-Mart, WAIT, too close to home! "" When we hit the 5-hour light at Target, Oh, boy! Never mind! "" When we do not get out way, we get angry. There are so things that have the potential to make us angry. "" This subject is one that is close to home for me. Down deep inside, I was an angry person. I could not stand to lose and I could not stand to be insulted or slighted in any way. "" Being angry all the time is not healthy and it can cause others around you to catch the angry fever from you. "" WE live in a world that anger seems to be the norm, and when one gives themselves to Jesus, how we to deal with our anger? "" What does the world tell us to do, to stay mad, to get retribution, to make the offender pay for making us mad? "" Today we will look at how one should deal with their anger. We will be in Ephesians 4:26-27 today. "" SLIDE #2 "" Ephesians 4:26 (HCSB) Be angry and do not sin. Don't let the sun go down on your anger, "" SLIDE #3 SERMON I. The emotion of anger is part of our life. "" Anger is something that even when you are in Christ, will be a part of your life. "" In verse 26 and in verse 31, in the English translation we see the word anger and in some translations, the second-time anger appears in verse 26 is translated as WRATH. "" What is interesting to me is in those two verses, where we see the word anger or angry, each one is a different word in the original text. "" The word in verse 31 denotes a turbulent, fierce indignation. Passionate outbursts. "" The second time the word anger is used in verse 26 denotes an anger accompanied by irritation and embitterment. It is a state of being quite angry and upset with something."
Mark 11:22-23,"('Basics Of Christianity', 'Basics Of Faith')",Pentecostal," In Mark 1122, Christ tells us to have faith in God. How can you maintain faith in God, (first, second, third), you: 1. Keep Believing. How do you maintain a God-like faith, keep believing by keeping Christ first in your heart, home and habits. Mt 6:33 says, ""seek ye first the kingdom of God of God, and hi righteous, and all these things shall be added unto you."" Putting God first, determines what God can do next. In Mk 11;23, Christ tells us to ""believe, put Him first in all areas in all areas of your life. How do you maintain a God-like faith, keep believing, put God first! 2. Keep Confessing. How do you maintain a God-like faith, keep confessing by allowing the Word of God and the Holy Spirit to mold, make, and mature you into a person of love, joy, peace, patience, gentleness, goodness, faithfulness, humility, and self-control, the fruit of the Holy Spirit. In Mk 11:23, Christ tells u to say unto the mountain, be thou removed, let your actions and words reflect a God-like faith. How do you maintain a God-like faith, keep confessing, live by faith everyday! 3. Keep Standing. How do you maintain a God-like faith, keep standing, and as Christ says in Mk11:23, and believe that these things shall come to pass. Remember that God is able to do the impossible, He's able to move the unmoveable, and He's able to mae a way wehere there is no way. Nothing is impossible with God! How do you maintain a God-like faith, keep standing knowing God is able! Concl: What is that mountain your facing today, keep believing, keep confessing, and keep standing knowing that with God's help that mountain shall be removed!"
2 Samuel 12:13-23,"('Prayer', 'Sovereignty', 'Sovereignty Of God')",Independent/Bible," What do we do when our world falls apart? "" We pray for God's help, and submit to God's will. We keep faith with God and believes that He is good and He knows what He is doing. "" Let's learn this from David in 2 Sam 12:13-23. ----------------------------------- Nathan said to David: ""The Lord has forgiven you and you are not going to die."" "" Verse 14: ""But because by doing this you have made the enemies of the Lord show utter contempt (for the Lord), therefore the son born to you will die."" "" Because by this deed you have given occasion to the nations around to blaspheme the Name of God, to scorn Jehovah. "" Therefore this consequence will come upon David - the child from the adultery will die. And the nations will see and understand God's justice. This is not a punishment for David's sin. "" The rightful punishment for adultery is death, according to the Law (Lev 20:10, Deut 22:22). "" And the rightful penalty for murder is also death (Exo 21:12-14, Lev 24:17, 21). "" David deserves to die on TWO COUNTS, actually. That is rightful sentence. But Nathan has made it very clear that God has forgiven him and ""taken away"" his sin. "" Jesus will pay the penalty of his sin and grant him forgiveness. "" But this consequence has to come to uphold God's Name and show the nations the justice and discipline of God against sin. ""The son born to you will die,"" Nathan declared (12:14). The child was stricken with a disease, and David pleaded with God. "" Not in one prayer, not for one day, but for SIX days. He fasted and prayed, spending the nights lying on the ground (12:16). What do you do when your world crumbles? "" David PRAYS PASSIONATELY for God to relent, for God to show mercy. Was he trying to fight God? Was he going against God's will, when Nathan has already said that this child will die? "" NO, most likely not, because we read to the end of the story and we know his reaction to the death of the child. David wasn't fighting God. He was pleading with God. "" David was praying passionately for mercy, asking God to relent, if that's even possible. He was praying the ""Gethsemane"" prayer. ""Lord, if it is possible, let this child lives. Yet not as I will, but as you will."" (cf. Matt 26:39). "" Jesus knew God's will too. He has come to the point at Gethsemane precisely because of God's will. He was heading towards the cross and that's how it would end. "" Yet he prayed, passionately, and overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death, the Gospel writers tell us. "" Finally Jesus said, ""My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done."" (Matt 26:42) PRAY PASSIONATELY for the need of the moment! Plead for God's grace and mercy. "" For how long? For as long as it takes. For as long as God's answer is pending. "" David prayed every day for six days, until the seventh day and he stopped. He stopped because the child died. "" He prayed when there was still this opportunity. He prayed when there was still a chance that God might relent. David said to the servants (12:22): ""While the child was still live, I fasted and wept. I thought, 'Who knows? The Lord may be gracious to me and let the child live.'"""
Matthew 27:11-54,"('Fulfillment', 'Access To God', 'Prophecy Fulfilled', 'Death Of Jesus', 'Trial Of Jesus')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," A REVERENT ACCOUNT OF A HORRIFIC EVENT Matthew 27:11-54 It is quite remarkable that two acts within Matthew's account of our Lord's judicial murder are passed over quite without the gory details which our modern culture seems to demand. Each is referred to by a single word in the Greek, each of which is a participle in a subordinate clause. Roughly translated they would be: ""having scourged"" Jesus (Matthew 27:26); and ""having crucified"" Him (Matthew 27:35). Perhaps we should follow Matthew's example of reverent reticence, and not attempt to describe something so horrific. Rather, let us look at his account within its own Biblical, historical and theological context. Let us seek to understand (if it be possible) the significance of this event for ourselves. 1. BIBLE Although Matthew does not use his usual formula of 'That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet...', this passage is full of Biblical allusions. To name but a few: there is the cry of dereliction (Psalm 22:1); mockery (Psalm 22:7); parting His garments among them (Psalm 22:18); vinegar mingled with gall (Psalm 69:21); and darkness in daytime (Amos 8:9). Jesus' silence before His accusers is reminiscent of the lamb brought to the slaughter in Isaiah 53:7; Jesus' death between criminals is His 'being numbered with the transgressors' (Isaiah 53:12). 2. HISTORY The religious leaders and the world government were in cahoots to destroy Jesus. The crowd who had cried 'Blessed is He who comes in the name of the LORD' (Matthew 21:9), was now baying for His blood and crying, ""Let Him be crucified!"" (Matthew 27:22). In order that we are in no doubt, they repeated these same words a second time (Matthew 27:23) - and took full responsibility for their action (Matthew 27:25). The Governor ""marvelled greatly"" at Jesus (Matthew 27:14). The Governor's wife, troubled by a dream, sent a message to say ""Let there be nothing between you and that righteous (man)"" (Matthew 27:19). The Governor argued with the fickle crowd that Jesus was ""free of evil"" (Matthew 27:23). Washing his hands and pronouncing his judgment that Jesus was ""righteous"" (Matthew 27:24), the Governor ""delivered (Jesus) up that He might be crucified"" (Matthew 27:26)! The soldiers mocked and bullied Jesus (Matthew 27:28-30). The passers-by railed at Him (Matthew 27:39-40). The chief priests, scribes and elders also mocked Him (Matthew 27:41-43). Those who were crucified with Him reproached Him (Matthew 27:44). Were YOU there when they crucified my Lord? We are all just as guilty. Yet that is not the end of the matter. 3. THEOLOGY The ""notable"" criminal named Barabbas (Matthew 27:16) could be any one of us. The release of this prisoner, and the ""delivering up"" of Jesus to be crucified (Matthew 27:26) signals the substitutionary nature of Jesus' death. Christ died for OUR sins, the just for the unjust, to bring US to God (cf. 1 Peter 3:18)."
John 1:29-42,"('Disciples', 'Peter', 'Andrew', 'Names Of Jesus')",Anglican," You have probably heard the phrase ""What's in a name?"" from time to time. Names mean different things to different people. In the reading we heard from John 1:29-42 a few minutes ago, we heard some of the names given to Jesus and given by Jesus. We heard the name John the Baptist gave to Jesus- ""the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world."" Deliverance from sin through the blood of a lamb, which was a picture of Old Testament sacrifices, prefigured the coming of Jesus as the Lamb of God. This lamb achieved the final salvation for God's people through Jesus' death and resurrection. His death redeemed us from sin, death and Satan. His death also satisfied God's wrath by making up for our sins. John's Jewish audience understood the title ""Lamb of God"" because they had sacrificed many lambs. This Lamb would be the final, ultimate sacrifice who would take away the sin of the world. As the Messiah, Jesus gathered up all of the Old Testament expectations about an anointed one who would lead and save His people. Another name that was given to Jesus is ""Messiah."" People had high expectations for a rising leader. John the Baptist thought that Jesus was the One...the Coming One...the Lamb of God...The Son of God...The Messiah. But a year or so later, John the Baptist had doubts when the Messiah didn't act like John thought Messiahs were supposed to act. From prison, John sent his disciples to Jesus with questions: ""Hey, I thought you were the Son of God. Why aren't you Son-of-Godding? Why aren't you thumping our enemies? Why am I still in jail?"" Another name we heard was ""snakes."" John the Baptist could look into people's souls and see who they really were. That's why he called the Pharisees and Sadducees ""a brood of vipers."" He knew they didn't want to repent. He also looked at Jesus and knew that Jesus was the Lamb of God. He knew that Jesus had the power to make things new. He knew that Jesus had power over sin and death. John used his influence to point others toward Christ, just as believers today are called on to do. John's message was clear: Behold! John the Baptist was the vessel chosen by God to prepare the people for the coming of the Messiah. God used John to open truths to his people that they can't understand on their own. Once we have been introduced to these truths, our teachers must hand us over to Jesus so that he can disciple us. We also heard the name ""teacher."" The role of a teacher of the Bible is to bring people to Christ. That's what Andrew did when he brought his brother Cephas to Jesus. Andrew is a good example for us to follow. Fellowship with Jesus doesn't end when worship ends. Fellowship should encourage us to share the joy we have with other people. Jesus called Andrew to catch men instead of fish, and that's the same call he has for us today."
Ephesians 1:3,"('Spiritual', 'Blessing', 'Union With Christ')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Scripture Last week I began a series of sermons on Ephesians 1 that I am calling, ""God's Supreme Purpose."" The Apostle Paul's emphasis in chapter 1 is not on what we must do for salvation, but rather on what God has done for us in Christ. Ephesians 1 teaches us that we have been chosen and adopted by the Father (1:4-6); that we have been redeemed by the Son (1:7-12); that we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit (1:13-14); that we have been given resurrection power (1:19); and that we have been given eyes to see the lordship of Jesus Christ (1:15-23). These are the spiritual blessings we learn about regarding God's supreme purpose for believers in Ephesians 1. Let's read about every spiritual blessing in Ephesians 1:3: 3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places. (Ephesians 1:3) Introduction ""The Mystery of the Missing Owner"" read the headline on an unusual section of the Chicago Tribune on Sunday, February 6, 2005. The supplement was actually a legal notice published by the Illinois State Treasurer's Office seeking to give money away to rightful owners of the contents of abandoned safe deposit boxes, forgotten bank accounts, security deposit checks, uncashed paychecks, and dividend checks. More than a billion dollars was owed to nearly five million people and businesses that the Treasurer's Office could not trace. The front page of the supplement listed the names and last known addresses of 10 individuals or couples each owed over $100,000. And what followed were 116 pages packed tightly with names from Lucilee Aakeberg to Leonard E. Zyzda - 113,000 names of people all owed more than $100 in cash and/or stock! It seems hard to imagine that people could be unaware of their rightful treasures. Yet, that is precisely the condition of many Christians. The Apostle Paul may have seen that in the Ephesian Christians too, and so he began his letter to the Ephesians by reminding them of God's supreme purpose for believers. And that began with an explanation of every spiritual blessing that belonged to every born-again believer in the Lord Jesus Christ. Lesson The analysis of every spiritual blessing in Ephesians 1:3 teaches us about our spiritual riches. Let's use the following outline: 1. The Author of Every Spiritual Blessing (1:3a) 2. The Recipients of Every Spiritual Blessing (1:3c) 3. The Source of Every Spiritual Blessing (1:3e) 4. The Extent of Every Spiritual Blessing (1:3f) 5. The Timing of Every Spiritual Blessing (1:3b) 6. The Location of Every Spiritual Blessing (1:3g) 7. The Condition for Every Spiritual Blessing (1:3d) I. The Author of Every Spiritual Blessing (1:3a) First, let's look at the author of every spiritual blessing. Paul said in verse 3a, ""Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ...."" These words begin the longest sentence in the Bible. In Greek, this sentence begins at verse 3 and ends at verse 14. Verses 3-14 are also the Bible's longest doxology. Commentator John Stott says, ""In the original Greek these twelve verses constitute a single complex sentence. As Paul dictates, his speech pours out of his mouth in a continuous cascade. He neither pauses for breath, nor punctuates his words with full stops."" He summarizes what commentators have said about verses 3-14, ""A gateway, a golden chain, a kaleidoscope, a snowball, a racehorse, an operatic overture and the flight of an eagle: all these metaphors in their different ways describe the impression of color, movement and grandeur which the sentence makes on the reader's mind."""
James 1:2-4,"('Prayer', 'It Could Be A Test', 'We May Need To Change')",Baptist," WHY ME LORD? Have you ever ask yourself this question when your life derailed. (1) James 1: 2 My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; 3 Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience. 4 But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. Joy because we know God is with. Teaches us to be patience. (2) James 1: 5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. 6 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. 7 For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. 8 A double minded man is unstable in all his ways. Unwavering faith. Bridle your tong. People who don't no what is going on because theirs is running. James 1: 9 Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: 10 But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away. 11 For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways. Acceptance of the allotments God has for us.. It has been God who has chosen us. People get so in the pace of life they for get God. (3) James 1: 12 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him. Take it and go on Got to stand your ground. Remember who sends blessings. He promises he will fulfill. (4) James 1: 13 Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: 14 But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. 15 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death. Know the source of temptation. The results of yielding to it. (5) James 1: 16 Do not err, my beloved brethren. 17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. 18 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. Know where all good things come from. Understand who is the giver of blessings. (6) James 1: 19 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: 20 For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. Spiritual hearing Deliberation in speech Lots of patience (7) James 1: 21 Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls. Turn from all evil Meek will receive the word. (8) James 1: 22 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. 23 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:"
Ezra 1:1-3,"('Restoration', 'Exile', 'Reliability Of Bible', 'Fulfilled Prophecy')",Baptist," Ezra: A First Person Reflection on the Exile, the Return, and the Future (pt 1) Welcome. It's good to see you! In the 2500 years since I lived on earth, I've enjoyed meeting my heroes of the faith. Some, like Barnabas and Stephen lived after I did, but I admired their work. Some, like Job, Caleb, Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael... (oh... you may know them by their Babylonian names, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego), some lived before I did, so I learned from their examples. Please forgive me for not introducing myself. I am Ezra. I am, by vocation, a priest and a scribe [Ezra 7:11], a record keeper. By avocation, I am a teacher of the Law [7:10]. I served the Lord during the Restoration of Israel, the most exciting time in our history since the Exodus. Both as a record keeper and a teacher, history is important to me. For some of you history may be a boring list of names and dates. Others may view it as a series of events. I like what English speaking Christians have done with the word ""history,"" defining it as ""His story,"" the story of the Messiah, the Anointed One, the Redeemer. I like that play on words. Too bad it doesn't work in Hebrew. For the devout among God's people in my day, history was more than just a series of events. It was much more than a boring list of names and dates. Our history was the realization, the unfolding, the fulfilment of prophecy. Fulfilled prophecy is powerful evidence for the Jewish faith under the old covenant and the Christian faith under the new covenant, a claim no other religion can make. It is powerful evidence for the inspiration of scripture, a claim no other book can make. In most of your lifetimes, Jehovah's Witnesses have tried and failed to predict the second coming of Jesus. In some of your lifetimes, they have tried more than once or twice. In a recent century, Joseph Smith Jr, founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, claimed to be a prophet while repeatedly failing the biblical test for a prophet. Almost 200 years later they still claim to be led by an unbroken, though repeatedly discredited, succession of prophets. Some people perform intellectual somersaults to find prophecy in the rambling verses of Nostrodamus. Their intellectual somersaults are more impressive than his rambling verses. Years ago, on New Year's Eve, broadcasters on one of your TV shows saved check-out line tabloids from a year earlier when famous psychics made predictions for the new year. As I recall, their accuracy ranged from a low of 0% to a high of less than 20%. They looked ahead only one year, into events already unfolding in the lives of people already known. I do not understand how those psychics became rich and famous failures with a faithful following. In the years since I lived on earth, I've had the chance to talk with Isaiah about his prophecies. Are you students of scripture? Have you read Is? What do you think is his most amazing prophecy? [take answers, which will surely include the suffering Servant of Isaiah 53.]"
"1 Corinthians 3:1-3, Hebrews 5:13-14","('Selfishness', 'Church Problems', 'Church-Hopping', 'Milk Vs Meat')",Baptist," Thy Will Be Done? I left the church I grew up in after 50 roller coaster years. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't because of the roller coaster that I left. I learned from that and gained experience and a wonderful knowledge of scripture and the importance of wisdom. It was because of the roller coaster operator who had problems with telling the truth; that was why I left. That is neither here nor there at this point. What I want to share is that in my experience with the church, whether Christians, or people in general, they sometimes leave their long term commitment with the church for the wrong reasons, or snap decisions that don't make sense at all. I am going to describe the wrong reasons people leave the church. May God's ""will"" be done. If you're planning to leave your current church to stop attending church altogether, please reconsider this very dangerous step. Very few decisions are more likely to cause long-term spiritual damage than leaving the church. Even for a little while. Because a little while almost always becomes a very long time. Even deciding to 'see what's out there' in other churches can be a dangerous practice. Church-shopping can become church-hopping, which easily leads to church-stopping. Christianity was never meant to be lived in isolation. We need you. You need us. We need each other. I remember an old story told by an old preacher; it went like this... ""There was a fellow in the church who got mad about something that took place within the church. Instead of talking it out and praying about it with the pastor and through council, the ole' guy just left the church. A few weeks went by and one evening as the ole fellow was sitting in his rocking chair and smoking his pipe, there came a knock at the door. It was the pastor. Can I come and sit with you awhile? said the pastor. If you'd like, said the ole' fellow. So in silence, there they sat for about a half hour, neither one saying a word. Then all of a sudden and ember popped out of the fireplace and landed on the floor. It was hot, bright and strong. The two gents just stared at it as it slowly lost its heat, its brightness, and finally went dark. As the pastor looked over at the ole fellow he saw a tear stream down his cheek. The ole fellow looked at the pastor and said, I'll see you on Sunday."" The moral here is that in the community of the flame (the church) we remain strong like the ember surrounded by the rest, but without our church family we slowly fade getting darker and weak and eventually growing cold. As we are being fed in the church, the amount we can take in diminishes until we do one thing: start serving. Expecting to grow spiritually by attending church but not participating is like expecting to get physically healthy by eating better but not getting off the couch. In both 1 Corinthians 3 and Hebrews 5 we read about immature believers who wanted more ""milk"" even though they should have been ready for ""solid food."" Often, church members will leave a church because they want meatier sermons. The truth is, most of the time those who are still drinking milk will choke on the meat. But, while sermons can always be better, I don't believe we can ever get spiritual meat from sermons, just milk. What makes something milk is that it's been through the cow. Someone else has eaten it, chewed it, processed it and fed it to you. Meat is something we ourselves chew on. It requires our work and participation. It must pass through us, individually, for us to benefit from its nutrients. (God's blessings)"
Acts 2:42-47,"('Fellowship', 'Community Of Faith', 'Commitment To Church')",Baptist," Connecting Acts 2:42-47 January 8, 2017 I wonder if I took a survey from you of what I preach about the most, what would you say? I'm not sure if you've ever thought about that. I actually never did until I started writing this message. I'm not sure if you've ever thought, ""UGH! He's preaching on that again? Why am I here!?"" It's like the person who comes to church one time and I'm preaching about giving, and the assumption is, they're always asking for money, that's why I don't come! I believe the focus or recurring theme always needs to be the Good News of Jesus Christ -- it's really the great news that ~ 16 God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through Him. - John 3:16-17 I believe this is the main point of scripture and everything flows out of this central truth - - -God loves you, He sent His Son for you, He died for you, because He didn't want to condemn you!! He wanted to save you!! Yet, the sad fact is many people, even Christians have a difficult time with this passage, as too many people believe we are reconciled to God on the basis of our good works, not on the atoning sacrifice of Jesus. After we move through the GREAT NEWS, there are lots of others themes to talk about. And as we start the new year, I believe two main topics or themes we need to look at - - - are community and worship. So, for the next 6 weeks or so, we will look at these two topics. About 3 weeks talking about the need and importance of community, what it is and why we need it. Then, we'll look at worship and ask and see what worship means for us. So, I want to look at a scripture we've looked at and talked about before. I believe this is the best scripture to describe what the early church looked like when it came to community. Luke wrote the book of Acts, and we're going to look at the last 6 verses of Acts 2. Luke tells us ~ 42 And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. 43 And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. 44 And all who believed were together and had all things in common. 45 And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. 46 And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, 47 praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved. - Acts 2:42-47 Church is not a social club. Sometimes we develop great friendships at social clubs, I'm not against them. But, the fact is, we live in a broken world. A world which is filled with sin, hurt, pain, injury, illness and ultimately, death. We often don't find the comfort and community we desire by going to a meeting, instead, we find what we need when we are surrounded by people who are like minded. We have to be intentional about cultivating these relationships and friendships."

Philippians 2:1-8,"('Humility', 'Servant Heart', 'Community Of Faith')",Baptist," Forsaking Ourselves For The Sake of Others Philippians 2:1-8 January 15, 2017 I'm not sure how it starts, but I know where it starts - - - we all like to think we know what's best. We like to think we have most, if not all of the answers. We're pretty free to give out advice and tell people what's wrong with them. We like to think we are doing it to help other people better . . . but how dare someone come at us and give us a few pointers about ways we can grow and develop into better people . . . at least in their opinion. How's that for starters!? And I'm not in a bad mood! I'm actually feeling pretty good. But . . . isn't that pretty true? We like to give advice, or what we would like to call ""constructive criticism"" but don't like to be on the receiving end of it. And generally speaking we like to mask our opinions and thoughts by the phrase, ""we are doing this in Christian love."" Or we say, ""God told me to tell you this."" Last week I started talking about Community. We looked at the early church and how they were formed and the fact that they sought to work together, to be together, to serve together, to have all things in common. Worship together, eat together, pray together. On paper - - it really sounds like a great place to be. It's hard to imagine there were any problems. But alas, people were involved and when people are involved, problems arise. It doesn't happen intentionally. Generally, it never does, because we don't recognize it and for the most part, we seek to do good and not harm others. But can we learn from the early church and can we learn from the current church from what God wants us to learn about church and community? You know the answer to that one!?!?! Of course . . . I believe we are to have the mindset and heart of Jesus. Now, that's a pretty difficult task! Jesus was and is God . . . we are not. So, we start out at a disadvantage . . . or do we? I believe one of the hardest-to-get, most-difficult-to-live-into, toughest-to-hold- onto ideas is this ~ A Christian lives for the sake of others. We don't always want to hear that, but I did not make this up. This is central to a biblical understanding of what it means to really be a Christian -- which literally means ""a little Christ."" Listen to the emphasis the Apostle Paul puts on this idea, when he wrote to the Christians at Philippi. And remember, Paul is in prison as he wrote these words. I'm going to read 8 verses, then break it down a little ~ 1 So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, 2 complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. 3 Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. 4 Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. 5 Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, 6 who, though He was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,"
Psalms 85:1-13,"('Revival', 'Remembrance', 'Request')",Independent/Bible," Monday, April 2, 1739, marked a signal event in the history of Christianity because it was on that day that John Wesley abandoned his reserve to preach outside the church building and, at Kingswood Bristol, took to open-air evangelism. Wesley's decision brought him face to face with the common people and ignited a revival the likes of which England had never seen. Regarding that great day, Wesley wrote in his diary: ""At four in the afternoon I submitted to be more vile, and proclaimed in the highways the glad tidings of salvation, speaking from a little eminence in a ground adjoining to the city, to about three thousand people. The Scripture on which I spoke (from Luke 4) was this ... ""The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted; to preach deliverance to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind; to set at liberty them that are bruised, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord."" Wesley had chosen his text with brilliant premeditation because it was the same Scripture with which Jesus introduced his ministry to the people of Nazareth. Subsequent history records that John Wesley lived out that text, bringing the gospel to the disenfranchised and needy masses of England. The following years also reveal that Wesley likewise experienced something of the rejection and disgrace that descended upon our Lord when he first brought God's message to his people. (Hughes, R. K. (1998). Luke: that you may know the truth (p. 139). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Books.) Psalm 85 is a prayer for restoration that is rooted deeply in trust in God. The setting for the psalm appears to be the restoration of the people of God following a great catastrophe--perhaps the Babylonian captivity (About 50 years after Jerusalem's fall in 586 B.C.,). With this psalm, the people prayed for a revival of their spirits and a renewal in their land. The ultimate fulfillment of their prayer would be in the coming glorious kingdom of the Savior Jesus (Radmacher, E. D., Allen, R. B., & House, H. W. (1997). The Nelson Study Bible: New King James Version (Ps 85). Nashville: T. Nelson Publishers.). Many of us live between memory and hope. We recall what God has done in the past with gratitude, and we hope that He will do it again. This makes present sorrow and discouragement bearable. Like losing a friend or loved one, we live with grief, sustained with a flood of memories from the past, which bring her joy. Although we must face living out the rest of our lives in this world, as believes we can know that the Lord will be there each step of the way and we can be sustained by hope of reunion beyond the grave. The day will come when depression will lift and the sun will break through the overcast again. But what can we do in the meantime? This is the issue before us in this psalm.

1 Corinthians 1:1-9,"('Holiness', 'Apostle Paul')",*other," In the eleventh century, King Henry III of Bavaria grew tired of court life and the pressures of being a monarch. He made application to Prior Richard at a local monastery, asking to spend the rest of his life as a contemplative (i.e., monk). ""Your Majesty,"" said Prior Richard, ""do you understand that the pledge here is one of obedience? That will be hard because you have been a king."" ""I understand,"" said Henry. ""The rest of my life I will be obedient to you, as Christ leads you."" ""Then I will tell you what to do,"" said Prior Richard. ""Go back to your throne and serve faithfully in the place where God has put you."" When King Henry died, this statement summarized his response to his high calling: ""The King learned to rule by being obedient."" When we tire of our roles and responsibilities, it helps to remember God planted us where we are and expects us to grow in holiness and obedience. When we in Christ's church are faithful and obedient God further sanctifies us, forming us increasingly in the image of his Son. I. INTRODUCTION 1. The apostle Paul spent some eighteen months in Corinth establishing a church. Some time later, he went to Ephesus and stayed there for a while. While he was there the Corinthians wrote to him asking him questions and sharing some grievances and concerns they had for their congregation. Some of this information was quite disturbing . . . A. Apollos, an accomplished Alexandrian Jew who was ""mighty in the Scriptures"" and learned at the feet of Pricilla and Aquilla at Ephesus (Acts 18:24,26), came to preach the Gospel in the footsteps of Paul (perhaps with greater eloquence). No problem here--but B. Other teachers, less friendly to Paul and with leanings to Judaism, also began to work. In a short time, the infant church split into parties, each claiming a teacher as its leader (apparently without the consent of that teacher). C. As dissension within the church intensified, behavior within the body deteriorated. Eventually, members of the church reported this to Paul, which caused him to write them immediately. His letter we now know as I Corinthians. TWM to chapter one. 2. You may consider the first nine verses of this chapter rather inconsequential: merely a greeting and some ""small talk"" to open the letter. I hope to convince you otherwise. A. The opening of Paul's letter establishes a framework for the admonition he must share, and in the next few weeks, we will come to understand his strategy. B. Of particular interest to us in this text is Paul's use of the word call (klhto\ß), a word he uses four times in this brief passage. Such use implies emphasis; therefore, we should take note of this in light of the context of the letter. C. I believe Paul used this word to establish the endearment and endowment of believers in the church, causing them to evaluate their behavior in light of God's expectation. [Are you living up to the life God gives you? You're endeared and endowed; now what?] II. A CALL OF ENDEARMENT (1:1-2, 9) 1. Paul: Called To Be An Apostle (v.1). Paul was not, of course, one of the Twelve. Yet, so important was his mission, so urgent his ministry, that God called him to be an apostle."
Matthew 22:34-40,"('Loving God', 'Knowing God', 'Drawing Close To God')",Pentecostal," Introduction: If you ask the average person if he loves God, his answer will probably be ""yes."" However, many people who sincerely believe they love the Lord are mistaken. Sadly, they may not even know Him. Words alone are no proof of love. In fact, we use the word love rather loosely, ascribing it to the most treasured people in our lives as well as our trivial preferences. Love is a major issue with God. When the Pharisees challenged Jesus to name the greatest commandment, He answered, ""You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind"" (Matthew 22:37). That's why the Lord should have such a prominent place in our hearts that our love for Him permeates every area of our lives. I. Misconceptions about Loving God. Tragically, many people don't understand how to truly love God. Even sincere believers can miss out on this awesome experience because of the following misconceptions: A. Mistaking the fear of the Lord for love of Him. We can revere God by recognizing He is holy and just, but that doesn't necessarily mean we have fully given our hearts, souls, and minds to Him. B. Confusing our need with love. Most of us are quick to bring our cares and concerns to the Lord in prayer because we need His help, but that may merely be evidence of our need for Him, not love of Him. C. Equating serving God with loving Him. Instead of being motivated by devotion to Christ, some people simply enjoy the satisfaction that comes with serving. D. Assuming giving is always a sign of love. If we simply put money into the offering plate because we've been taught to give or because we know we should, love for God plays no part in our generosity. E. Thinking that religious acts equal love for God. Singing, teaching, preaching, and sharing the gospel may not be expressions of love if they are done only out of obligation. II. Why don't people love the Lord? Some people say they love God but want nothing to do with Jesus. However, since the Father and Son are one, no one who rejects Christ can love God. John 14:1-""Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me."" Although the Lord's love extends to all people, many reject Him because: A. They don't know Him. B. They're afraid of the Lord's judgment. C. They're uncomfortable because their sin doesn't mix with His holiness. D. They don't want to alter their lifestyles. E. They think loving the Lord would inhibit their conduct. F. They feel uncertain about God and the future because they have no assurance concerning what awaits them at death. G. They can't understand why the Lord allows tragedies, natural disasters, wars, and accidents to happen. What they don't realize is that ultimately God has a purpose in whatever He permits. III. Why should we love God? The Lord is an awesome heavenly Father, and if we don't love Him, we lose out on the greatest relationship we can experience. Furthermore, we can't truly love other people until we first love the Lord because He enables us to love the unlovely. And the more we learn about Him, the more reasons we'll discover to love Him. Consider the many reasons we should love God:"
Genesis 26:12-33,"('Trust In God', 'Trust God', 'Dig The Wells')",Methodist," DIG THE WELLS Gen 26:12-33 26:12-17 Blessings are gift from the Lord The life of Abraham and the life of Isaac are more or less same. There was famine, both went to foreign countries. Abraham lived in Egypt so Isaac wanted to go to Egypt but God denied permission to do So(Gen26:2-6). He stayed back in the country of Gerar as per the command and the prophetical blessings of God. God blessed Isaac when he sowed the seeds. He reaped an hundredfold blessings. He became rich, he grew richer and became great. He had flocks, herds, and many men and maid servants. The wealth and the greatness was result of honesty, industrial efforts of Isaac. He earned in a rightful way. However, he became the object of enmity and faced the wrath of the local leader. So the Philistines destroyed the wells which he inherited from his father Abraham. Isaac was robbed, threatened and sent out because he became a stronger man. 26:18-22 Revival has long road Isaac revived the same wells and called by the same names. Digging the wells means the claiming of the ownership of the land. The meek would inherit the Land in God's time. The men of Lot fought with the men of Abraham, so he was blessed. The men of Abimelech fought with Isaac so he was blessed. Remember that content is a blessing to the Children of God, whenever people hate you, speak against you, content with you, hostile with you means you are under the grace of God. You are driven to the best if you are in the hands of God. Abraham was man of Altars, Isaac became a man f tents and wells. He understood and experienced God as protector, provider. He has plenty to give. Instead of wasting his time, energy and peace, he trusted in the God who created the heavens and the earth. He can make wells, he can bring waters, he can give prosperity. God appeared to him and told him that he would bless him(v.24). 26:23-33 God is your provision Isaac decided to live in peace, he moved out of the place where he had content, hostility and enmity. He lost the wells of His father, he had to lose the wells of Esek(contention), Sitnah(Opposition), Rehoboth(Roominess) and so on. Finally he was led to the place called Beersheba. This was the place he had walked with his father Abraham, where he learned the value of faith, obedience, and sacrifice(Gen.22:19). He had dug a well in the valley and found water. But God took him to the highest place. Highest place in the life. Isaac encountered the enmity from the non-Abraham groups, non-covenantal groups. The early Church faced the persecution from the Romans and the non-believing Jews. Whereas today the Church is crippled, ministries are stands still and Gospel is not preached not because of the problems of the unbelievers, heathens or the so called fundamental groups or the Governmental ordinances but because of our own people. The traditional Christians who are not born again, who have no fear of God who are indulged in all kinds of sins. The traditional values, theological understandings, interpretations are very important. Where we are in our spiritual life is important. How the early Church grew, how reformers like Martin Luther, Calvin, John Wesley took pain to bring life into the Church. A real study on their lives, on the lives of the churches of their days will bring enlightenment to us. Again how we are going to bring revival in our Church activities. The revival of the Church is lying within us."
Genesis 38:6-10,"('Family', 'Family And Faith', 'Divine Judgement')",Baptist," ""Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. But Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD put him to death. Then Judah said to Onan, 'Go in to your brother's wife and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.' But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his. So whenever he went in to his brother's wife he would waste the semen on the ground, so as not to give offspring to his brother. And what he did was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and he put him to death also."" [1] God is holy. We ignore this truth to our own detriment. He judges sin, always revealing divine justice. Though all sin is an offence to Holy God, and though all sin shall be judged ultimately, some sins ensure judgement in this life. Among the sins which God judges most harshly and most swiftly are sins dishonouring one's family. Such swift and terrible judgement speaks to the importance of the family in the divine economy. Throughout Scripture are found warnings against dishonouring our parents, against dishonouring our lineage. It is a serious sin against the Living God to dishonour the family. To realise the verity of this statement, one need but recall the fifth commandment, the initial commandment to be given with a promise: ""Honour your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you"" [EXODUS 20:12]. To dishonour one's parents is to invite God's wrath. To despise one's family is to incur swift judgement. The Wise Man wrote an arresting proverb that I required my children to memorise. ""The eye that mocks a father and scorns to obey a mother will be picked out by the ravens of the valley and eaten by the vultures."" [PROVERBS 30:17] Dishonouring one's family invites divine judgement--judgement that can result in death. Overarching this current series of studies of individuals whom God killed is a verse that we do well to always hold in mind. Whenever I am reading accounts of divine judgement, I always hold in mind these solemn words, ""These things took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as they did"" [1 CORINTHIANS 10:6]. God has provided such examples to warn against behaviour that displeases Him, against attitudes and actions that are unworthy of His people. Though undoubtedly there have been other individuals who were killed because they defied the Living God, among the first accounts to be included in the Word of God are two brothers--Er and Onan. These two sons of Judah should have stood in the lineage of the Saviour; instead, they were put to death by the LORD God for their actions. What can we learn from the failure of these two men to honour their family? Let's explore the divine text to discover what God would have us learn. THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL -- The deaths of Er and Onan did not happen in a vacuum; these two brothers grew to manhood in what can only be described as a dysfunctional home. Perhaps one could argue that all homes are dysfunctional to one degree or another, but the home in which these boys grew to manhood appears to have stood out for its lack of a strong father in the home. As a great grandson of Abraham, Judah, their father, should have been a model of righteousness; however, early in his life he revealed a bent toward the self-life. Though Judah's name is intimately associated with the Messiah, he didn't start well in life."
Revelation 7:9-17,"('Book Of Revelation', 'Blood Of The Lamb', 'Great Multitude', 'Living Fountains', 'Wipe Away All Tears')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 12/10/2015 Series: Verse By Verse Through Revelation--#21 Title: The Great Multitude in Heaven Revelation 7:9-17 (KJV) 9 After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; 10 And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb. 11 And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, 12 Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen. 13 And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? 14 And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 15 Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. 16 They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. 17 For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. Introduction We learned from the first eight verses that there will be souls saved during the tribulation, and that the first contingent will be (144,000) Jews. Here we meet another great multitude, but they are Gentiles, ""of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues"" (v. 9). This sequence follows God's plan, namely, ""to the Jew first"" (Romans 1:16), and then to the Gentile. This redeemed company, then, is neither Israel nor the Church. During this time of Gentile salvation, the Church is with the Lord, having been caught away by Him. She is seen ""sitting"" around the throne (4:4); these ""stood before the throne, and before the Lamb"" (v. 9). The number in this throng is beyond counting, as far as man is concerned. The exact number is known to God alone "". . . The Lord knows those who are his, . . ."" (2 Timothy 2:19). They are the Gentile converts won to the Messiah as the result of Israel's restoration, and of whom the Prophet Isaiah wrote (Isaiah 49:10-12; 16:1-3). This throng heard the good news of the gospel of the kingdom for the first time through the 144,000 redeemed children of Israel. [It is significant that this group, the 144,000, is only announced, not actually seen.] This ""great multitude"" of Revelation 7:9-17 are the ""sheep nations"" of whom Christ spoke in Matthew 25:31-40. The 144,000 witnessing Israelites will be persecuted for their testimony. They will be hungry, thirsty, lonely, in need of clothing, and cast into prison. But those Gentiles who believe their message will stand with them and minister to them so that it is to them Jesus will say, ""Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me"" (Matthew 25:40). This throng will be preserved through the tribulation, not kept out of it as the Church will be-- ""Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come on the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth"" (Revelation 3:10). I know of no place else in Scripture where these are mentioned. They are an elect Gentile remnant in addition to the elect of the Church and of Israel."
1 Corinthians 1:1-9,"('Holiness', 'Abandoning The Faith', 'Holiness And Life')",Lutheran," Have you heard of these new tech gadgets called Google Home and Amazon Echo? They are described as hands-free speakers that do your bidding. If you want some quiet music, for example, you just have to say, ""Play bedtime music for an hour,"" and it will do that. If you want to know who won the hockey game last night or what the weather will be like, just ask and you'll get updated reports. It shouldn't surprise us that there are gadgets like this. After all iPhone users have had Siri to answer their questions for a few years now. There are of course questions that tech gadgets cannot answer--questions that have to do with the meaning of life like ""Who am I?"" ""What am I doing here?"" and ""Where am I going?"" If you want answers to those questions, you'll have to turn to the Bible. Today we're starting a sermon series on the New Testament book of 1 Corinthians. We'll learn through these sermons that the congregation in the Greek city of Corinth was a church fully equipped. Today we'll see how the Apostle Paul said that they were fully equipped to answer life's questions. And we are too when we pay attention to what Paul had to say to these Corinthians Christians. Paul visited Corinth on his second missionary journey and stayed there for a year and a half. In spite of some opposition, Paul found many converts in this city, which may have had as many as half a million inhabitants. But being a Christian in Corinth wasn't easy. The city had many pagan temples. It was a commercial centre like New York and Hong Kong today so people were focused on making money. And it was also a seaport with a reputation for providing sailors with any kind of entertainment they wanted. So when Paul received word later that there were problems in the congregation of Corinth, he may not have been surprised, but neither was he discouraged. Listen to how Paul began his letter. ""Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes, 2 To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be his holy people, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ--their Lord and ours: 3 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ"" (1 Corinthians 1:1-3). Considering the many problems in the Corinthian church, which we will be looking at in the coming weeks, it would have been easy for Paul to berate his listeners. Instead he begins by answering one of life's biggest questions: ""Who am I?"" Who were the Corinthian Christians? They were called to be holy people together with everyone else who acknowledged Jesus as Lord and Savior. In other words the Corinthian Christians were not individual pieces of flotsam floating aimlessly on the tide of current events. They had been gathered by God through Paul's preaching, and had been sanctified, that is, washed clean in the blood of Jesus and now confessed faith together with many others around the world."
Revelation 17:7-18,"('False Religion', ""Antichrist's Deceipt"", 'World Powers')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," The Government To Come Revelation 17:7-18 7But the angel said to me, ""Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns. 8The beast that you saw was, and is not, and will ascend out of the bottomless pit and go to perdition. And those who dwell on the earth will marvel, whose names are not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, when they see the beast that was, and is not, and yet is. 9Here is the mind which has wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits. 10There are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet come. And when he comes, he must continue a short time. 11And the beast that was, and is not, is himself also the eighth, and is of the seven, and is going to perdition. 12The ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet, but they receive authority for one hour as kings with the beast. 13These are of one mind, and they will give their power and authority to the beast. 14These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and those who are with Him are called, chosen, and faithful."" 15Then he said to me, ""The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues. 16And the ten horns which you saw on the beast, these will hate the harlot, make her desolate and naked, eat her flesh and burn her with fire. 17For God has put it into their hearts to fulfill His purpose, to be of one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled. 18And the woman whom you saw is that great city which reigns over the kings of the earth."" We pick up our look at Revelation where we left off last week. Today we read about a woman, a beast with 7 heads and 10 horns, a lamb, and a harlot. What or who do they represent? The book of Daniel helps us better understand the symbolism. We also read about a ""book of life"". What is that? VERSE 7 But the angel said to me, ""Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns. There are differences of opinion as to the identity of the ""woman"" in chapter 17. Some say it's the Roman Catholic Church. Some say she represents a city The last verse in this chapter seems to support that view. However, the New Testament often uses the word ""woman"" as a symbol for a church. 2 Corinthians 11:1-2 Oh, that you would bear with me in a little folly--and indeed you do bear with me. 2 For I am jealous for you with godly jealousy. For I have betrothed you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. Clearly, the true church is ""betrothed"" to Jesus just as an engaged woman is to her fiancé. Ephesians 5:23-24 For the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is head of the church; and He is the Savior of the body. 24 Therefore, just as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything."
"2 Corinthians 9:6-11, Malachi 3:6-12","('Worship', 'Offering', 'Giving', 'Tithe Or Give')",Assembly Of God," Cor 9:6-11 (First of many scriptures today, teaching sermon- write down questions for the en"," Tithing on Trial! Coulee Community Church January 15th, 2017 A family came home from church one Sunday and after they had lunch they sent their 6-year-old son off to play. After awhile, his mother realized that they hadn't heard much from him, which any parent knows is a recipe for disaster. The mother got up from her recliner and walked to the child bedroom and listened right outside his door. She kept hearing small metallic sounds and jingling come from the other side of the door. Intrigued, she cracked the door a little and looked in to see her son sitting on floor with his piggy bank opened and a few dollars in coins lying around the floor. He gathered them up and put them in the handkerchief, knelt down and prayed silently, and then threw the coin up in the air. He watched them all hit the ground, frowned, and gathered his coin back into the handkerchief and repeated throwing them up in the air. His mom opened the door and asked him what in the world he was doing. The little boy replied, ""We learned in Sunday School today that we should give money to God for an offering. I forgot to bring mine today I figured I'd come home and throw mine in the air, and God would catch whatever He needed and I could keep the rest, but He hasn't caught any yet!"" As cute as that story is, it does highlight one of the common misconceptions about giving as an act of worship. There are probably few other topics that make people, including most pastors, more uncomfortable in church than the subject of tithes and offerings. I think much of this is because of bad teaching, some of which we will point out today Past scandals regarding misuse of church offerings Cowardice, fear, doubt, and unbelief on behalf of pastor to teach the subject correctly. This morning we are going to look at what the bible says about giving in reference to our relationship with God. We will begin with a section of the New Testament to keep in the back of our minds as we explore this subject. 2 Cor 9:6-11 6 Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously. 7 Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. 8 And God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work. 9 As it is written: ""They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor; their righteousness endures forever."" l 10 Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness. 11 You will be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God. Prayer We will go back to the scripture we just read, but first I want to lay a foundation of where this principle of giving as an act of worship comes from."

"John 3:16-17, John 20:21","('Servanthood', 'Sharing Christ', 'Blessing Others')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Sermon - January 15, 2017 The Way of Jesus # 2 - ""I Am being Sent By Jesus To Bless Others and to Invite Them to Follow Him"" John 3:16-17; John 20:21 Last week we began this series on the Way of Jesus by looking at the first marker of the Way of Jesus: ""I have begun following Jesus and I am Depending on the Spirit of Jesus for my journey"". We talked about the importance of, no matter how long we've been in the Lord, no matter how long we've been Christ-followers, the importance of circling back to this beginning marker - 'I have begun and I am depending'. This keeps us humble and realistic. It keeps us open to the Holy Spirit and open to God and others, like children. We were reminded that Jesus said that we must become like children in order to enter the kingdom of God. We are beginning. Because we acknowledge this, we also give ourselves permission to be nowhere close to perfecting the Christian walk, as if that were ever a thing. We are starting out. We are beginning. I'm just starting out, in the last year, playing the violin. I don't expect myself to be very good at it by now. Believe me, I'm not. That gives me lots of room to grow, to not feel bad about where I am. It keeps me open to learning, to studying to improve. And God gives us gifts to encourage us. Artin, our dear brother, is an accomplished violinist, and we've had the great pleasure of having him join us in worship a number of times over the past few months. To all of us, he is a blessing. He is actually incredibly skilled and has an excellent ear. To me, because I listen intently to his playing and am slowly, by osmosis, learning how he approaches the violin, he is a particular blessing. He doesn't know it, but he is my teacher, because I listen and I'm learning from him. God gives us gifts in each other to encourage us along the way. When we know we have a lot to learn, when we have some humility, we are open to growth and learning. And we also know that we're dependant on the Holy Spirit for our walk with Jesus, our journey with Jesus in this difficult life that holds much anxiety and suffering for many of us. We're reminded through this marker that everything is from God and for God. Remove the Holy Spirit, the breath of God, and we're literally dead in the water. Church minus the Holy Spirit is nothing. With the Holy Spirit, there is life and joy. With the Holy Spirit all of the promises of God are being made effective in our lives, preparing us for a much better life now, and for an eternity that is too beautiful for words. So this is last week's Way of Jesus marker: ""I have begun following Jesus and I am Depending on the Spirit of Jesus for my journey"". And this is this week's marker: ""I Am being Sent By Jesus To Bless Others and to Invite Them to Follow Him"". To begin to explore this, let's look at our key Scriptures that were just read for us: For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. God did not send his Son into the world to condemn it, but to save it. (John 3:16, 17 NLT)"
Ephesians 3:20-21,"('Faith', 'Vision', 'Strength', 'Purpose')",Baptist," A Vision of Purpose Ephesians 3: 20-21 The church at Ephesus was dear to Paul. His ministry among them spanned three years. The church there began with just twelve believers (Acts 19:7), but through faithful effort they experienced amazing growth. Knowing the success in Ephesus, Paul desired them to remain focused on the Lord, while maintaining their priorities. Our text today remains relevant for believers in every generation. Regardless of where we are in our journey with the Lord, we too must keep our focus on the Lord. It is easy to allow various circumstances hinder our labor for the Lord. These hindrances may result from struggles, adversity, or even perceived success in ministry. Regardless of where we are, and what we are currently facing, we must maintain our vision as we strive to follow the Lord. I want to examine the details of these familiar statements as we consider: A Vision of Purpose. I. The Source of our Vision (20) - Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us. In case there was any doubt, Paul again reminded them of their dependence upon the Lord. He alone was their source of strength and wisdom. He had provided for their redemption as He died upon the cross; He rose triumphant from the grave for their justification and eternal life. The blessings they enjoyed had come from the Lord. If they were to remain vibrant in ministry, they must continue to rely on the Lord, being fully submitted to His will for their lives. We too must be aware of our dependence upon the Lord. He alone provides the resources we need to continue in the work we are currently engaged. Were it not for the Lord's strength and provision, we would have nothing to boast in. He is the source of our salvation, our hope for the future, and the strength of our days. Every blessing we enjoy comes from His gracious hand. Every victory we have experienced is the result of His grace and favor. The growth we have experienced at Fellowship is not the result of our wisdom or effort, but the result of the guidance and provision of our Lord and Savior. Were it not for Christ, we would remain desperately hopeless, without direction. We must never forget the source of our vision! Rom.11:36 - For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen. Col.1:16-17 - For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: [17] And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. II. The Strength in our Vision (20) - Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us. Paul well understood the limitations of men. Although the desire may be there to accomplish certain tasks, the ability to perform it was lacking. These bodies of flesh lack the strength and wisdom to accomplish that which is needful. Many of the believers desired to see great things among the church, but they were unable to accomplish their desires within themselves. Paul encouraged the church to recognize that they were not responsible to provide for and sustain the church alone. Where they were weak and lacking, the Lord was strong and able."
Revelation 8:1,"('Seven Seals', 'Seventh Seal', 'Silence In Heaven')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 1/13/16 Title: Seventh Seal: Silence in Heaven (Revelation 8:1) Revelation 8:1 (KJV) And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. Introduction Chapter 7 was an interlude. At the end of chapter six, the sixth seal had been opened (6:12). Here at the beginning of chapter 8, the Lamb opens the seventh and last seal. The breaking of this seal produces a deep silence in heaven, a silence which is caused by the prayers of God's beleaguered saints on earth. But God holds up the entire process of judgment while He receives and weighs the prayers of His own. [That is one opinion, but not the one I and many others have put forward. (see below)] John says, ""And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour."" 1. And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. This verse is a continuance of the revelation (prophecy) which began in chapter one with the ""Vision of Christ among the Lampstands"" --a vision in which God speaks directly to the Apostle John of the end times. The first thing we notice is that ""there was [an intensely dramatic] silence in heaven [that lasted] about the space of half an hour."" The absolute stillness is even more dramatic and effective than the thunder and the lightning. This silence may have three meanings: It may be a kind of breathing-space in the narrative, a moment of preparation before another shattering revelation comes. There may be something much more beautiful in it. The prayers of the saints are about to go up to God; and it may be that the idea is that everything in heaven halts so that the prayers of the saints may be heard. Even the music of heaven and even the thunder of revelation are quiet so that God's ear may catch the whispered prayer of the humblest of His trusting people (see introduction). However, most likely, this is the silence of breathless expectancy, as all of heaven waited for the hand of God to move. The psalmist had written, ""Be still in the presence of the Lord, and wait patiently for him to act. Don't worry about evil people who prosper or fret about their wicked schemes"" (Psalm 37:7; NLT). The hosts in heaven had just worshipped the Father and the Lamb with a tremendous volume of praise (Revelation 7:10-12). The scroll had now been opened completely, and perhaps even turned over; and all of heaven could see God's glorious plan unfolding. Perhaps the heavenly hosts were simply awestruck at what they saw. This verse connects the first two series of judgments. The silence in heaven is striking, considering the extraordinary activity and noise in the previous heavenly scenes. Silence in scripture indicates respect, submission, and anticipation (Habakkuk 2:20; Zechariah 2:13; 1 Corinthians 14:34). This particular silence is, according to one commentator, ""silence before the great storm of God's wrath."" The seventh seal has no features of its own. Rather, it contains and serves to introduce the trumpet judgments."
Judges 3:7-12,"('Sin', 'Rebellion', 'Othniel')",Baptist," What if everyone did whatever they wanted? - Week 3: The Cycle Begins with Othniel Text: Judges 3.7-11. Pre-Introduction: 1. The book of Judges is a cyclic book. Obedience, --) incomplete obedience --) disobedience --) and ultimately judgement. Thankfully the cycle also demonstrates the wonderful grace and love of God... 2. These judges were not judges in the sense of making legal decisions or settling disputes...rather the term ""judge"" refers to a leader. God-called; God-empowered leaders...raised up by God to deliver His children from judgement. Introduction: 1. Today I want to share with you the story of the first judge...Othniel. His name meant ""Force of God"". He was the nephew as well as the son-in-law of Caleb. (Joshua 15.16. 2. Begin by reading the entire text; Judges 3.7-11. First, the story of Othniel ... I. Act One: The Story of Othniel begins with Disobedience leading to Judgement, servitude, and oppression- Judges 3.7-8. A. The word ""evil"" means ""bad or sinful"". B. How did they become ""bad"" or ""sinful"" in God's eyes? 3.4-5....They were evil because of their incomplete obedience and compromise. Dr. Bob Jones wisely advised ""Never sacrifice the permanent on the altar of the immediate."" Sexual gratification outside of marriage is like that....worshipping false gods to get along with your in-laws is like that. C. The Children of Israel were serving the Baals and Astoreths. ""To serve"" in religious contexts meannt ""to worship"". D. God was angry with them and ""sold"" them ....to Cushan the Doubly Wicked. II. Act Two: The Story of Othniel continues with God's People crying out in anguish to God for Salvation and God raising up a Deliverer- Judges 3.9-10. A. Isn't it strange how people forget all about God when things are going well. ""I'm all set."" B. But when things go wrong and life gets ugly... That's what the Children of Israel were like. C. When they had been conquered by this evil king from the north and served him for eight long years....they finally came to their senses and cried out to God to save them. 1. The root for this word ""cry out"" means to shriek while in anguish or danger. This was almost an involuntary thing, a scream of the soul wrenched out in a moment of great fear and turmoil. 2. This word describes a strong, emotional, cry for help. Ill: This has happened in America too, many times. In 1863 Abraham Lincoln wrote: ""It is the duty of nations, as well as of men, who owe their dependence upon the overruling power of God, to confess their sins and transgressions in humble sorrow, yet with assured hope that genuine repentance will lead to mercy and pardon, and to recognize the sublime truth announced in the Holy Scriptures and proven by history that those nations only are blessed whose God is the Lord. The awful calamity of civil war which now desolates the land may be but a punishment inflicted upon us for our presumptuous sins, to the needful end of our national reformation as a whole people...We have grown in numbers, wealth, and power as no other nation has grown, but we have forgotten God."""
1 Corinthians 13:1-3,"('Evangelism', 'Love', 'Communication', 'Gong')",Christian/Church Of Christ," Dearly Beloved, we have gathered here today to celebrate the love...is often the words we hear preceding the reading of 1 Corinthians 13. It is good that we read what has come to be known as the Love Chapter at a wedding, because it reminds us as we are uniting a couple in love for the rest of their lives just what that love looks like. But in so doing, we often gloss over the warning that Paul was writing to the church. Each of these verses proposes good things for Christians to be doing, but only if they are motivated by God's love. Because of the sermon series we're doing this month, the message today will focus mostly on the first verse. (read 1 Corinthians 13:1-3) For the month of January, we've been taking a look at some of the sounds of the Bible that are often overlooked. We started with the shofar, which was blown to usher in the new year, representing a time of atonement and fresh starts. Last week, Jeff taught us about the sound of cherubim wings and how they accompany the judgment and mercy of God. This week, we take a look at the sound of a gong. Now, the first thing that comes to mind for me when I think of a gong is an Oriental throne room with a large gong being struck to announce the entrance of a dignitary. It might sound something like this (play sound of a gong). But as I was looking for something to demonstrate the sound of the gong, I came across these attempts to play the gong, that some of you may recognize. (play there is a video of clips from the first season of The Muppet Show with Gonzo finishing the theme song with a series of mishaps while trying to play the gong). Did you know that this is the ONLY time a gong is ever mentioned in the Bible? So why would Paul choose this instance in this letter to illustrate his point with a gong? What imagery came to the mind of his readers when they read this passage? Scholars point to three possibilities: 1. The Greeks, including those who were in Corinth, built these large, stone, open air amphitheaters. In those days, you could sit in the nose bleed section and still clearly hear what the actors were saying. How could they do that without the skills of a sound technician adjusting the volume? They used gongs strategically placed throughout the seating area. The actors learned how to position themselves so that the gong would reverberate with the sound of their voices, amplifying their words throughout the theater. The downside for this is that it created a false, hollow sound in their voices. The result wasn't true; it came off as empty. So that could be what Paul was referencing here. 2. Another possibility scholars point to was the dual use of a shield as both protection in battle and a gong for sending signals or marching orders to the Roman troops. You heard the sound of one gong being struck a bit ago, now imagine being lined up for battle and having hundreds, even thousands of them being struck over and over as your enemy approached. I'm sure that not only was it painful to the ears, but would cause the earth underneath your feet to shake as well. Those who go with this option point out that it goes well with the idea of a clanging cymbal because that was often the instrument used in the same manner by the Jewish army of that time period, so Paul could be making sure he's covering all his bases in making his point to both the Jews and the Greeks that this is a sound of conflict."
Revelation 18:1-24,"('Government', 'Capitalism', 'Christian American')",*other," 1 Timothy 6:10 instructs mankind that the love of money is the root of all that is evil. Yet, our self-proclaimed Christian nation choose to exist as a capitalistic society. Understand, capitalism is all about profit and loss. In simpler terms, Capitalist simply loves money. More importantly, those who tend to be capitalistic in their thinking desire to become rich and powerful to gain control over the world. As the resut of trying to be good Christian Americans, most churchgoers have become bewitched into believing in and following the false doctrine produced by our capitalistic principalites. Although most of America's religious organizations acknowledges our connections to God and briefs its membership about the way of Jesus, the mass majority of our denominational and non denominational church buildings continue to travel upon the American capitalistic way. Despite possessing the wisdom of God, in spite of constructing millions of church buildings dedicated as the House of God, and as the result having to perform to fill them to pay the bills, most churchgoers have been intentionally malnurished, taught the wisdom of men, and voluntarily enslaved while blindly pledging allegiance to the false doctrine titled the American Dream. Therefore, what kind of the profit shall be paid to this nation at the judgement throne of God when we appear with ownership of the whole world, but have lost possession of our soul. Do you still have possession of your soul? Moreover, what words shall be said about our lukewarm church organizations leadership and their followers of unclothed kings and queens. What sentence shall be given to the churchgoers whose chosen to walk around blinded by America's capitalistic light. What admonishment shall be told to the lost since churchgoers were sitting in their seats only singing about showing the lost to the way of Christ. Nevertheless, there is still hope for the leaders of our nation. There is still hope for the directors of America's church organizations. There is still hope for the every Sunday churchgoers. There is still hope for the lost of the world. There is still hope for the words of God still says ""Come!"" The voice of God is currently echoing the invitation across our nation. The hands of God is waving at us through our present circumstances and situations. God is shouting ""Come!"" Come out of her, my people,' so that you will not share in her sins, so that you will not receive any of her plagues. Come out of her and don't delay. Her sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes. Come out of her, my people,' so that you will not share in the punishment for her sins."
Daniel 3:13-30,"('Faith', 'Forgiveness')",*other," OUR GOD DAN 3 VS 13-30 Daniel 3:13-30 (NKJV) 13 Then Nebuchadnezzar, in rage and fury, gave the command to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. So they brought these men before the king. 14 Nebuchadnezzar spoke, saying to them, ""Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the gold image which I have set up? 15 Now if you are ready at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, and psaltery, in symphony with all kinds of music, and you fall down and worship the image which I have made, good! But if you do not worship, you shall be cast immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. And who is the god who will deliver you from my hands?"" 16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego answered and said to the king, ""O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. 17 If that is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king. 18 But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up."" 19 Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury, and the expression on his face changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. He spoke and commanded that they heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated. 20 And he commanded certain mighty men of valor who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, and cast them into the burning fiery furnace. 21 Then these men were bound in their coats, their trousers, their turbans, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. 22 Therefore, because the king's command was urgent, and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. 23 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. 24 Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished; and he rose in haste and spoke, saying to his counselors, ""Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?"" They answered and said to the king, ""True, O king."" 25 ""Look!"" he answered, ""I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire; and they are not hurt, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God."" 26 Then Nebuchadnezzar went near the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and spoke, saying, ""Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, servants of the Most High God, come out, and come here."" Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego came from the midst of the fire. 27 And the satraps, administrators, governors, and the king's counselors gathered together, and they saw these men on whose bodies the fire had no power; the hair of their head was not singed nor were their garments affected, and the smell of fire was not on them. 28 Nebuchadnezzar spoke, saying, ""Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, who sent His Angel and delivered His servants who trusted in Him, and they have frustrated the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they should not serve nor worship any god except their own God!"

This is the first commandment. 31 And the second, like it, is this: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'

John 8:30-32 (NKJV) 30 As He spoke these words, many believed in Him. 31 Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, ""If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed. 32 And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."" DO YOU WANT TO WALK IN FREEDOM? **PICTURE OF THE EMPTY ""WHITE HEART"" Isaiah 1:18-20 (NKJV) 18 ""Come now, and let us reason together,"" Says the LORD, ""Though your sins are like scarlet, They shall be as white as snow; Though they are red like crimson, They shall be as wool. 19 If you are willing and obedient, You shall eat the good of the land; 20 But if you refuse and rebel, You shall be devoured by the sword""; For the mouth of the LORD has spoken. Ephesians 4:25-32 (NKJV) 25 Therefore, putting away lying, ""Let each one of you speak truth with his neighbor,"" for we are members of one another. 26 ""Be angry, and do not sin"": do not let the sun go down on your wrath, 27 nor give place to the devil. 28 Let him who stole steal no longer, but rather let him labor, working with his hands what is good, that he may have something to give him who has need. 29 Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but what is good for necessary edification, that it may impart grace to the hearers. 30 And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. 31 Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice. 32 And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, just as God in Christ forgave you. **HERE WE GO, ARE YOU GUILTY OF: A. LYING- THIS HAS TAKEN A PLACE IN YOUR HEART LEAVING LESS ROOM FOR GOD. B. ARE YOU GUILTY OF SPEAKING OR LISTENING TO GOSSIP?? BOTH ARE EQUALLY BAD- DO YOU SEND IT DOWN THE CHAIN?? James 3:8-10 (NKJV) 8 But no man can tame the tongue. It is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. 9 With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the similitude of God. 10 Out of the same mouth proceed blessing and cursing.

Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; 29 and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 30 Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? 31 Therefore do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' 32 For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. 33 But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. 34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble."
Matthew 22:34-40,"('Love', 'Neighbor', 'Love Your Neighbor')",*other," OUR WHOLE HEART PT 3 (OUR NEIGHBOR AS OURSELF) MATT 22 VS 34-40 Matthew 22:34-40 (NKJV) 34 But when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. 35 Then one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him, and saying, 36 ""Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?"" 37 Jesus said to him, ""'You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.' 38 This is the first and great commandment. 39 And the second is like it: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' 40 On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets."" ** I ASKED FATHER TO SHOW ME HOW COULD I POSSIBLY LOVE MY NEIGHBOR AS MYSELF AND THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT HE SHOWED ME THAT HAS REALLY MADE ME THINK TWICE ABOUT MY NEIGHBOR(S). 1. EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US ARE CREATED IN GOD'S LIKENESS AND IMAGE: Genesis 1:26-27 (NKJV) 26 Then God said, ""Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."" 27 So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. ** YOU MAY LOOK DIFFERENT, ACT DIFFERENT- BUT NONE OF THAT CHANGES THE FACT THAT FATHER PUT JUST AS MUCH THOUGHT INTO CREATING YOU AS HE DID ME--YOU ARE A SPECIAL CREATION OF OUR FATHER. Psalm 127:3 (NKJV) 3 Behold, children are a heritage from the LORD, The fruit of the womb is a reward. Psalm 139:13 (NKJV) 13 For You formed my inward parts; You covered me in my mother's womb. Isaiah 44:24 (NKJV) 24 Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, And He who formed you from the womb: ""I am the LORD, who makes all things, Who stretches out the heavens all alone, Who spreads abroad the earth by Myself; Jeremiah 1:5 (NKJV) 5 ""Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; Before you were born I sanctified you; I ordained you a prophet to the nations."" 2. FATHER CARES(LOVES) US ALL THE SAME, THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO(WRONG) THAT CAN MAKE HIM LOVE YOU ANY LESS, THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO(RIGHT) TO MAKE HIM LOVE YOU ANY MORE- GOD LOVES YOU, NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE OF WHO YOU ARE, BUT BECAUSE THAT IS WHO HE IS: John 3:16 (NKJV) 16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. Luke 23:34 (NKJV) 34 Then Jesus said, ""Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do."" And they divided His garments and cast lots. ** JESUS WASN'T JUST LOOKING AT THE CROWD AT THAT TIME, BUT HIS GAZE TRANSCENDS ALL SPACE AND TIME, HE THOUGHT OF EVERYONE WHEN HE MADE SUCH A GREAT STATEMENT--HE NOT ONLY SAID THIS ABOUT ME, BUT ABOUT MY NEIGHBOR ALSO. 1 John 4:8 (NKJV) 8 He who does not love does not know God, for God is love. 3. HIS HAS CALLED EVERYONE TO BE A PART OF HIS FAMILY, NO EXCEPTIONS: Romans 12:3 (NKJV) 3 For I say, through the grace given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, as God has dealt to each one a measure of faith."
"Matthew 22:34-40, Matthew 28:19-20","(""God's Will"", 'Great Commission', 'Great Commandment', ""God's Calling"")",Foursquare," God's Calling for Believers After last week's Sunday night message and again this morning, I think it's important to lay out how we're to go about fulfilling the third dimension, the dimension of commission. And how we do this is to know and walk in God's will and calling. For our lives Further, what I'm going to share with you is not new. I've taught this many times and in many ways and have written about it in my book, ""From Here to There: A Journey to Spiritual Transformation."" But like the Apostle Paul I'm not tired of sharing it because it goes to the heart of our calling as Christians. Paul said, ""For me to write the same things to you is not tedious, but for you it is safe."" (Philippians 3:1 NKJV) I believe that the Lord is crying out today the same as He cried out in the day of the prophet Isaiah saying, ""Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us?"" And Isaiah stepping up to the plate said, ""Here am I! Send me"" (Isaiah 6:8 NKJV) One of the main questions most people have is ""What is God's call upon my life."" ""What has God called for me to do?"" and ""How will I know that it is God who is doing the calling?"" In other words, how do we distinguish God's voice over all the other voices that are vying for our attention? Knowing God's will is sometimes difficult. People want God to tell them specifically what to do, but God rarely gives people information that direct and specific. Further, the will of God is not mysterious, nor is it found in some formula or set of rules that we follow. There is only one indispensable thing when it comes to God's calling, and that is to fulfill His purpose according to His will. It's to be what God wants us to be so that we can reach our God given potential, and God given destiny. Our problem is that when we're unsure of God's call we start making up our own. For years a middle-aged farmer desired to be a preacher. One day while planting his crop he looked up in the clouds and they looked as if they formed the letters ""P"" and ""C."" Immediately he took this as a sign from God telling him to Preach Christ. Soon afterwards he sold his farm and started a small church. The only problem was that he was horrible at it. After one particularly bad sermon his neighbor whispered in his ear, ""Are you sure God wasn't telling you to Plant Corn."" God wants us to know His will. God's will is meant to be discovered and understood, because God wants to keep us in the center of His will. But if God wants us to know His will, why isn't it laid out plainly? Well, when it comes to His revealed will it's the specifics that are somewhat sketchy. So what is God's will and calling and how can we know it? The answer is found in those things God has definitely called all of us to, and then finding out how we fit in with the specifics. God's calling always begins and ends with God, and so the first thing is to Love God. 1. To Love God To Love God is actually at the heart of what it means to be a believer in Jesus Christ. It is the greatest of all God's commandment, and therefore it's the statement of faith for all Jews, known as the ""Shema,"" or hearing."
Luke 3:1-20,"('Truth', 'Repentance')",Baptist," ""The Truth Can Be Hard"" Luke 3:1-20 This morning you we are going to be introduced to the ministry of John the Baptist. If we were to judge John the Baptist by today's formula for a successful ministry, he pretty much did everything wrong. He did not go to where the people were he made them come to him. He did dress in the most modern style, in fact his dress was pretty weird. He did not speak pleasantly or speak to his listeners about how to ""live your best life now."" He used harsh words and told some of his listeners that they were hypocrites and ""snakes in the grass."" He confronted the nation of Israel as the first authentic prophet in over 400 years: as God's messenger, with God's message and declaring God's judgment. And Jesus declared that he was the greatest man born of woman (Matt.11:11). Approximately eighteen years have passed since Mary and Joseph found their lost twelve-year old son in the temple, ""going about his father's business"" (2:49). During the years after their return to Nazareth, Luke says that Jesus kept ""increasing in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and men"" (2:52). At the same time Luke writes that that our Lord's cousin, John ""...continued to grow and to become strong in spirit, and he lived in the deserts until the day of his public appearance to Israel"" (1:80). Luke wanted his friend Theophilus, for whom this gospel account is written, to remember how spiritually dark the world scene was before the appearance of John the Baptist, began to ""preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins,"" and John's cousin Jesus Christ, the Light of the World, was revealed as ""the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world"" (John 1:29). He therefore begins by looking at who occupied the seats of highest authority in the land at the time. In verse one we read, ""Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea (I'-tu-re'-ah) and the region of Trachonitis, (Tra-ko-ni'-tis) and Lysanias (li-sa'ni-as) tetrarch of Abilene, (2) while Annas (also Ananias) and Caiaphas were high priests,"" Luke as an able historian prepares us for John abrupt appearance on the world's stage by listing no less than seven historical figures to establish the date and context of John's ministry. It would take some doing to assemble a more wicked company of scoundrels; Tiberias, the Roman emperor wanted to be a god; Pilate, the Roman governor was despised and feared; Herod, the occupant of the Jewish throne, (although he was not Jewish) was unbalanced, dangerous and cruel; all were noted as men who wanted more than anything else to retain their power. Annas' legacy was that although deposed by the Romans he continued to control the Jewish High Priest office for three decades first through his sons (6-15 A.D.) and then his son-in-law, Caiaphas (18-36 A.D.). It was against this backdrop of political and religious darkness that ""the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness"" (v. 2)."
Mark 4:10-33,"('Parables', 'Jesus Christ', ""God's Kingdom"", 'Kingdom Of God', 'Secrets Revealed')",Evangelical Free," We are worshiping God and learning from the Gospel of Mark. Please open your Bibles to Mark 4... Our Scripture of the Week, Mark 4:11a, states that Jesus told His disciples ""The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you."" What do you think Jesus meant by that?? Jesus was simply saying that there was a mystery that is now being revealed through Him! Remember in the beginning when the first man and woman sinned against God with the encouragement by the devil in Genesis 3? God said to the devil in Genesis 3:15 ""And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel."" How was the devil to be defeated? - that was a mystery! And over and over in the Old Testament Scriptures, A Savior Messiah was promised to defeat sin once and for all; that was a mystery! Jesus Christ Himself revealed the mystery of the Kingdom of God by dying on a cross but rose from the grave! Jesus Christ then called disciples to continue the revelation of the Kingdom of God! Today, we Christians are to continue the revelation of the Kingdom of God! We have our main life application here even before reading our passage! Let us read Mark 4:10-33 and glean more details of our calling....... Last week we talked about the parable of the sower and the seed in v10-20. The secret of God's Kingdom is given through the Word of Christ. v10-20: Jesus reveals the secret of the Kingdom of God is by hearing, believing, and doing the words of Christ! v21-23: parable of a lamp What is a lamp for?? What then do you do with a lamp?? What does this have to do with the Kingdom of God?? The secret to the Kingdom of God being disclosed by God is meant to be told and heard! v24-25? The Kingdom of God continues to grow as Believers of Christ have an attitude of listening, learning, and doing because God will bless them; but people not listening to Christ, God will take away what they have. v26-29: parable of the seed growing... What is the farmer's main job in this passage?? The farmer waits and almost miraculously the seed sprouts and matures! The grain then is harvested! What does this parable mean? I struggled with this one; but after much prayer and again looking deeper into the passage, the key is noting why the parable was stated! Remember that a parable is an analogy. What is the parable of the seed growing in v26-29 an analogy of? Why was the parable stated? Let us note that Jesus stated it in the beginning of the passage: The Kingdom of God is like a seed growing! The parable again is like the reality of the Kingdom of God. And so, in reality, what makes the Kingdom of God?? People believing in Jesus Christ makes the Kingdom of God! If people believing in Jesus Christ makes the Kingdom of God, then the seed in v26-29 must be people who matures to salvation with the power of God Himself! I am open to further discussion with this if you like, but let's again note that the main topic in these parables is the Kingdom of God growing; and just because Jesus explained a seed in one parable as the Word of God, a seed in another parable can mean something else."

Introduction: "" There are several words that can describe what I want to talk with you about this morning. Some of them include: Calm, Tranquility, Quiet, Peace I. Jesus Calms the Storm - Mark 4:35-41 A. Jesus had just finished teaching lessons on sowing seed in good soil and had illustrated the Kingdom of God with a grain of mustard seed... 1. Many are the times that Holy Spirit will teach us from the Word and then it will seem that God is silent as we put into practice that which we have learned. 2. This is God's way of ""training"" us to be powerful disciples! B. The declaration of faith is found in verse 35 where Jesus told the disciples ""let us pass over unto the other side."" 1. If God speaks it we can count on it! C. V.39 - Jesus rebuked both the winds and the sea. 1. His words of rebuke were speaking into the future past, the storm, and bringing the peace that was imminent into the present. a. Jesus did not cry ""stop""! He COMMANDED the outcome with the words of His mouth... ""Peace be Still...""and they obeyed Him. 2. Lesson: There is peace somewhere! a. Faith is ""calling things that be not as though they were."" Romans 4:17 (referencing Abraham) 3. When God gives you peace it is complete. Mark 4:41 And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? II. Keys to a quiet & peace-filled life - Straight from the Word! 1 Thessalonians 4:9-12 (9) But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another. (10) And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more; (11) And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you; (12) That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing. 1 Timothy 2:1-4 (1) I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; (2) For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. (3) For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; (4) Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. 1 Peter 3:1-12 (1) Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives; (2) While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear. (3) Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; (4) But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. (5) For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:"

I have had a love for ""who done it"" mysteries from childhood. My mom. Charlie Chan WGN 2. Hardy Boys, Ellery Queen, Agatha Christie 3. Perry Mason, Murder She Wrote, Death in Paradise ... I enjoy trying to figure out who done it. 4. 2 Kings 3 has its mysteries, and I have enjoying trying to solve them. Main commentaries did not even raise the questions, let alone answer them. I dug around, though, and found the answers. We will note some of those. 5. But the main lesson of the text is understandable, even with unanswered questions. Main Idea: Human wisdom is often our default mode of operation, but we need to learn to consult God before we engage in major undertakings or decisions. I. The FLOW of Events (1-27) Daniel Arnold points out that this chapter is written in a chiasm (inverse parallelism) A. Sin of the King of ISRAEL (1-3) B. PREPARATION for battle against Moab (4-8) C.

Though he lost the battle he did not lose his life or his capital."" II. The Central Point: God's EAR Is Toward the Godly (13-14) A. Why didn't these kings ask God FIRST? 1. We, too, forget we are not operating independently. 2. We need to consult God's Word, consult God's people, consider our motives, ask why we want to do what we want to do. Ask God to show us our motives and what we need to see. 3. Elisha is discerning; the kings are shortsighted. B. God helped Jehoram because of JEHOSHAPHAT. "" Why did these three nations - Israel, Judah, and Edom ally themselves? "" Do you recognize yourself as one who can pray with lost/struggling believers, and God can bless and help them through you? Priesthood of all believers. C. Even though Jehoram was better than Ahab, his father, he was still COMPROMISED. D. The prayers of a RIGHTEOUS man avail much. "" Debate: does God hear the prayer of an unbeliever? "" Does God hear the prayer of all believers equally? "" Equal access does not mean equal power (Secretary of State. Vs. St. Dept.) E. God counts us RIGHTEOUS because of Jesus."
2 Corinthians 9:8,"('Giving', 'Cheerful Giving')",Baptist," How to Make Giving Fun A Stewardship Sermon Chuck sligh January 15, 2017 Sparked by thoughts on preaching about giving by Robert Russell at http://thecharisgroup.org/2012/07/18/how-to-preach-on-giving-2/. TEXT: 2 Corinthians 9:8 - ""But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. 7 Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. 8 And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:"" INTRODUCTION This is the second and last sermon in a two-week series on giving to God. If you were here last week, today you will get a fuller, deeper understanding of giving. If you weren't here last week, well, this is why I normally preaching TWO sermons on giving--to make sure ALL are challenged on this important topic about giving to God. Last week, I tried to lay down a theological foundation for giving, and we discussed two reasons people struggle don't tithe--they struggle with God's OWNERSHIP of all they have; and they struggle with God's LORDSHIP by being obedient to give. Today, I'm not going to be theological; I'm going to be practical or informative. My thesis is this: Giving to God can and should be fun. Now some of you just about fell on your face at that statement, but it's true. The Bible talks about fun giving. We see it in our text. - The end of verse 7 says, ""...For God loveth a cheerful giver."" The Greek word for ""cheerful"" is hilarós [??a???], from which we get our English words hilarious and hilarity. Strong's Enhanced Concordance says it means, ""cheerful, joyous, prompt to do anything."" The Concise Dictionary of New Testament Words defines it as ""...merry (""hilarious""), i.e. prompt or willing:--cheerful."" Vines Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words says hilarós, ""signifies that readiness of mind, that joyousness, which is prompt to do anything; hence, cheerful (Eng., hilarious)."" I went a little overboard on the Greek sources because I want you to see all the nuances of this word. God is saying here that He doesn't want giving to be this thing we do grudgingly and resentfully; He wants us to give cheerfully, joyously, merrily, hilariously, readily, willingly, eagerly, enthusiastically. Or to put it another way, God wants it to be fun! Doesn't that run counter to everything you've ever thought? You say, ""Chuck, you don't really expect us to really think giving is fun, do you?"" Well, it is counter-intuitive, but really, isn't the whole of the Christian life counter-intuitive? Think about it: Jesus said that he who loses his life for His sake will save it. He also said the first will be last and the last will be first. He likewise said, ""Give and it shall be given unto you."" And Paul teaches that that we give up our lives to Christ to gain our freedom. So why would it surprise us that one way to have fun in life is to learn generosity?"
"Ephesians 6:10-14, Colossians 2:8-10","('Deception', 'Spiritual Warfare', 'Armor', 'Armor Of God', 'Spiritual War')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Pearl Harbor was attacked on December 7, 1941. Just a few hours later, Clark Airfield in the Philippines was attacked and the entire air wing dedicated to defending the Philippines and American interests in Asia was destroyed. Singapore was attacked and just a few days after the Pearl Harbor attack, the HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse were sunk outside of the Singapore harbor on Dec 10. How could such a strong military power such as the USA and Great Britain be destroyed so thoroughly and so quickly? If you have ever watched the film ""Pearl Harbor"" you can get a picture of why this happened. Sailors and military personnel in Hawaii prior to the Japanese invasion were living as if there was no real enemy. They were not expecting to be attacked. The Japanese were engaged in a massive deception, trying to convince the US that Japan was seeking peace, all the while planning war. Japan was an enemy planning to destroy the USA and we didn't know it. We were at WAR and didn't know it! A similar situation exists for many Christians today. We do not realize that there is a spiritual battle in our lives. It's December 7, but we are living as if it were December 6. WARFARE terminology is frequently used to describe the SPIRITUAL BATTLE that we face as believers. ""For though we walk in the flesh, we are not waging war according to the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy strongholds."" (2 Corinthians 10:3-4, ESV) ""For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms."" (Ephesians 6:12, NIV84) ""See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ."" (Colossians 2:8, NIV84) To survive in this battle, we must answer the following questions: 1.Does Satan exist?1.Barna survey found four of ten Christians (40%) strongly agreed that Satan ""is not a living being but is a symbol of evil."" 2.Another 19% said they ""agree somewhat"" with the perspective. 3.How can we fight a spiritual battle when 60% of Christians don't think that the enemy is real? 2.Does it matter if we believe in Satan?1.Some Christians think that belief in Satan is optional. After all, if you believe in Jesus that should be enough. 2.Satan is mentioned 29 times in the Gospels, and 25 of those references are from Jesus. 3.Satan is mentioned in the Old Testament and in every New Testament book. A Biblical World View Understands the REALITY of SATAN. 1.He is the Ruler (Prince) of the world. ""Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out."" (John 12:31, NIV84). HOW is Satan the Ruler of this world? Through society, ideas, evil people. However, there are LIMITS to Satan's rule:?Limited TIME ?Limited SCOPE (God always has a remnant) ?Limited POWER (""Greater is He that is in you..."" 1 John 4:4)"
"Matthew 22:41-46, 2 Samuel 7:8-16","('Son Of God', 'Son Of David', 'Book Of Psalms', 'Jesus And Pharisees')",Lutheran," ""What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?"" With these two questions, Jesus turns the tables on the Pharisees once again. They, along with the Sadducees and Herodians had put Jesus to the test several times in a row. They asked Him unimaginable, theoretical, philosophical, theological questions. Questions argued by respected rabbis for ages. Questions they were convinced only had two answers--and no matter which way Jesus answered, they, no doubt, planned to oppose him, and accuse him of blasphemy before the plethora of Passover pilgrims gathered around. The problem is, Jesus has this funny way of always finding an alternative answer. A holier, more God-pleasing answer. An answer they never could have imagined. And so, with every unimaginable, theoretical, philosophical, theological question posed to Him, Jesus foiled their plans. Again and again. And, now, Jesus asks the question--two questions, really. One: ""What do you think about the Christ?"" And two: ""Whose son is he?"" And how they answer the second question--the question Jesus seems to be driving at most--how they answer the second question will in turn answer the first question, what they think about the Christ. The Pharisees probably laughed in Jesus' face at the question. They just gave him difficult question upon difficult question...and all He asks is ""whose son is the Christ?!"" Child's play! After all, everyone knows that. So they quickly answer, without even thinking: ""The son of David."" Easy! Now, it's not necessarily that they were wrong; it's not a bad answer...just inadequate, incomplete. You see, their answer betrays the fact that they believe the Christ would purely and strictly be an earthly ruler. What they believe about the Christ was entirely based on what their finite minds could comprehend. When they say ""Son of David"" they only have in mind a human lineage. They were well aware of God's promise to King David in 2 Samuel 7--the promise to one day ""raise up [David's] offspring...and [to] establish the throne of his kingdom forever."" They were well aware of the prophets Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Haggai and Zechariah all pointing to David's righteous branch who would come and inaugurate a new Israel, establishing an endless dynasty with descendant after descendant after descendant ascending to the throne. They were even aware of the supposed ""Psalms of Solomon,"" a set of 18 songs attributed to the former wise king, though written in 50 BC--about eight or nine hundred years after Solomon's death. Nevertheless, these psalms were popular; especially the 17th Psalm of Solomon, which includes a prayer to God for the coming of the son of David. ""Behold, O Lord, and raise up unto them their king, the son of David, At the time in the which Thou seest, O God, that he may reign over Israel Thy servant, And gird him with strength, that he may shatter unrighteous rulers, And that he may purge Jerusalem from nations that trample (her) down to destruction."" It goes on to point to the Son of David, the Christ, casting out sinners, destroying, judging them and leading the righteous. So, when the Pharisees are asked, ""Whose son is the Christ?"" they, without hesitation, point to David."
Galatians 3:23-29,"('Fellowship', 'New Year', 'Body Of Christ', 'Resolutions')",Lutheran," It's that time again--time to set lofty goals for yourself. Time to aim high for 2017. Time to dream that you might be one of only 8% of Americans who actually fulfill a new year's resolution! Year after year, we do this to ourselves...no matter how many times we fall into the 92% failure category. This year, like every year, people are set on making their resolutions into realities. New Year's resolutions are nothing new, though--humans have been failing at self-imposed expectations for centuries upon centuries. The Babylonians, for instance, would make promises to their gods at the beginning of each new year--promises to return borrowed items or tools, or to pay their debts. The Romans, too, started the year off by making vows to their god Janus--hence the name January. In the middle ages, at the end of the Christmas season, knights would reaffirm their commitment to chivalry through a rite known as the ""peacock vow."" In the 1700s, various Protestant denominations began ""watchnight services"" late at night on December 31st and into the wee hours of January 1st; at this time, they would pray for resolutions they had made. And in the United States, since the Great Depression the percentage of adults making New Year's resolutions has gone from 25% to about 50%. There's just something about the human experience that stirs up a determination within us to change, to improve, to start something new. If you do a Google Search on ""Top Ten New Year's Resolutions,"" most often you find body-related goals. On some of these top ten lists, you'll see multiple body-related resolutions. Most often on these lists: lose weight, exercise more, eat healthier. It's no wonder at this time of year, you see more commercials for Weight Watchers. Parking lots at the gyms and fitness centers you drive past are full of cars (for at least a couple of months). Friends on Facebook and Twitter are posting more health-conscious updates. And, did you know that the day after Christmas, the Fitbit App was the most-downloaded free app? (http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/12/26/app-store-trends-suggest-top-christmas-gifts-vr-drones-cameras-amazon-echo) We want change. We want to better ourselves. So what better place to start than the thing people see most? It's obvious. The first place to start is the body. I even found--while doing my Google searching--I even found an article from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons entitled, ""Plastic Surgery and New Year's Resolutions."" (https://www.plasticsurgery.org/news/blog/plastic-surgery-and-new-years-resolutions) The author, a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon (surprise, surprise), noted some of the same things I've mentioned. That, often, on the top of people's lists of resolutions are body-related goals. The author indicates more people consider plastic surgery at the beginning of the year as a path toward achieving these body-related resolutions, and to improve one's self-esteem. And, interestingly, he also suggests that--and this is a direct quote: ""the popularity of social media and the rise of the 'selfie' have made individuals more conscious about how they look. No longer is plastic surgery something that one considers as they age. It is not uncommon for people in their 20s to have plastic surgery to improve their image, which can subsequently influence their professional lives through social media."""
1 John 3:16-17,"('Compassion', 'Helping Others', 'Helping Poor', 'Listening To Others')",Salvation Army," 2017 A Year to Increase Compassion Kelly Durant 1-7-17 1 John 3:16 16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 1 John 3:17 But whoso hath this world's good, and sees his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him? 2. According to a Miami Herald article that I found last week, people here don't care for each other in our neighborhood. (http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article123076079.html) Observe that we see that Miami, and Hialeah rank almost at the very bottom of 100 cities in the U.S.A. in showing compassion on people with needs. In other words, we live in one of the coldest hearted cities in America! I am not surprised by this discovery, you and I can feel it day to day from our neighbors. There are many nice people here but it is obvious many people have never been taught nor exposed to what showing compassion really means. Many of you may not even perceive this sad phenomenon though. This level of indifference and rudeness is just normal for you in your day to day actions. What we are focusing in on here is nothing new as Jesus told us that ""the love of many will wax cold"". Sadly, our expectancy in this decaying world is that year after it will be getting worse. But look at with this focus, the people of the world are getting worse but it should not be that way with us who know to live differently with God's love! We are renewed from day to day with Jesus and the Holy Spirit and we should be getting warmer and more loving, caring, and compassionate from day to day. Today let's examine ourselves and our immediate surroundings as they relate to how we are serving one another. You and I live here and we must do an assessment, are we a part of the problem, or a part of the solution? Now that a year has gone by, have you assessed all that has happened to you? People that knew you a year ago, what do they think of you now? What does God think of you? Only you know the secrets He will hold you accountable for. What about all that has happened in our community and what could you or I have done to make it better? 3. The question of the day is: How much compassion do you have really have for others? What you think about yourself and what God and others perceive could be very different. Proverbs 21:2 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the Lord pondereth the hearts. There are many verses in the Bible that command us to show compassion but few people make big progress towards this. In the verses of today in 1 John 3 it basically helps you to see that a person that says they love God and do not do anything to help those in need is basically lying. Words must be accompanied by deeds to be true. I have talked to hundreds of people that have had bad experiences with pretend be Christians. These people explained that they needed something emotionally, spiritually, or physically and that the church's pastor or leaders let them down. Have you ever been let down? Have you ever let someone down? Jesus never let anyone down, he fed 5,000 that later He said some were following Him just for the food; Jesus healed the sick that often did not thank Him like only 1 leper out of 10, but He preached and gave love as God's main message even though in the end He was not loved and appreciated by all."
"James 1:27, Deuteronomy 24:17-22","('Religious', 'Widows And Orphans')",Christian/Church Of Christ," ARE YOU RELIGIOUS? (part two) Recap: James 1:26, ""If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless."" We looked at chapter three and realized why James highlighted the tongue-because it's the hardest to tame. Basically if we can tame the tongue, the rest of us will be in check. I deceive myself because James said fresh water and salt water cannot come from the same spring; nor does a grapevine produce figs. Therefore, I shouldn't think that I have a pure heart when what's coming out of my mouth is impure. I can't think that I'm truly religious when I'm not guarded in my speech. I don't show myself to be truly religious when I speak one way inside of church but the opposite way outside of it. This behavior renders my religion as worthless because I'm being hypocritical; I'm discounting the good I say when I turn and speak vulgarities, lies and gossip. I'm showing others that my religion is worthless to me. And if I'm focused on being quick to listen and slow to speak, along with getting rid of the old speech and replacing with spiritual speech I'll be able to keep a tight rein on my tongue. James 1:27a, ""Religion that God our Father accept as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress."" 1) To look after orphans and widows. James singles out two groups of people who society would deem unworthy. Not worth the time; not worth the effort. Why? Because if I help them they probably won't be able to repay me. So if I go out of my way to minister to the poor, the needy, the homeless, the widow, the orphan, I am helping someone who cannot pay me back. I must be willing to help this person knowing I will not get repaid. If I can do that then I know my motive is to please God and not myself. Thus I entertain true religion in the eyes of God. In the beginning of the sermon last week I mentioned how James broke through the idea of what something is and explained what it really is. He does it in chapter one regarding religion and he does it in chapter two regarding the subject of faith. In speaking of faith James provides a scenario showing that mere words aren't enough; it needs to be followed up with action if it's authentic. James 2:14-17, ""What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him? Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to him, ""Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed,"" but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead."" As faith without action is dead, likewise religion without action is dead. In 1:27 James is showing that merely saying the right things is not enough to render someone truly religious; there needs to be action. James mentions taking care of orphans and widows. In chapter two he highlights taking care of a fellow believer who is without the basic necessities of clothes and food. He said if we offer kind words and send him on his way how have we really helped? Not that prayer doesn't help but what the person needs in the moment is provision that would satisfy his material needs."
Genesis 41:9-14,"('Purpose', 'Perspective', 'Trials')",Assembly Of God," LORD MAKE ME AN ANSWER Gen. 41:9-14 INTRODUCTION A. HUMOR: TUNNEL VISION 1. How many basketball fans do we have here this morning? Do any of you know who was the best free throw shooter in the world in 1994? Did he play for the NBA? NO! 2. According to Sports Illustrated, the guy's name is Tom Amberry and he set the record back in 1993. Tom was a foot doctor. 3. In 1993 this foot doctor set the world record by making 2,750 free throws in a row over 12 hours. Can you imagine that 2,750 free throws in a row. Guess how old he was? 71! 4. He was in a gym in California with all kinds of things going on around him. A volleyball team running around the gym while he was doing this. 5. Sports Illustrated asks, ""How did Tom Amberry set the world free throw record? Focus, Focus, Focus!"" Tom says that I just stay in my routine of three bounces and focus. 6. Tom didn't miss number 2751 by the way; they turned out the lights and closed the gym on him. Tom had tunnel vision, singular focus. [Horace Wimpey. Verified Googled ""most consecutive free throw shots""] 7. He's the foot doctor I'd want operating on me! [Ted St Martin surpassed him in 1996. But Amberry was hired by the Chicago Bulls to train their shooters!] B. SIX KEY POINTS ABOUT VISION 1. Vision of God will always bring about divine transformation. Isaiah was transformed by his vision of God! Isa. 6:1. So was Saul of Tarsus! 2. Correct Vision of God will give you a correct picture of yourself. When the white-hot light of God shines in your soul, you'll know the truth about yourself! 3. A vision will make you know where to stand and what to stand for. The sons of Issachar ""knew the times and what Israel ought to do"" and they promoted David for king. 1Chron. 12:32. 4. Vision is the major difference between Success and Mediocrity. Without a vision, we'll either do nothing spiritually, or the world will pull us into its vortex. We must have a vision! 5. To every God-given Vision there is a divine provision. Abram, Joseph, Moses, David, etc. 6. Vision without action is daydream. Action without vision is Nightmare. You need to run with your vision. Habakkuk 2:2-3 C. THESIS 1. God doesn't just have a vision for some of us, but a vision for ALL of us! You say, ""So what vision does God have for me personally?"" 2. I'm glad that you asked! The answer is, the Lord wants you to begin seeing yourself and your life differently, as He sees you! 3. The title of this message is ""Lord, Make Me An Answer."" I. PRACTICAL EXAMPLES OF THIS IDEA A. IN A MARRIAGE 1. Some of you may have a marriage that is strained. Marriages often require God's insight to be successful. 2. Now, when you get married, you marry someone with baggage. In every marriage you have to deal with the other person's baggage; you only get to choose what kind of baggage you're going to have to deal with. 3. Some ladies are married to a man with a strong relationship with his mother. For him, his mother was an answer. He's worried about caring for his mother. 4. If you (his wife) get opposed to his mother, he'll see you as a problem. It will drive you two apart."
Psalms 73:1-28,"('Refuge', 'Lament')",Anglican," A Psalm of Lament audio (5MB) Psalm 73 Today we start a short series on the Psalms - culminating in our evening worship service with Sons of Korah on May 26th. Over the next 3 weeks we'll be looking at 4 different types of psalm - today a psalm of lament, next week a psalm of yearning, then a psalm of hope and on that Sunday evening a psalm of praise. Before we begin it's important to understand that psalms are first and foremost poetry. Poetry is a great medium for expressing feelings. The words that are used are not always exact, nor are they meant to be heard literally. Rather they're meant to evoke a response of the heart. They often appeal to the emotions rather than the intellect. That makes them particularly helpful for people who are struggling with life, who perhaps don't have the energy to think things through rationally or who are too unsettled to think calmly. These people can join with the psalmist in pouring their heart out to the Lord. Psalms are also good when you're so full of joy that you can't put it into words. That's when the psalmist calls on the mountains and trees to sing their praises along with his own. Well, today we're looking at Psalm 73, a lament. The psalm begins with a familiar refrain: ""God is good to those who love him."" That's one of the foundations of our understanding of God, isn't it? God is good. God loves us. God has chosen us. He'll never forsake us. He'll look after us. What's more he'll bless those who remain faithful to him with every good gift. And so the psalmist believes. But wait a minute - that's not how it looks in the real world. As he looks around him he realises that the reality of his world is at odds with what he's been taught, with what he believes. In fact the discord is so great that it almost trips him up. He looks around and who is it that he sees apparently receiving the blessing of God? It isn't the godly. It's the arrogant, the wicked. He's probably been to the hairdresser or the dentist and picked up a back copy of New Idea or Who Weekly and what does he see: pictures of the beautiful people, sunning themselves in the Bahamas or the Riviera, with their sleek, sun-tanned bodies, glowing with health, driving the latest sports car. And with the pictures are the gossip columnists' stories of people leaving one partner to join up with another, fighting among themselves, driving under the influence, overindulging in various ways; but mostly just rich people taking self-care to the point of indulgence. And then he realises that these people aren't just well-off by chance or good luck. No, they're skilful at self-interest. What's more, they have no shame about it. In fact they boast about it. What's more their prosperity, he sees, is based on violence (6) & oppression (8). So what does he think to himself? ""How come I don't have that sort of life?"" He envies their success. He wants what they've got. Does that thought ever cross your mind when you see the A-list people strutting down the red carpet? Appearing in the sponsors marquees at the races or the Grand Prix? Why doesn't God bless me like that?"
Habakkuk 1:1-17,"('Injustice', 'Righteous By Faith')",Anglican," The cry for justice is a common occurrence in our world isn't it? Injustice takes place at all sorts of levels and we wonder, why does God allow it? It's like what we saw in Psalm 73 a few weeks ago. Why do the wicked prosper? Why do the powerful get away with taking advantage of the weak and helpless? Why doesn't God do something about it if he's the good and powerful God that we think he is? Those are the sorts of questions that Habakkuk struggles with as he looks at the nation of Israel. And as we'll see in a moment there's an even more difficult question that needs answering. That's the question that arises when we see evildoers being punished at the hands of those who are just as evil if not more so. We occasionally see on the news stories of bikie gang members being shot by members of rival gangs and you think that's justice - yet it's justice carried out by someone whose as wicked as the one receiving the punishment. It's sometime around the end of the 7th century BC. The nation has gone through a period of revival under Josiah but now he's dead and the rich and powerful are back to their old tricks. Habakkuk describes himself as a prophet, that is someone who brings a message from God to the nation, yet his prophecy turns out to be a dialogue between him and God. As you read through it you may notice certain parallels between this and the book of Job. Habakkuk sees injustice and he turns to God and complains bitterly. God replies. Then Habakkuk complains further. And what is it he's complaining about? Violence! And God's apparent disinterest. He says ""2O Lord, how long shall I cry for help, and you will not listen? Or cry to you ""Violence!"" and you will not save?"" Notice he isn't asking for God to save. Clearly he's been doing that for some time. No, he's asking God what's going on? What's the hold-up? Surely this is something that God wants - to see justice in the land. So why doesn't he do something about it? And then we see something else about this complaint. He says: ""3Why do you make me see wrongdoing and look at trouble? Destruction and violence are before me; strife and contention arise."" The violence here isn't being done to him; he's just an onlooker seeing its effect on other people. But it's such that it causes him distress. What is this violence that he's so concerned about? Well, the other prophets may give us an idea. They speak about the rich and powerful taking advantage of their power to steal land, to enslave poor people, to increase their wealth through unfair trade arrangements or through bribery and corruption. And here we see a similar thing. Those two words, strife and contention are both legal words. It implies that these people are using the law to wrong those who either don't understand it or simply don't have the wherewithal to fight their case. Sounds familiar doesn't it? What happens when the legal aid system has its budget cut so poor people can't afford to go to court any more or can't afford to be defended by a barrister?"
2 Timothy 3:14-4:5,"('Bible', 'Bible Reading', 'Christian Maturity')",Anglican," I wonder how many of you are old enough to remember a TV show called the Greatest American Hero. It was about an ordinary guy who encounters aliens who've decided that earth is in such a bad way it needs saving. So they send him a belt that gives him super powers. They also give him a set of instructions for using the belt but somehow he manages to lose them; and so he blunders from one adventure to another, never really working out how to control these new super powers. Well I think that's something of a parable of many Christians who've received the gift of the Holy Spirit, have been brought into the people of God, but they don't really know how to live from then on, because they've forgotten to read the instruction manual. It's not that they've lost the instructions but they've never read the details. In some cases they've never had their own copy of the instructions or the one they have isn't readable. I visited an older parishioner a few years ago and was discussing some theological question they had but when I asked if they had a Bible we could look at, the only one in the house was the King James Version. Now I know the language is beautiful, or so they say, but when you're trying to understand what something means it's very hard to do when the language is so foreign to you, when words have changed so much in 400 years. But at least they had a Bible and read it regularly. Well, let me ask you, Does it matter if I read my Bible regularly? Would you be any worse off if you only read the Bible here on a Sunday? It's almost as if Paul knew we'd ask that sort of question when he wrote to Timothy. He certainly seemed to have a good idea what life would be like in the 21st century. Listen to what we just read in 2 Tim 4:3-4: ""3For the time is coming when people will not put up with sound doctrine, but having itching ears, they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own desires, 4and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander away to myths."" That's not a bad description of the times we live in, is it: people not wanting to hear the truth of the gospel but instead turning to myths and forms of spirituality that seem more palatable and that put less demand on their moral life? People wanting to set their own standards of behaviour rather than following those that God has prescribed. So they turn to new age gurus or even Christian ministers who've shaped their theology to meet current cultural norms. I discovered on Friday that there's a new term for this- it's called Progressive Christianity. Apparently if you throw out all the central beliefs of Christianity you've progressed! But the problem is, truth matters. As much as people would suggest that all truth is relative there are some things that don't change just because we don't like them. One of the reasons we need to know our Bibles well is so that we'll understand the world from the point of view of the one who created it, so we can follow the maker's instructions. If we want to follow the truth then we need to know the one who is the Truth. And the way we get to know him is to read what he's revealed to us."

Romans 12:1-13,"(""God's Love"", 'Christian Community')",Anglican," What better occasion to be talking about community than at a confirmation and baptism service. The teenagers have just spent 4 weeks following a study called the People of God where they've thought about why God calls us to be members of his Church. You could ask them later what they found out. But it's also a good time to be thinking about the third element of our Mission statement because confirmation services are the occasions when young people say publicly that they've decided to join in the mission of their church. But let me warn you guys, this third mission directive is not the easiest thing to achieve. How do you build community when we're all so different: different ages; different cultural backgrounds; different languages; different educational levels; different income levels; even different footy teams; not to mention people who don't like footy! And of course we've just made it worse by expanding our ministry to include a third cultural group! It's a big task we've set ourselves, isn't it? So how are we going to achieve it? When Paul wrote to the Ephesian church, a church with similar issues concerning different cultures, he saw that his only hope was to get down on his knees and pray for God's help. Listen to what he prayed (Eph 3:14-17): ""14For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, 15from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name. 16I pray that, according to the riches of his glory, he may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through his Spirit, 17and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, as you are being rooted and grounded in love."" Do you see that within his prayer is the key to our motivation for building community, as well as the means for overcoming the obstacles that we might encounter? Our Motivation He says ""We are all part of the one family of God."" We may come from vastly different earthly backgrounds but we're first of all made in the image of God and now God has brought us into the one heavenly family. Even if some churches don't seem particularly heavenly that is our status before God. He's adopted us as his sons and daughters. We have that in common. But still, we're all fallen human beings. So we need more than that if we're to overcome the obstacles that stand in the way of loving community. The Means What Paul prays for is that they'll be strengthened with power through his Spirit. He prays that Christ dwelling in their hearts might make all the difference. You see, this is the change factor: with the power of the Holy Spirit, with Christ dwelling in our hearts, we'll be rooted & grounded in love. It's this love of God that'll make all the difference if we let it flow through us. So how are we going to help that to happen? Again, Paul gives us the answer, this time in Romans 12, our reading for today. He lays out a process for change and then gives us a picture of what our community should be like - and how to achieve it. The Process The first step is the hardest: He says ""Present your bodies as a living sacrifice."" Do you understand what that means? It's not the sort of sacrifice that people make when they give up chocolate for Lent or go on a 40 hour famine for World Vision. No, in Paul's world a sacrifice means giving up your life; offering everything you have to your god. For us to present our bodies as a living sacrifice means giving up our rights, sacrificing our pleasures, our personal interests, for the sake of service to God."
1 Timothy 1:1-11,"('False Teaching',)",Anglican," It's interesting that the two places where Paul spent the most time in his missionary travels, Corinth and Ephesus, appear from his letters to have the most problems. He certainly spends a lot of his time writing to correct the errors that were being introduced by certain people. But then we shouldn't be surprised about that. Wherever God's ministers are doing good work we can expect Satan to be working hard to oppose them. In fact, on his final visit to them, Paul warned the Ephesian elders to look out for opposition. Let me read you what he said as he addressed the Ephesian elders: ""29I know that after I have gone, savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. 30 Some even from your own group will come distorting the truth in order to entice the disciples to follow them. 31 Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to warn everyone with tears."" Acts 20:29-31 (NRSV) Now it seems that those wolves have indeed come into the Church. And so Paul writes to them addressing 5 main topics: what Christians believe; how we should conduct worship; who should be leaders in the church; how we should handle our social responsibilities; and what our attitude should be to material possessions. Now much of what he says is addressed to the particular context of Ephesus, with its strong affiliation to Artemis, or Diana - the Goddess of the Hunt and of Fertility. The temple of Artemis in Ephesus was one of the 7 wonders of the ancient world and the population was very proud of their goddess. But there's also the general context of a culture where authority and influence came with years and to be considered wise you needed to be old. One of the things we'll discover as we go through this letter is that the Church is central to Paul's thinking. Can you see why that is? It's because the Church is the visible messenger of the gospel. So the way Christians live as a Church is emphasised because what others see when they look at us will either promote or undermine the gospel. Well, let's look at chapter 1. He begins in his usual style by announcing himself, describing the recipient of the letter and reminding the readers of the source of all they have. We often jump over these introductory sentences, but here the way he introduces his letter is quite significant. Notice how carefully he describes himself. Not just as an apostle but as an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Saviour and of Christ Jesus our hope. He wants to emphasise his authority as an Apostle, not just of the Church; he's not just a missionary like we might send out today; no, he's an apostle of Jesus Christ, chosen, appointed and authorised directly by Christ our hope and by God our Saviour. The term ""by the command of"" is the sort of formula that would have been used in an official letter of authorisation. We use the same term today in ""Royal Command Performance"". He speaks as one authorised by God himself. Similarly he addresses Timothy as ""my true child in the faith."" The term translated there as loyal was used for legitimate children. It's as though Paul wants to pass on to Timothy some of his own authority by referring to him as a genuine child of Paul. Paul, of course, was responsible for his conversion so he saw him as his spiritual son, but he no doubt also sees him as a true child because he holds faithfully to Paul's teaching."
1 Timothy 1:12-2:7,"('False Teaching', 'Only One Way To God')",Anglican," Imagine for a minute that you're Timothy. If you can, think back to what it was like to be 30! Now, imagine you're slightly reserved, perhaps a little timid. You've travelled around with Paul, but now he's left you in charge of the church at Ephesus. At long last, you receive a letter from Paul. Except, instead of saying he'll be there next week, it looks like he's going to be delayed for some time. He's writing to remind you of what you've been left there to do. It's your job to get the church in Ephesus in order, to oversee the household of God. What's more, the very first thing he wants you to do is confront some of the elders and leaders of the church who've deviated from the truth, who're distorting the gospel. In verse 18, we see it wasn't an easy task. Paul uses the language of a fight, of conflict and war, to describe the struggle that Timothy is engaged in. So how are you feeling? Are you up to the task? How are you going to take on these false teachers? What's going to keep you going? The truth of course is that not many of us will find ourselves in exactly the same situation as Timothy. But, we will all encounter false teaching. At some stage or another, we'll all come across those who want to distort the message of the gospel. We'll all have to think about how we're going to respond. The good news is that Paul doesn't leave us dangling. He encourages Timothy, and us, left right and centre. Paul says the answer is to focus on the gospel, which is trustworthy and true. Throughout this passage, that language abounds. Paul reminds us again and again, that his message is true and trustworthy, that the gospel is true, that his ministry and message is true and faithful. He says we must be true to the gospel, we must cling to it. We must faithfully live it out in our lives, both individually and as a church. At the end of verse 11, Paul had reminds Timothy to focus on the sound teaching 11that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me. It's possible that the false teachers had been calling Paul's leadership into question. But the truth is that God entrusted Paul with the gospel. As we saw last week from verse 1, Paul was appointed an apostle by the command of Jesus Christ. What's more, God judged him to be faithful, to be trustworthy in this service. But Paul acknowledges this is only the case because God first strengthened him. He's incredibly thankful, he's grateful, that God has not just called him, but also equipped and strengthened him to carry the gospel. Paul wants us to know that he wasn't entrusted with the gospel based on his own merits. His credentials were hardly suitable for this task. In fact, if you'd received Paul's C.V., he's the last person you'd be recommending for the job. With incredible honesty he tells us that he was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor of the church, a violent man. This description matches up with what we see in the early chapters of Acts. Paul/Saul, was there when Stephen was martyred. He looked on; he gave his approval, as the crowds stoned Stephen. Then in Acts 9 we read that:"
"1 Timothy 2:1-15, 1 Timothy 2:8-15","('Worship', 'Women In Church')",Anglican," In 2:3&4 Paul says: ""This is right and is acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, 4 who desires everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth."" He reminds us that there is only one God and only one mediator between God and humanity, Jesus Christ. So he first asks us to pray for those who don't know Jesus, but then he goes on to tell us how we should conduct ourselves when we come together to worship. Some of what he says is for good theological reasons, but much has to do with presenting a face to the world that promotes the Gospel rather than undermining it. He speaks separately to men and women. The issues are different for men and women. And the instructions he gives speak to both our public presentation and our inner being. Men He speaks first to the men in the congregation. He says he desires that in every place men should pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or argument. So his first instruction is that men should pray. That sounds simple enough doesn't it? It certainly fits the culture of the day. The men were the ones who led in worship. But notice how they're to do it. The outward presentation is with hands upraised. That was the culturally relevant way to pray. You stood to pray and you raised your hands to God in heaven. But there's more to it than that. Their inward life needs to be in accord with their outward presentation. So they're to lift up holy hands in prayer. What are holy hands? Well, they're hands that haven't done anything to make them unclean. The psalm for today asks the question: ""Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord: or who shall stand in his holy place? And the answer it gives? ""Those who have clean hands and a pure heart: who have not set their soul upon idols, nor sworn their oath to a lie."" Holy hands here stand for a pure heart. There's no point lifting our hands in prayer to God if they're defiled by sin. Notice that the sin he's thinking of doesn't just include what you've done with your hands, the physical expressions of sin. It also includes what you do in your heart and mind. Anger and quarreling are out if you want to bring your prayers before God. How can you pray to God if you have resentment or bitterness in your heart against another person or worse still against God himself? Do you remember Jesus saying that when you bring your offering to God, if you remember you have something against another person to leave your offering at the altar and go and first be reconciled with that person? So holiness, love and peace are essential prerequisites for prayer. But what about holding up your hands? What do we do with that instruction? Do all the men who pray in church need to [become charismatics and] raise their hands whenever they pray? Should we stop this habit that some have of kneeling to pray rather than standing with their hands raised? No, there are other parts of Scripture where different postures for praying are mentioned - sitting, kneeling, bowing, even lying face down before the Lord. Clearly this is a culturally conditioned instruction that no longer holds any force for us. For Paul's time it may have been important, particularly in a Church where the Jewish heritage was still strong. As long as our posture is appropriate to our culture and expresses the right attitude to what we're doing, it doesn't really matter whether we're sitting or standing or kneeling - or waving flags for that matter."
1 Samuel 17:20-51,"('Giants', 'Overcomer', 'Facing Giants')",*other," OVERCOMING THE GIANTS 1SAM 17 VS 20-51 1 Samuel 17:20-51 (NKJV) 20 So David rose early in the morning, left the sheep with a keeper, and took the things and went as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the camp as the army was going out to the fight and shouting for the battle. 21 For Israel and the Philistines had drawn up in battle array, army against army. 22 And David left his supplies in the hand of the supply keeper, ran to the army, and came and greeted his brothers. 23 Then as he talked with them, there was the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, coming up from the armies of the Philistines; and he spoke according to the same words. So David heard them. 24 And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were dreadfully afraid. 25 So the men of Israel said, ""Have you seen this man who has come up? Surely he has come up to defy Israel; and it shall be that the man who kills him the king will enrich with great riches, will give him his daughter, and give his father's house exemption from taxes in Israel."" 26 Then David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, ""What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?"" 27 And the people answered him in this manner, saying, ""So shall it be done for the man who kills him."" 28 Now Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger was aroused against David, and he said, ""Why did you come down here? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and the insolence of your heart, for you have come down to see the battle."" 29 And David said, ""What have I done now? Is there not a cause?"" 30 Then he turned from him toward another and said the same thing; and these people answered him as the first ones did. 31 Now when the words which David spoke were heard, they reported them to Saul; and he sent for him. 32 Then David said to Saul, ""Let no man's heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine."" 33 And Saul said to David, ""You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are a youth, and he a man of war from his youth."" 34 But David said to Saul, ""Your servant used to keep his father's sheep, and when a lion or a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock, 35 I went out after it and struck it, and delivered the lamb from its mouth; and when it arose against me, I caught it by its beard, and struck and killed it. 36 Your servant has killed both lion and bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God."" 37 Moreover David said, ""The LORD, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine."" And Saul said to David, ""Go, and the LORD be with you!"" 38 So Saul clothed David with his armor, and he put a bronze helmet on his head; he also clothed him with a coat of mail."

Loose it and bring it here. 31 And if anyone asks you, 'Why are you loosing it?' thus you shall say to him, 'Because the Lord has need of it.' "" 32 So those who were sent went their way and found it just as He had said to them. 33 But as they were loosing the colt, the owners of it said to them, ""Why are you loosing the colt?"" 34 And they said, ""The Lord has need of him."" 35 Then they brought him to Jesus. And they threw their own clothes on the colt, and they set Jesus on him. 36 And as He went, many spread their clothes on the road. 37 Then, as He was now drawing near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen, 38 saying: ""'Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the LORD!' Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!"" 39 And some of the Pharisees called to Him from the crowd, ""Teacher, rebuke Your disciples."" 40 But He answered and said to them, ""I tell you that if these should keep silent, the stones would immediately cry out."" 1. THE PREPERATION- FOR THE KING TO BE PRESENTED TO ISRAEL AS KING, THERE WAS PREPERATION THAT WENT FORTH: A. THE DONKEY WAS SELECTED- SOMEONE SOMEWHERE HAD MET JESUS AND HAD OFFERED HIMSELF OR HIS THINGS TO JESUS IF HE HAD NEED OF THEM- THE DONKEY WAS SELECTED AS A SYMBOL THAT THE KING IS COMING IN PEACE. Matthew 21:4-5 (NKJV) 4 All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: 5 ""Tell the daughter of Zion, 'Behold, your King is coming to you, Lowly, and sitting on a donkey, A colt, the foal of a donkey.'

Matthew 21:10-11 (NKJV) 10 And when He had come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, ""Who is this?"" 11 So the multitudes said, ""This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee."" *DO WE PROMOTE JESUS?? *HOW DO WE PROMOTE HIM?

HOW COULD THEY NOT PRAISE HIM!!! Matthew 21:9 (NKJV) 9 Then the multitudes who went before and those who followed cried out, saying: ""Hosanna to the Son of David!

Revelation 8:2-6,"('Revelation Trumpets', 'Trumpet Judgments', 'Seven Angels', 'Golden Censer', 'Fire From The Alter')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 2/2/2016 Title: Seven Angels Prepare to Sound Their Trumpets (Revelation 8:2-6) Revelation 8:2-6 (KJV) 2 And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets. 3 And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. 4 And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand. 5 And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake. 6 And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. Introduction In John's vision, God is about to deal with the sin that is in the world. At the opening of the seventh seal, the response is silence (8:1). And a new vision begins, and we have in these five verses, the beginning of the wrath of God. The judgment of Jesus is going to be carried out. This is the great moment of justice for which suffering believers have been praying. The idea presented here is that all of the prayers for justice are given to God so that God can answer them all. He is going to begin the process of retribution for the persecution of the church. The seven angels in verse two are specific angels. They are those who stand before God. And in this case, they are the ones with the responsibility of carrying out justice on the earth. The trumpets symbolize the instruments of that judgment (8:2). The trumpet judgments, like the seal judgments, are only partial. God's final and complete judgment had not yet come. The difference between the seventh seal and the first six is who is implementing the judgment. During chapters six and seven, humankind and nature are having their way. During this vision of the trumpets, it is the angels who have been given the role of executing the judgment of God on earth. Did anyone notice that there is yet another difference between the seventh seal and the first six? It is that no specific judgment is mentioned when the seventh seal is broken? The narrative moves directly to the seven trumpet judgments. From this we infer that the seventh seal consists of the seven trumpets. There are Christians who will tell you that the Book of Revelation terrifies them. But it should not terrify you. Actually, it ought to be a comfort to you. I thank God that He is going to judge this world that is running wild today. The way that mankind has blundered and gotten this world into a mess makes it look like it is filled with madman. I thank God He is going to judge it, and He is going to judge it rightly. It is very comforting to recognize that. Maybe you don't like the fact that the gentle Jesus is going to judge. We have already seen that the wrath of the Lamb will be terrifying to those on earth. My friend, when you talk about the gentle Jesus, you had better get acquainted with Him. He died for you, He loves you, and He wants to save you, but if you will not have Him, I'd tell you, there is waiting ahead of you a terrifying judgment. Someone will say to me, ""You are trying to frightened people."" I would like to scare you into heaven if I could, but I know you are too sophisticated and too cynical for that. But, my friend, judgment is coming on this earth. I say, Hallelujah! I am glad that it is coming and that God is not going to let the world go on like it is now. It has gone on long enough."
Philippians 3:17-21,"('Paul', 'Disciples', 'Peter', 'Andrew', 'Hero')",*other," PETER, PAUL, AND ANDREW PH 3:17-21 17 Brethren, join in following my example, and note those who so walk, as you have us for a pattern. 18 For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: 19 whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame--who set their mind on earthly things. 20 For our citizenship is in heaven, from which we also eagerly wait for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, 21 who will transform our lowly body that it may be conformed to His glorious body, according to the working by which He is able even to subdue all things to Himself. **EVERYONE NEEDS A HERO, ESPECIALLY LITTLE BOYS (MEN IN THIS CASE) AND OUT OF THE PAGES OF SCRIPTURE I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT NOT JUST ONE, BUT 3. 1. THE POWER OF GOD THAT PETER HAD ON HIS LIFE: A. WALKED ON WATER- MATT 14:29 Matthew 14:29 (NKJV) 29 So He said, ""Come."" And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus. B. PREACHED AND 3K WERE SAVED-ACTS 2 VS 36-41 Acts 2:36-41 (NKJV) 36 ""Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ."" 37 Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, ""Men and brethren, what shall we do?"" 38 Then Peter said to them, ""Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call."" 40 And with many other words he testified and exhorted them, saying, ""Be saved from this perverse generation."" 41 Then those who gladly received his word were baptized; and that day about three thousand souls were added to them. C. MY FAVORITE PASSAGE- ACTS 5:15-16- HE HAD SO MUCH POWER OF GOD ON HIM THAT PEOPLE WOULD BRING SICK PEOPLE TO THE EDGE OF THE STREET SO THAT HIS SHADOW MAY FALL ON THEM AND THEY BE HEALED- THAT IS POWER OF GOD MY FRIENDS Acts 5:15-16 (NKJV) 15 so that they brought the sick out into the streets and laid them on beds and couches, that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might fall on some of them. 16 Also a multitude gathered from the surrounding cities to Jerusalem, bringing sick people and those who were tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all healed. 2.

So am I. 23 Are they ministers of Christ?--I speak as a fool--I am more: in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths often. 24 From the Jews five times I received forty stripes minus one. 25 Three times I was beaten with rods; once I was stoned; three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I have been in the deep;"
Isaiah 6:1-9,"('Faith', 'Confession', 'Commission', 'Cleansing')",Foursquare," Three-Dimensional Faith Isaiah 6:1-9 I grew up my whole life under the Protestant wing of the faith. My family attended the Methodist church as I was growing up. I came to know Jesus as my Savior and Lord while attending an Assembly of God home fellowship. Later I attended an Assembly of God church. Afterwards I helped to form the first Calvary Chapel in Las Vegas, which later became a non-denominational church. I went to seminary and graduated with a Masters of Theology and Talbot School of Theology, the graduate program of Biola, and received my Masters of Divinity equivalence degree at Fuller Theological Seminary. After receiving my Masters in Theology I returned to my old church in Las Vegas, Hallelujah Christian Fellowship, and took over as its senior pastor. After 10 years we brought the church under the Foursquare denomination. I then moved to Mesquite, Nevada, where I pastor a Foursquare church. You might say I've seen my share of denominationalism and what I've found is that we need to become a whole lot more biblical in our faith and calling, and a whole lot less denominational. When I say we have to become more biblical in our faith and less denominational, this comes from the many conversations I've had over the years. I'd like to focus on two of them with you. The first was when I was thinking about attending seminary, I went to a friend who owned a Christian bookstore and asked him for a book on Theology. He asked if I was a Calvinist or an Arminiest. Having no idea what he was talking about I said, ""Neither, I'm a Biblicist."" He just kind of chuckled. The second incident happened when I was in seminary. A theology professor took a stance that Calvinism was correct in every area. Afterwards I asked if I could meet with him, and asked why he didn't mention the other Scriptures that spoke against the Calvinist stance. He said, ""Dennis, I believe that the majority of the Scriptures support this position."" I then asked if there were other Scriptures that supported an opposing point of view, why then didn't he give a balanced view of God's word. This is what denominationalism does. It teaches as gospel doctrinal positions rather than teaching the whole of God's word and acknowledging that we're not going to know everything that goes on in the mind of God. In other words, there needs to be a lot more balance in the teaching of God's word, and not just denominational talking points. In the church there's a whole lot of formalism and control over everything that is of God, and in the process we have lost a lot of the zeal that God would desire for us to have; a zeal for God's word, a zeal for prayer, a zeal for the Holy Spirit, a zeal of the lost, and a zeal for God's calling. There is a quotation I've heard and believe to be true, and that is the church today is so subnormal that the church we read about in the New Testament seems abnormal. In other words, what was once considered normal and God's plan and purpose for the church now seems abnormal if kept. Wes Watkins commented on Jan 23, 2017 I have had the opportunity over the past three decades to be blessed by several noteworthy Pastors/Teachers.  The manner in which Dennis divides God's Word, brings it to life, and leads one to personal application is a unique Spiritual gift.

Luke 4:144-30,"('Jubilee', 'Kingdom Of God')",Lutheran," Introduction When I was young, the kids in the neighborhood would occasionally play a game called, ""King of the Mountain."" We would use the giant piles of snow, which were made by plowing the streets and parking lots. The object of the game was to get to the top of the mountain before anyone else. Usually this was accomplished by pushing the other kids down, while climbing up the mountain and avoid being pushed down ourselves. ""King of the Mountain"" is a microcosm of life especially in the United States. We spend our days climbing up our little mountains. In our ascent, there are times when we use and abuse others, and times when we push others down. We are convinced that this is the only way to play the game and to reach that elusive goal called ""success."" Jesus enters our world and teaches us a different way to play the game. The Beginning Today's story takes place in Jesus' hometown, Nazareth. Recently Jesus had returned from the wilderness and his encounter with Satan. ""Then Jesus, filled with the power of the Spirit, returned to Galilee"" (Luke 4:14). Jesus' message is different from John the Baptist's. You might recall, from last Sunday, that John called people to ""Repent and be baptized for the forgiveness of sin."" Though Luke doesn't record Jesus' theme, we know from the gospel of Mark that Jesus called the people to repentance because the kingdom of God had arrived. ""The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news"" (Mark 1:15). Jesus understood himself to be not only the incarnation of God, but also the manifestation (epiphany if you will) of the kingdom of God. He underscores this good news in this teaching to his family, friends and neighbors in Nazareth. He says, ""Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing"" (Luke 4:21). Jesus invites people to follow him and learn to live in God's kingdom in the present. He then begins to describe what God's kingdom looks like. The Good News of Jubilee Luke has Jesus officially begin his ministry in Nazareth. Jesus is in his home town and is in the synagogue for the Sabbath. The people had heard what he had already done in other small towns. They were anxious to hear what Jesus had to say. Jesus quotes a passage from the prophet Isaiah. ""The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,/ because he has anointed me/ to bring good news to the poor./ He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives/ and recovery of sight to the blind,/ to let the oppressed go free,/ to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor."" (Luke 4:18-19). These verses were first spoken to the Exiles as they waited to return to the Promised Land. The words describe the Year of Jubilee. This was a time when debts were forgiven and land returned to its original owner. (The concept would be similar to stopping a game of Monopoly in mid game and returning everything to the way it was in the beginning.) In the Year of Jubilee there would be equity, freedom, health, and an overflowing of God's blessings. Isaiah's words were overwhelmingly good news to the Exiles and also to the Nazarenes who heard Jesus speak them that Sabbath."
Hebrews 11:32-12:3,"('Persecution', 'Victory', 'Faithfulness')",Christian/Church Of Christ," MELVIN NEWLAND, MINISTER RIDGE CHAPEL, KANSAS, OK (The PowerPoints used with this message are available for free. Just email me at mnewland@sstelco.com & request #307.) TEXT: Hebrews 11:32-12:3 ""It will be worth it all when we see Jesus, Life's trials will seem so small when we see Christ; One glimpse of His dear face all sorrow will erase, So bravely run the race till we see Christ."" Those words make a beautiful song, but some of the Jewish Christians to whom the letter of Hebrews was written were not sure that it was really worth it all to continue following Jesus. As Jews they had endured cruel persecutions at the hands of both the Syrians & the Romans. But after they had become Christians, the persecutions were worse than before. Not only were they being persecuted by the Romans, but now as Christians, they were also being persecuted by the Jews themselves. So all through the letter of Hebrews, the author seeks to encourage them - to help them understand that being a Christian is really worth it all. He reminds them that those who have been faithful to God have always faced persecution, but that the end result will be a glorious victory even beyond their imagination. In Hebrews 11:32-34 he says, ""What more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson and Jephthah, about David and Samuel and the prophets, who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; ""who shut the mouths of lions, quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies. He continues on in vs's 36-38, ""Some faced jeers and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. They were put to death by stoning; they were sawed in two; they were killed by the sword. ""They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated - the world was not worthy of them."" Then in the next few verses he tells them to do 3 simple things. #1, Remember your heritage; #2, Throw off everything that hinders; & #3, Fix your eyes on Jesus. Listen as we go on to chapter 12, vs's 1, 2, & 3. ""Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us. ""Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. ""Consider Him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart."" What a heritage is ours - not only all the heroes of our faith - but most of all, Jesus Christ, our Savior & our Lord! I. REMEMBER YOUR HERITAGE Paul tells them that it is important for them to remain faithful because of the example, the witness of all who have gone before. And he portrays it like they are in a race, & the stands are filled with those who have already run the race & won the victory."
"Nehemiah 2:17-18, Nehemiah 2:15-16","('Risk', 'Trust & Wait', 'Take A Risk')",Baptist," Nehemiah 2:17, 18 - Nehemiah 6:15, 16 It Was Nobody But God When something happens, we want to know the outcome. We don't you want me to take all day. We want the details, so hurry up and make your point. And that goes for every part of our lives, even at a time like this. Even right now, you want the message to speed up, get to the point and let's go home. But when it comes to the things of God, we must go thru the process. Back in the day, they used to sing about You Can't Hurry God, Oh no, You just have wait, we have to trust Him and give Him Time, No matter How long it takes, because He's a God that You Can't Hurry, He'll Be there, You Don't Have to Worry, But He May Not Come When You Want Him, but He's right on time. I just believe that somebody here today is dealing with a challenge, and you want to know, how long it will take before your situation changes. You want to know, how long will it take for you to do what you want to do? HOLD UP. STOP RIGHT THERE. PUMP YOUR BRAKES, SLOW DOWN AND PULL OVER. The question to ask ourselves is, what WE WANT TO DO, is it God, or is it just a good idea? Is it for self promotion, or is the desire motivated out of genuine concern for something greater than ourselves? These are questions for all of us to consider. In the text, we find a man named Nehemiah that went thru some of the very same things, but in the process, he recognizes, and he comes to understand, that despite the desires of his heart, despite challenge that he would face, in the end, IT WAS NOBODY BUT GOD. From last week's lesson, in Chapter 1, Nehemiah received the bad news of how life is going in his homeland, Jerusalem. He knows that the temple has been rebuilt, but the wall surrounding the temple is still broken down. To have a temple, without a wall, left the city unprotected and shameful. That was not a good thing. After Nehemiah got over his time of sadness, his level of deep concern kicked in. He had to do something about it, but his first course of action came thru His allegiance to God, and thru prayer and fasting. It was a time for him to acknowledge who God was to him, and to seek God's direction. He confessed the sins of his ancestors, as well as his own sins. He remembered the promise made to Moses and God honored His promise in that IF, they transgressed, they would be scattered abroad among the nations. But IF they returned to God, He would bring them together, to the chosen place, where God set His Name. Nehemiah committed himself to REBUILD THAT WALL! Is there anybody, in the house this morning, that's ready to rebuild. Are you ready to partner with God to fix that which is broken? It may not be a wall, but you know what it is, and whatever it is, God IS ABLE. When HE brings it to pass, it won't be out of our own strength, it won't be you money, it wont be your education, it won't be you colleagues, confidants, comrades or constituents. It will be NOBODY BUT GOD. As time moves on, Nehemiah continues in his commitment and his window of opportunity opened, but he had to take a RISK. He had to seize the moment. He"
1 Samuel 8:1-22,"('Election', 'Kingship Of God', 'Political Freedom', 'Bad Choices')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Message: We have been witness to a national election in America. It was a very volatile and divisive election. What we saw played out in the United States is as old as time. The Bible points us to a time when Israel wanted to be like other nations. We see in their actions ancient facts reflected as a modern parable for elections in our time. They were not content to be subject to God and His laws, they wanted an earthly king like the other nations had. They willingly decided to forsake God. God listened to them and then God told Samuel to tell them what life would look like under an earthly king. The contrast was startling but still the Israelites cried out for an earthly king instead of their Heavenly King. 1 Samuel 8 We see in their example how we as broken and sinful people resist being subject to a faithful, loving and holy God. We behave like little children who want their own way. We refuse to obey and trust what our Heavenly Father tells us. The results in America this election may change some aspects of government in that country but it will not change the fact that the people remain in rebellion to God. They like us and so many other countries in the world are living out the cycle of sin as it is clearly displayed for us in the Book of Judges. As long as they served the Lord there was peace in the land. But when Israel did evil in the eyes of the Lord she was punished and enslaved. Then they cried out for release and God raises up a judge to lead them. The nation is then delivered and the cycle repeats itself. The eminent Scottish scholar, and Professor Alexander Tytler taught that this cycle affects all human societies equally. He noted that people go from spiritual faith to courage to liberty to abundance then to selfishness, complacency then apathy and dependence and then into bondage. This pattern repeats itself over and over again throughout history in all models of human government. America has been a living example of Professor Tytler's observations in our time. It is teetering on the edge and nearly imploding. For this reason the people have cried out and as expected they have looked to another human being to solve their dilemma instead of repenting and turning to God. The entire world is now watching to see what direction America will take. God instructed Samuel to give full disclosure to the people of Israel regarding the consequences of having an earthly king. It is a depressing list that details how one's personal property is confiscated and forfeited to the king. It not only speaks of the loss of personal property but also of sons and daughters becoming the property of the king. In short, when we put another sinful human being to rule over us we become that person's property and we lose our personal freedom because sin rules within the human heart and even the best of our leaders are still contaminated with sin. Mark 7:20 Strangely societies have preferred this model of subjugation over the freedom we have when we live under Gods law instead of mans. In fact we embrace this unbroken cycle of sin just as Israel did."
Isaiah 9:1-7,"('Chaos', 'Sovereign God', 'Future Destiny', ""God's Sovereignty"", 'Prophecy Fulfilled')",Presbyterian/Reformed," To Be Announced Isaiah 9:1-7 There are times when people wait anxiously for news because the news can have great consequences for many people. Waiting for the results of a Presidential election for instance. Depending on who wins will determine the fate of the nation. Lately my wife and I have been enjoying a T.V. show about Queen Elizabeth II called ""The Crown"". In this show we see historical events lived out as fate and providence twist and turn in determining her future. Freewill also enters into the picture but much of the future remains unknown as events change their color as quickly as a chameleon. At one moment things could go this way or that way or involve any number of individuals. Changing one seemingly insignificant event in this chain of events will have impacted the future considerably. American mathematician and meteorologist Edward Lorenz gave a name for this, he called it ""the butterfly effect"". ""The butterfly effect is the concept that small causes can have large effects. Initially, it was used with weather prediction but later the term became a metaphor used in and out of science.[1]"" Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect ""Philip Merilees of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , explains it this way... ""Does the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas? "" Source: same A movie in 2004 had this same title ""the butterfly effect"". This Butterfly Effect is just part of a more complex mathematical theory that is commonly known as the Chaos Theory. It goes like this... ""Chaos: When the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future. Does that sound like double talk to you? It sure does to me. Basically a mathematical outcome is determined by a present set of rules that give exact future outcomes. A small change in that mathematical equation anywhere will result in different outcomes but those outcomes can be determined by studying the changes in the equation or the resulting chaos along the way. I know I do not understand this clearly I usually got a C- or worse in math but I get the idea that the metaphor was presenting. A tiny butterfly flapping its wings can have an effect that is felt in a faraway place. What science is saying is that they can predict that effect before it happens. They can tell us when something is ""To be announced"". They use this theory to give us the weather report so you can see they make the theory complicated enough to give them wiggle room for when they say it will be sunny and instead it rains. Once this theory was presented as science people of faith became interested as well. Theologian physicists began to take on this theory and weigh it against our concepts of predestination, providence and chance found in the bible. One such physicist William Pollard asked ... ""Does God throw dice?"" For Pollard biblical and scientific descriptions of the same events were complementary, and ""chance"" was encompassed within the divine providence."" END Quote"

1 Peter 1:3-12,"('Hope', 'Living Hope', 'Exuberance', 'Hope For Future')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Hope for Heaven and Earth 1 Peter 1:3-12 As we begin Advent and look to the Hope that is ours, we must look to the words of St. Peter in 1 Peter Chapter 1. There is far more in this chapter to speak of than time affords me this morning so we will just look at the Hope held out to us and how even Angels in Heaven long to look into this wonderful truth. Firstly all praise goes to the Father from whom all things come including this wonderful Hope that is ours. Jesus is the agent of this hope made real for us by His resurrection from the grave. That resurrection has given us a new birth that was unattainable until Jesus made a way for us. It is for us a living Hope one that made us alive by the new birth but also one that sustains us even now and carries us to its fullness when we step into eternal life with our Lord Jesus. St. Peter describes what waits for us as an inheritance. An inheritance is something we receive when one of our family members bequeaths something that was once theirs to us as a result of their dying. Jesus passes onto us this eternal life which is our living hope. This Hope is alive always, it can never perish, spoil or fade. No wonder such wondrous hope as this draws even the curiosity and interest of the Angels in Heaven. It is not that this hope is inexplicable but rather that it is so miraculous as it rests entirely in Jesus Christ. This inheritance is not for us to possess at this time but it is being kept for us by our Heavenly Father in Heaven. It is He who protects us and shields us in this present day until the day comes when Jesus returns at His Second Advent and His salvation is revealed in its fullness at His coming. There was once a Scotsman who understood this fully and who being economical with his money wanted to save some expense on his head stone. He had the monument carved with a single word - KEPT -. In that one word he realized that it was His Heavenly Father who was keeping him shielded and protected while on earth and it was a heavenly inheritance from the Son of God that was being kept for him in Heaven. Source: J. Vernon McGee pg. 680 Vol. V. Thru the Bible 1983 Thomas Nelson Publishers, Nashville Tennessee. Never doubt dear Christian that you are being kept by a Father who loves you. This world may assail and assault you but you can still stand as God keeps you shielded from the very worst of it. The troubles and difficulties we now experience are just the flame of the furnace that purifies us like gold. There are things within us that only trouble and difficulty can remove from us. Once they are removed what is pure and genuine is revealed and we praise God for having refined us so that we can more fully rejoice in the salvation that is ours through Jesus Christ as He is revealed in these Last Days. The hope that is ours is Jesus Christ. Our faith in Him grows because we love Him even though we cannot see Him we still believe in Him ""and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy"" 1 Peter 1:8 I think it is this inexpressible joy that overcomes so many of us at this time of year as we celebrate Advent."
Matthew 10:34-39,"('Faith', 'Opposition To Christ', 'Family And Faith', 'Conflicts')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Let there be Peace on Earth Many of you probably know this familiar song often heard this time of year; Let there be peace on earth And let it begin with me; Let there be peace on earth, The peace that was meant to be. With God as our Father Brothers all are we, Let me walk with my brother In perfect harmony. Let peace begin with me, Let this be the moment now; With every step I take, Let this be my solemn vow To take each moment and live each moment In peace eternally. And let it begin with me. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_There_Be_Peace_on_Earth_(song) This song has a powerful sentiment that is very much welcomed during the Christmas season. I like it because it identifies where peace must begin. ""Let it begin with me"" but it fails to connect us with the author of such a wonderful peace it fails to connect us to Jesus. The theme for this second week of Advent is peace. We as Christians look to the Prince of Peace who is described for us in Isaiah 9:6 where His reign of peace is described as yet to come. This wonderful verse of scripture is often used at this time of year as we celebrate our Lord's Advent... His coming to earth in Bethlehem born to a virgin in a humble manger. The peace that is mentioned in Isaiah is for a time that is yet to come a future revelation of Jesus we call the Day of the Lord, Jesus Second Advent. Peace at that time will come to the whole earth but only after a great battle where the enemies of God are overcome by the Prince of Peace. To truly understand the peace that Jesus brings at Christmas we have to look to His words in Matthew 10:34-39. It is in these words of Jesus that we come to realize that Jesus first Advent was meant to usher in different kind of peace between man and our Heavenly Father. It would be a peace that is disruptive and conflicting to the rest of the world because it is so remarkable and unique. Jesus came that we might have peace as individuals, an eternal and abiding peace for our souls. Such a peace is revolutionary in nature as it does not rely on religion or creed but on simple faith. Jesus would purchase peace for us through His own sacrifice in order to redeem us for God. Jesus would purchase souls with His blood. What a strange way to bring about peace. Matthew 10:34-39 NIV 34 ""Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. 35 For I have come to turn ""'a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law-- 36 a man's enemies will be the members of his own household.' 37 ""Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. 38 Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. 39 Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it. What are we to make of Jesus words concerning the sword that He brings? A sword is an offensive weapon it is not a shield. A sword does the cutting."
Luke 2:8-20,"('Nativity', 'Messengers Of God', 'Supernatural Events', 'Shepherds And Angels')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Unlikely Messengers Luke 2:8-20 The Advent telling draws us back each year by its poignant beauty revealing ever deeper things. We see our Heavenly Father illuminating the knowledge of the Wise men using a star. Allowing them to identify the place where Jesus the Messiah would be born. Then Shepherds watching their sheep at night are given the honor to proclaim the birth of the Good Shepherd to the world. Is there an intentional metaphor here for us? Our Heavenly Father had watched over us throughout the darkness of our humanity but now He would send His own Son by cover of night clothed in human form to deliver us from our darkness. Maybe there is more here for us to discover? If you had big news to share with the world how would you go about it? Call a televised press conference, give it to Wiki-Leaks, or send out an email, Tweet or maybe a Facebook message? O.K. imagine that you have no such technology and that you are living in the first century A.D. Naturally you would tell the local shepherds - right? Shepherds were usually far removed from cities or towns. They often had to take the sheep to watering holes and grazing areas far from homes especially in the dry moths. They would not get the news of the city but they might from time to time encounter a caravan as it passed by and learn about what was going on in the world. Otherwise they were cut off from the world. For Shepherds to be the heralds of the Messiah's birth made sense. If they had some kind of wilderness news to tell you could be sure that no one else had such information. But we must not forget about the supernatural that surrounds their informant. Luke tells us in verse nine that ""the angel of the Lord came upon them"" well that usually is a reference to Gabriel. It would also be consistent with Mary's experience when she was visited. Luke 1:19 & 26 What happened to these Shepherds was no campfire yarn. We are told ""and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. These events read a lot like a modern day ""close encounter of the third kind"". The Shepherds respond in a very normal way, ""they were sore afraid."" Luke 2:9 Then Gabriel states the obvious...""Fear not"". At this point it's safe to say that Gabriel had their full attention. The message is not one of condemnation but of congratulations ""I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people."" Luke 2:10 While this clarification was most likely welcomed news the big news was the biggest ever in the history of the world to this date. ""For to you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour (Messiah) which is Christ the Lord."" Just so the Shepherds wouldn't mistakenly seek out just any baby they are given a sign to look for a very distinct and unique sign involving a manager. Not the usual place to look for a new born baby. After they are told where and how to find this Saviour suddenly a multitude of the Heavenly host appear with the Angel of the Lord praising God, saying... ""Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men."" Luke 2:11"
John 1:29-42,"('Repent', 'Wilderness', 'Point To Jesus', 'Witness Christ', 'Repent And Believe')",Presbyterian/Reformed," We have found the Messiah John 1:29-42 Today we come together to worship in our church because we are people who have found the Messiah. While this may seem like an obvious statement, there is much more to it. Looking to today's scripture passage we discover some very interesting things. Andrew who was a follower of John the Baptist is at the Jordan River when Jesus is pointed out to him not once but twice. The first time is in; John 1:29 29 The next day John (the Baptist) saw Jesus coming toward him and said, ""Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! The second instance is a day later; John 1:35-36 29 The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, ""Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! On both occasions Jesus is described exactly the same way. Why is this important and why should we find it interesting? As worshipers of God we are first followers of our Heavenly Father. That means we are people of ""The Book"" the Bible. The Jews of Jesus day were no different they used the Bible just as we do except for the New Testament. At the time of John the Baptist followers of God were looking for and anticipating the arrival of a Messiah. Just like us they searched the scriptures for clues that would point to His coming. Quite literally John the Baptist has the Messiah pointed out to him by the Holy Spirit and then John the Baptist points out the Messiah for his followers. Please note that even before Jesus arrived on the scene that many people were anxious to get right with God. That's why John the Baptist was at the Jordan River baptising folks. John was the one who was preparing the way. This lines up with what the Bible said would happen before the Messiah was to be revealed. (700 years before John the Baptist was born) Isaiah 40:3 A voice of one calling: ""In the wilderness prepare the way for the LORD; make straight in the desert a highway for our God."" When I read this passage I am encouraged to discover that people were wanting to be right with God even before Jesus was identified as the Messiah. Sadly we do not see a similar desire in people today. Many people are quick to say they are spiritual but few will say they want to truly know God or get right with Him. We now stand in a very similar world, one that is interested in spiritual things but one that is not interested in the One True God. Folks pick and choose what they like or don't like concerning spirituality and they cobble together their own religion or theology instead of embracing the One True God. You could say that the people of our time are living in a spiritual wilderness. The strange thing is that we just like John the Baptist are the ones standing in that wilderness at the river's edge as we point out Jesus to the world. This was John the Baptist's ministry to be a pointer. Now I know your Mom may have told you that it's impolite to point but in this case it has eternal ramifications. Many of us had an interest in God and spirituality before we had Jesus pointed out to us as the Messiah, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world."

The priests(& ark) stood in the middle of the Jordan until 'all' the aforementioned things took place...""until everything was finished."" All these things were commanded of Joshua by the LORD. These things were also what Moses had commanded Joshua to do. Did Moses & Joshua have prior knowledge of the coming miracle? I believe both Moses & Joshua were just being faithful, trusting God's ability to fulfill His word in whatever way He chose. They believed & trusted & knew God would use them in some way to regardless of the impossibility of the task at hand! They KNEW the LORD would do something spectacular thru their faithfulness. As the saying goes...'Let go & let God.' Anxiety can come with Completion of any task. It means that another sometimes unanticipated phase is about to be entered. And the next phase requires change.

Genesis 1:1-2:3,"('Abraham', 'Jacob', 'Joseph', 'God Created All')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Creation, Sin, and More Sin The Beginning of It All Gen 1:1-2:3 David Taylor December 10, 2016 Today we start working through the book of Genesis, the first book of the bible. I will split the book up into three series, chapters 1-11 which centers on the beginning of history; 12-36 which centers on the Patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and 37-50, which centers on the story of Joseph. The series we start today is ""Creation, Sin, and More Sin"" covering the first eleven chapters. In these chapters you see God creating all things, the fall of humanity into sin, and then the uncontrollable spread of sin like a virus. Today I want us to look at ""The beginning of it All,"" in Genesis 1. God Created All Things The bible starts out telling us how it all began with a summary statement, ""In the beginning God created the heavens and earth."" God created tells us that the world is not the product of chance, the random forming of molecules. Modern man believes that creation evolved accidentally over millions of years and that the material world is all there is. And because this all there is then you live only for this life. In contrast, Genesis tells us that creation has a starting point, it has a purpose, and that purpose points us to a Creator. Genesis also tells us that God created. That word created is only used of God in the bible. The creation account also tells us that the material world has a spiritual component because all of creation is connected and in relationship to it's Creator. All of it is under his dominion, his rule, and designed for his purposes. Homer has some very talented and creative people who can create some amazing things. You see this with the artisans selling items at the Nutcracker Fair. Genesis tells us that God created the world with created with purpose and design. God Created by his Word We read that God created by the power of his word out of nothing. Eight times the bible says there was nothing and then there was something because God said so. God did not need raw materials as we do. He said it and it was so. God's word has the power to accomplish this because God is the one speaking. Nothing hinders God's word because his word is a person, his Son Jesus Christ. God speaks by his word, together with his Spirit, to create. God's word, by God's Spirit, creates and sustains all things. In creation God's word overcame the emptiness, darkness, and chaos. If I want light I have to flip a switch. All God did was say, 'let there be light and there was light.' I have to use raw materials to create. I told you last week I made a new top to my pop up camper but I could not make it out of nothing, I used raw materials. God did not use anything to create. God created everything out of nothing by the power of his word. God Created an Ideal Habitat God begins by creating a habitat and then fills it with inhabitants. He creates light and day and night, sun and moon, water and dry land. Did you notice that light comes before the sun and moon. Some say that this shows that this account of creation is an error and therefore not inspired by God but this shows that God does not need them to make light because God is light and this is the light of his glory. Then God fills his creation with plant life and living creatures creating an ideal habitat, made for the flourishing of life. And then God blessed the living creatures with the ability to multiply and fill the earth."
Genesis 1:26-28,"('Human Life', 'Image Of God')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Creation, Sin, and More Sin The Image of God and the Value of Human Life Gen 1:26-28 David Taylor December 17, 2016 Emil Brunner said that ""the most powerful of all spiritual forces is man's view of himself, the way in which he understands his nature and his destiny; indeed it is the one force which determines all the others which influence human life. Plato pictures Socrates as a man obsessed in his quest for wisdom - namely, to know himself. But herein lies the problem for all of us, outside of divine revelation, we are incapable of knowing ourselves, our destiny, and our rightful place in the scheme of things. So let's look at what the bible say about the image of God. Human Life is Unique to all Creation The whole account of creation builds up to the creation of humanity. Humanity is the pinnacle of God's creative handiwork. You see a change in the flow of chapter one at verse twenty six, ""then, God said let us make man in our own image."" And because prose is not sufficient Moses must use poetry to show the grandeur of the subject matter. God has not said anything like this about the rest of creation. All this points to the uniqueness of humanity compared to the rest of creation. When I want to express my love and affection in an extraordinary way to Karen, I use poetry because it communicates my love more effectively than just saying it. Moses, who wrote Genesis, used poetry to describe the creation of humanity to emphasize our uniqueness over all the rest of creation. This is contrary to the well known philosopher, Peter Singer, who wrote a book in 1979 called Animal Liberation where he argued that we ought to extend to animals the same equality of consideration that we extend to humans. Yet I wonder what Singer would do if a child and their dog fell off a cliff and he was sent to rescue them. Who would he rescue first? Animals are magnificent creatures and I am frequently in awe of them. But none of them are on par with humans. My cat does not question whether attacking the shrew or vole is right or wrong. She is not even thinking about it because she is acting on instinct without any moral compass. Humanity is unique in all creation. Human Life is Sacred As we saw last week, being created in the image of God means that humanity uniquely reflects God. The stamp of the divine image means that every human life is sacred. Every human being has intrinsic value not just because of what they do or contribute but just because they are human. Remember, that word is where we get the word icon. An icon represents something else like a logo. Another metaphor to describe the divine image in humanity comes from ""St. Gregory of Nyssa, the 4th century bishop who wrote: 'The measure of what is accessible to you is in you, for thus your Maker from the start endowed your essential nature with such good. God has imprinted upon your structure replicas of the good things in his own nature, as though stamping wax with the shape of a design.' In ancient times, people signed documents by putting hot wax on the paper and pressing into the wax a seal carved with their unique design. The wax then bore the seal's imprint and showed that the document was theirs. God is like the seal, and our human nature is like the wax that shows forth the same design as God, but on a smaller scale. The wax receives the imprint by direct contact with the seal, and the copy receives its likeness to the model by direct contact with it. So God is present within his image, making it to be an image of God."" So being created in the image of God means that all human life has the thumb print of God on them so that every life sacred, even malformed life."

1 Timothy 3:1-16,"('Maturity', 'Christian Maturity')",Anglican," Sermon from Rev George Hemmings Yesterday was a very important day for Australia. Yesterday, we exercised our power to elect a new government. Regardless of what you thought about the main candidates and parties, or their policies, voting is a great privilege and a big responsibility. We get to decide who our leaders should be. Here at St. Thomas' we regularly face the same question. We're about to start a new playgroup, and one of the things we've got to work out is who should be the leader? Earlier this year we had to ask, who should we appoint as our Mandarin minister? Every year we have to ask ourselves who will be our leaders on vestry? In a few years, when we let Chris retire, we'll have to work out who should replace him? Who should serve as a warden? And who should lead our bible studies, our music ministry, our kids clubs and Sunday school? But what should we look for in our leaders? Well, the question of leadership was one that the church in Ephesus was also grappling with. If you remember back to chapter one, the church had been troubled by false teachers, who were promoting things other than the true gospel. They'd been leading people off course. They'd caused all sorts of damage within, and without, the church. As a result two of them, Hymenaeus and Alexander, had been expelled by Paul. The question the church faced was who should replace them? Who in their right mind would want the job? Leadership he says is no small thing, it's not to be entered into lightly. But despite the disrepute that the others might've brought to the role, desiring to be a leader is to desire a noble thing. Leading God's church involves the care and nurture of God's people. It is a good work, a great honour. But just having a desire to lead isn't enough. Paul goes on to describe what we should look for when appointing leaders. In doing so, Paul talks about two types of leaders, translated in the NRSV as 'bishops' and 'deacons'. The terms he uses though are literally 'overseer' and 'servant'. He doesn't go into much detail about the different roles and what they involve. So we have to be careful not to jump to thinking he's talking about bishops and deacons in a modern, Anglican sense. It's safer to think of what he has to say as addressing any leaders who oversee or manage a ministry or church, and those who assist in leading, perhaps in doing the hands-on, practical, day to day work. The qualifications Paul describes as being necessary for leadership don't just apply to bishops, priests and deacons as we have them today, but to all leaders within the church. As you may have noticed the requirements for overseers and servants is very similar. This isn't really surprising as you want the same kind of qualities in a leader, no matter what they're in charge of. So it's reasonable to look at the two together. Though of course, with the higher responsibility, they're a higher standard in place."
1 Timothy 4:1-16,"('Godliness',)",Anglican," I want to talk to day about how we can be spiritually healthy. We'll come back to the first few verses later but for now just notice what he says in v6: ""6If you put these instructions before the brothers and sisters, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished on the words of the faith and of the sound teaching that you have followed."" The first thing we need if we're to be spiritually healthy is to make sure we're being nourished on the words of the faith and of the sound teaching that we receive from God's word. But good food isn't enough. On its own it'll just make you fat. No you need to use the food productively. So he says: ""Train yourself in godliness, 8for, while physical training is of some value, godliness is valuable in every way, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come. 9The saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance."" Training in godliness is something that begins when you first become a Christian and continues for the rest of your life. That's because godliness is the sort of characteristic that needs constant work. You don't just reach a certain stage of godliness where you can sit back and coast along. It isn't like learning to ride a bike. No, training in godliness is a lifelong task for the Christian if we're to remain spiritually healthy. Have you noticed how often a football or cricket commentator appears on TV, someone who used to be sleek and fit, but they've now developed a paunch or are looking a bit chubby in the cheeks. What's happened, you see, is that they've stopped training. You see it in those nostalgia games that we get every year with stars of the past dusting off their creams or their footy boots and trundling around the field trying not to make a fool of themselves. What those games show, apart from how age catches up with all of us, is that if we stop training we quickly lose our fitness and skill levels. So Paul's warning Timothy here to keep up his training in godliness for the same reason. If we get out of training our fitness level, or in this case, our godliness, will fall off. What is Godliness? Well, what is godliness? At its simplest, godliness is taking on God's character. It's imitating God. This has been the essence of godly living from the earliest times. The Old Testament law was premised on this injunction: ""Be holy for I am holy."" In the New Testament it's the same. In Eph 4:24 God tells us to clothe ourselves ""with the new self, created according to the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness."" In Col 3:12 we read: ""As God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience."" The result of us believing in Christ is that Christ's Spirit comes and fills us, enabling us to bear fruit according to his nature. And what is that fruit? ""The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, 23gentleness, and self-control."" (Gal 5:22-23)"
1 Timothy 5:1-25,"('Family', ""Shepherd God's Flock"", 'Family Leadership')",Anglican," Over the last couple of weeks we've looked at the criteria for choosing elders and deacons, we've read Paul's instructions to Timothy to guard his inner life, to train himself in holiness, and now we come to more instructions, this time to do with how he's to relate to others in the congregation and how to arrange the ordering of ministries in the congregation. First we find an instruction about how to deal with older men. The context is one where Timothy might need to rebuke someone, to pull them into line. In such a case he's to be careful not to speak harshly to such a man but rather to exhort him as a father. Now notice first of all that Timothy, as the elder appointed by Paul to lead the church, has a responsibility to keep order in the church. This has been a constant theme throughout the letter: he's to correct and admonish those who might lead the congregation astray. So despite the difficulty he might feel in rebuking an older man, he has to do it. In fact he's to do it at whatever level the person is in terms of seniority. But he's not to do it in an arrogant or harsh manner. Christian Leaders should never consider themselves to be authorities in themselves. No we're always leaders under authority. We're accountable to Jesus Christ our overseer and chief shepherd of the sheep. So he's to treat older men with the respect that's due to them. He's to exhort them as if they were his father. This respect for our elders is something we've largely lost with our egalitarian culture in Australia, but there's a lot to be said for giving those who've gone before us, often pioneering the work in the place where we are now, the respect that they deserve. Similarly he's to treat older women as mothers and those of a similar age to himself as brothers, or sisters. And notice the added warning: ""with absolute purity."" The temptation to use a position of power and authority to attract someone of the opposite sex appears to have been just as great in the first century as it has been more recently. So Paul creates an absolute boundary on the behaviour of Christian leaders - absolute purity. That means purity of mind as much as purity of action. Treat women you minister to as though they were your own sisters. The church would be in a lot less difficulty if ministers had always followed that rule, wouldn't it? Before we move on let me just comment that the sort of behaviour he describes here is really the sort of meekness in leadership that Jesus called for. It's not weakness. In fact it's the opposite. It's leadership that has sufficient strength not to need to force people to behave, because their gentle persuasion is so effective. Paul then moves on to focus on 3 other groupings: widows, elders and, in the next chapter, slaves, and the church's responsibility towards them. And notice that in this chapter, ministry to the congregation and support by the congregation go together. Widows - the principal and the practice Widows were in a difficult situation in Biblical times. Women had no right to own land. It was assumed that they'd be married and be looked after by their husband. So if the husband died they were left destitute, entirely dependent on other family members to care for them. Under Old Testament laws God had provided for widows to marry their husband's brother or nearest relative so they were looked after, but for Christian women in the first century their husband's family may well have disowned them when they became Christians. So this first section deals with these widows and in particular the principle that widows should be honoured."
1 Timothy 6:11-21,"('False Teaching', 'Christian Priorities')",Anglican," Sermon by Rev George Hemmings I wonder what you think the greatest threat facing the church is? Secularism and the push to privatize religion? The rise of militant atheism that's always ready to attack Christianity? Perhaps it's young people with their lack of respect? Or old people stuck in their ways? Globally, we're regularly reminded of the bombing of churches, such as took place in Pakistan recently. We're reminded of the threat of persecution from those outside the church. As we've read through 1 Timothy, we've seen other threats facing the church. Paul constantly charges Timothy to confront the threat posed by false teaching. Flowing from this is the threat posed by poor leadership. There's also the threat of disunity, and of the community failing to care for itself. Three times in the letter, Paul refers to the threat posed by the enemy, by Satan, who prowls around looking for an opportunity to destroy the church. Surely this is the greatest threat, the greatest danger facing the church? But, the truth is, the greatest danger comes from within. The greatest danger is that we allow any of these other things to distract us from the truth. The greatest danger facing the church is that we lose our focus on what counts, that we fail to keep a firm grip on our faith. So in verse 11 Paul repeats his commission to Timothy. He repeats his warning to stay focused, to not to allow anything to draw us away. 'But as for you, man of God, shun all this.' In the first half of chapter 6, Paul describes the effects of following unsound doctrine. (As Ian put it so succinctly last week, bad root results in bad fruit). 'But as for you', indicates there should be a distinction. Those who follow unsound teaching, those who've lost their focus live like this, but as for you, something different is expected. In his charge, Paul address Timothy as 'man of God.' This echoes a term used in the Old Testament of the leaders of God's people. It's vitally important that leaders don't lose their focus, because it's their job to help keep everyone else on track. But that doesn't excuse everyone else. It's just as important that everyone keeps focused on what counts. The first part of that involves shunning, fleeing from, all this. At the very least Paul's referring back to what we saw in chapter 6. We're to totally avoid any teaching that doesn't conform to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ. We're to shun teaching that isn't in accordance with godliness we're meant to be striving for. We can't allow ourselves to be drawn away from the truth. We have to reject pride, envy, slander. And we can't allow the love of money to replace our faith in God. The first part of keeping focused on what counts, is not focusing on anything else. Paul highlights this in his final, emphatic words. In verses 20-21, he warns that by letting themselves be drawn away by false teaching, some have missed the mark!"
John 2:1-11,"('First Miracle', 'Water To Wine')",Anglican," This week we start a new series: this time on John's gospel. We won't cover all of John's Gospel this year but we'll make a good start. We're starting with ch 2 but we will come back to chapter 1 just before Christmas. More than any other book in the Bible probably, John's gospel can be studied over and over again with more being discovered each time we read it. The ideas in it are simple at first sight but then as you examine them you realise that there are deeper and deeper meanings to be found in the images and descriptions that John gives us. Before we begin looking at today's passage, we first need to think about the reason John is writing. What you find, as you work through John's gospel and compare it to the other 3 gospels, is that John leaves out a lot of what they contain and includes quite a bit of material that they don't have. For example, John doesn't have any of the narrative parables that the others have. There's no account of the transfiguration or the institution of the Lord's Supper. There are no reports of Jesus casting out demons; no mention of Jesus' temptations. At the same time, the material found in chs 2 to 4 appears only in John, as do his regular visits to Jerusalem and his dialogues with the Jewish leaders in the Temple and synagogues. Similarly the final discourse to his disciples at the last supper appears only in John. Finally, John records a series of sayings of Jesus which begin with the phrase ""I am"", pointing to Jesus' identification with the God who spoke to Moses at Sinai, identifying himself as ""I am who I am"". So as we come to look at John's gospel it's important that we understand that what we have here is different from the other gospels. It's not any better or worse. It isn't any more or less true an account of Jesus' life. But it is different. John has set out to report on Jesus' life with a particular aim in mind. In fact he tells us what it is. If you turn to the end of John, to John 20:30-31, you'll read this: ""Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book. 31But these are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life in his name."" So John's aware that there's much more that could have been written, but he's selected this collection of sayings and actions, words and works, for the specific purpose of bringing people to belief in Jesus as the Messiah, and as the Son of God, so that through that belief they might have life in Jesus' name. Now knowing that that's why John writes should help us as we study his gospel to understand better what we find here. That's certainly true of today's passage. John 2:1-11. What we're told as we read this report of this wedding at Cana in Galilee, of the changing of water into wine, is that this is the first of the signs that Jesus performed. Now that's a clue straight away. In the other gospels the word used for Jesus miracles is more often mighty works or works of power, or wonders or miracles. But in John they're always signs. That is, special actions by which Jesus reveals his glory to those who believe and which confront others with the need to decide about him."
John 2:12-25,"(""God's House"", 'Cleansing Of Temple')",Anglican," Two weeks ago, we looked at John's account of Jesus at a wedding in Cana. And now this week, he's travelling on to Jerusalem for the Passover. But before we look any further, please pray with me. I have a riddle for you. Why is a metcard like an Old Testament temple? What do the two things have in common? They both represent old systems.They were both used for a certain purpose, but now the method has changed and they've been replaced by a new system. So, given that the Old Testament temple, much like a metcard, is no longer in use, it seems like it wouldn't matter that much to us what Jesus said in John's account that Sophia just read. We don't worship in a temple anymore, we don't make animal sacrifices to God anymore. But I can tell you, Jesus' words to these 1st century believers relate directly to our lives as God's people. But before we think about what Jesus did and said in the temple, let's ask ourselves another question. What did everyone else do and say in the temple? Why did Jews in the first century even go to the temple? What was the point of it? One reason people went there was to offer sacrifices to God, to experience God's forgiveness and to repent of their sin. Another reason was to meet with each other and to learn from Jewish teachers. And another was to draw near to God- it was his dwelling place. But really, the temple had 2 purposes. It was the place where you went to sacrifice to God and ask forgiveness, and it was where you went to meet God in his dwelling place and to learn about God from other people. For the people Jesus is talking to in John's account, the temple is the centre of their life. It's a sacred place and a place they're very familiar with. Which is why it's a bit abrupt and, perhaps even a shock, when Jesus says this: ""Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."" Jesus actually says he's going to destroy God's meeting place. He doesn't think the temple is worth much at all. Maybe he thinks the thing is poorly built. So poorly build that he could do just as good a job in only 3 days. Or maybe he has something else in mind altogether. Something other than an impressive building. ""The Jews then said, 'This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?' But he was speaking of the temple of his body."" John's account says that after Jesus was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered what he had said in the temple. So Jesus has destroyed the temple and rebuilt it in 3 days. But what did he rebuild it as? What did he have in mind when he talked about destroying the temple? It's right there in verse 21. Jesus is predicting his own victory over death. He's hinting at the time when people will come to Jesus as the place where God dwells, not the temple. So now I want to think for a while about the temple primarily as God's dwelling place, and the place where we meet with and learn from other Christians. Jesus' body is now the place where we go for everything that God's people once went to the temple for. But what does that mean for us, almost 2,000 years after Jesus left the Earth? If Jesus' body is the place where God dwells, then where is Jesus' body? With Jesus now in Heaven, not on Earth, the temple seems less accessible than ever, right? So how can Jesus' body be the Temple? He doesn't mean his physical body, because that he took with him. He didn't leave it here. And don't think we don't need a temple any more."
John 4:1-42,"('Holy Spirit', 'Gospel Proclamation', 'Woman At The Well')",Anglican," If you were here last week you may remember how John saw his main role as telling people about Jesus. You may also remember that that task of proclaiming Jesus is also our task. Well today we move on to the next episode in John's account of Jesus' ministry. Here we find Jesus' providing a great model for sharing the gospel. We find Jesus taking every opportunity to bring people to a knowledge of the truth which is found in him, and then we see the woman herself becoming a witness to Christ. And we finish with a reminder that the task of evangelism is ongoing. Jesus has decided to return to Galilee. The most direct route to Galilee passed through the region of Samaria, so that's the way they went. We're told they came to the town of Sychar where Jacob's well was, and still is. It was the sixth hour, that is midday, and being tired from the journey, Jesus sat down to rest while his disciples went into the town to buy some lunch. Just then a Samaritan woman comes to the well to draw water. Now this is strange. No-one goes out in the heat of the day to draw water. That's a job for the morning or evening when it's cool. So why would this woman come now? Maybe, as we'll see later, because she's a social outcast. She comes now so she won't have to bear the looks and comments of the other women from the town. So Jesus is sitting by the well and this woman walks up. What do you think he sees? Most Jewish men of his day would have seen a woman, of doubtful moral character, who, even worse, was a Samaritan. Their first thought would have been to ignore her. Even if she'd been brave enough to speak to them they would have turned away. But what does Jesus see? He sees an opportunity to share the gospel with someone who's in great need of it. Here we start to approach the central theme of this passage. Every opportunity to share the gospel must be taken. I wonder are you like me, in that when you come across someone, you ask yourself this sort of question. Are they good prospects for the gospel? Do they look like promising material, or should you save your energy for someone else and instead just discuss the weather? Well, one of the amazing things about the gospel is that all sorts of people are touched by it, in totally unpredictable ways. I mean, look at this woman. As we'll discover in a moment she'd had 5 husbands already, she was living with a de facto, she had little or no social standing, she would have been looked down on by everyone in town, and yet she's ripe for the harvest. And what's more, having heard the gospel she'll become an evangelist in her turn. So never pass up an opportunity to share the gospel with others. You never know who will respond until you try. Well, Jesus opens the conversation by asking her for a drink; a very down-to-earth, everyday sort of place to begin. This takes the woman by surprise. She would never have expected a Jew to ask a Samaritan for a drink. It was well known that Jews would never share eating or drinking utensils with a Samaritan. If they did they'd be unclean for the rest of the day. But notice what an effective tool this element of surprise is. It raises the interest of the listener and gets the conversation going."
Revelation 8:7,"('Judgement', 'First Trumpet', 'Third Of Vegetation Destroyed', 'Judgment')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 2/22/2016 Series: Verse By Verse Through Revelation Title: First Trumpet: Third of Vegetation Destroyed. (Revelation 8:7) Revelation 8:7 (KJV) 7 The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up. Introduction At the beginning of chapter seven, an angel had called for the angels holding back the four winds to not hurt ""the land or the sea or the trees"" until God's servants had been sealed (7:1-3). But after they had been sealed, God's fury was unleashed upon the earth. As with the seals, the first four trumpets are distinguished from the last three. In this case, the first four are concerned with natural events and the last three with people. The trumpets are further distinguished from the seals in that the trumpets are God's intervention rather than the world's actions upon itself. These trumpets do not describe the final judgment. In each case only part of the world is affected. To John's original readers, though, they are reminded that God will indeed deal with sin--something I wish everyone today was just as aware of. Commentary The angels prepare to blow the trumpets, but only the first trumpet is ""sounded, followed immediately by hail (chunks of ice) and fire (yes, literal fire) mingled (mixed) with blood.""† The Bible is not talking about symbolic fire, not symbolic blood, but real ice, real fire and real blood . . . will fall from the sky upon the earth right here where you and I are today. Jesus had said, ""There will be strange events in the skies--signs in the sun, moon, and stars. And down here on earth the nations will be in turmoil, perplexed by the roaring seas and strange tides. The courage of many people will falter because of the fearful fate they see coming upon the earth, because the stability of the very heavens will be broken up"" (Luke 21: 25-26; nlt). The Flood was used in the first global judgment; now it is going to be fire. This earth is to be purified by fire. The forests and the prairies covered with grass are partially destroyed by fire. Plant life was the first to be created, but it is the first to be destroyed. In the record given in Genesis 1:11, God began with the creation of plant life after order had been brought into the physical globe. One-third* of the earth is burned. One-third of the earth indicates the wide extent of the damage. ""One-third"" means not one-forth or one-half; it means one-third. One-third of all the trees will perish, and one-third of all the green grass will be burned up. One can well imagine how this would affect not only the balance of nature, but also the food supply. With the grass gone, all the livestock would die. The Greek word for trees usually means ""fruit trees,"" they will be burned down; and the destruction of pasture lands would devastate the meat and milk industries. Can you imagine a catastrophe any worse than what has been revealed here in John's vision? If you find it difficult to believe that ice, fire and blood can come down from the sky to fall upon the earth, read Exodus 9:18-25, and remember that God Almighty changes not! He is the same, yesterday, today and forever."
"1 Timothy 1:7, Genesis 3:8-10","('Fear', 'Fear Breeds Fear', 'Evaluate Fear')",Assembly Of God," FEAR BREEDS FEAR... By Wade Martin Hughes, Sr. Kyfingers@aol.com NOTE: There is a healthy fear that is wisdom, such as the fear of God and a healthy respect of situations. This lesson focuses on the danger of excessive fear that can hinder and cripple individuals. COME LET US REASON TOGETHER AT: 1. WHY DOES OUR ENEMY WANT FEAR IN THE CAMP OF GOD? 2. WHAT IS TRYING TO BIRTH FEAR IN THE HEART OF GOD'S PEOPLE? 3. WILL WE TURN OUR SITUATIONS OVER TO GOD AND TRUST HIM TO HANDLE OUR FEAR CASES INTO HIS CARE? Much of failure comes when people make a habit of fear and excuses. FEAR, ANXIETY AND WORRY WERE NOT IN GOD'S PLAN FOR ADAM AND EVE. THE CHOICES THEY MADE RELEASED FEAR... THE FIRST TIME FEAR IS MENTION IN THE BIBLE WAS A RESULTS OF SIN. Genesis 3:8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. 9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? 10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself. THE CHOICE OF DISOBEDIENCE RELEASED CONSEQUENCES... FEAR WAS ONE OF THOSE? WHY ARE YOU HIDING? TEXT: 2 Timothy 1:7 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. WILL WE TAKE AN HONEST EVALUATION OR ASSESMENT OF WHAT FEAR REALLY IS? THEN SEE IF FEAR, ANXIETY IS TRYING TO TAKE ROOT IN OUR DAILY LIFE? FEAR: Fear is a strong emotion. Horror, panic, an unpleasant emotion from a sense of danger, to be afraid, to expect or worry, ANXIETY: fear, nervousness of what might happen, uneasy mind, overwhelming tension WORRY: to afflict with mental distress, to face agitation, to focus and think about problems, thinking that something bad is going to happen, focus on the negative possibilities. STRESS: mental tension, worry over problems. Worry, fear, anxiety and stress can affect your heart, your blood pressure and your nerves. IN THE LAST DAYS, THERE GROWS A TENDANCY, AN ATTITUDE, OR A SPIRIT IN THE HEARTS OF MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN TO ALLOW FEAR AND ANXIETY A GREATER RULE THAT CAN TERRIFY AND PARALYZE THE BEHAVIOR AND FREEDOMS WE ALL HOLD DEAR. Jesus was asked a serious question about the END TIMES... Part of Jesus' answer was very clear --- the TIME IS COMING WHEN FEAR WILL BE A DESTRUCTIVE FORCE AND WILL TRY TO GAIN CONTROL... Luke 21:26 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. Sure the are negative situations trying to SMOTHER OUR FAITH --- BUT LIFT UP YOUR HEAD AND STAY FOCUSED ON THE ETERNAL. Luke 21:28 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh. WORRY MAY BE A SIGN --- YOU DO NOT TRUST GOD... LET US BE HONEST: FEAR IS BONDAGE --- FEAR IS THE ENEMY OF THE FAITH THAT WILL HINDER THE PROMISES OF GOD... BONDAGE: being limited or restrained, the state of being a slave, being bound,"
John 14:15-24,"('Assurance Of Salvation', 'Saved By Grace', 'Righteous Works', 'Kingdom Servant')",Nazarene," Scripture Reading: John 14:15-24 (Please open your Bibles to this text) Last week we took a look the most important question of any moment in time which is, ""If Jesus returns or you go to meet Him, are you ready? Are you saved?"" And we found that it is not only possible but it is the will of Almighty God that you can know for sure that you are saved. You can know with absolute certainty that if you were to meet Jesus today that you would spend eternity in the presence of the Lord. How do we know that? We know from God's Holy Word. John 3:18 ""Whoever believes in Him (Jesus) is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son."" Romans 10:9-10 ""If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. ""For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by confessing with your mouth that you are saved."" 1 John 5:12-13 ""He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life. These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life."" John 6:47 ""Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life."" So, based on these Scriptures and many others we can say for sure that the Lord guarantees eternal life for those who place their faith and trust their very souls to Jesus. Now before we go any further we probably should expand a little on this thought of why we need salvation and the provision that the Father and Son made so that we might have forgiveness and reconciliation and transformation. God is a Holy God - there is no sin or deceit or evil of any kind in Him. There was a time when humanity was sinless; all two of them. And they communed with God and walked with Him, ""in the cool of the evening."" Then they were tempted to doubt what God had told them and they disobeyed the Lord and became sinful. Sin separated them from the Lord. After that God instituted a sacrificial system for sins committed which had to be repeated year after year after year. But, a better sacrifice was needed. We needed to be reconciled to God, but how? He is too Holy and we were too sinful. Was it hopeless??? No it was not hopeless? Why? Because God had a plan! He sent His Son, who lived among us, who lived a sinless, perfect life and then the perfect, sinless, Son of God gave His life on the cross of Calvary and shed His blood as the payment for my sin and your sin and everyone sin. Even though the sacrifice of the Son of God was sufficient and available for the forgiveness of every human who ever lived it was not applied to everyone. Why not? Because we were too sinful to even know we needed it. That's where this thing called Grace came in. Grace reveals our sinfulness to us. Grace draws us like a magnet to Jesus, the only source of forgiveness and reconciliation with God."
Isaiah 58:1-9,"('Seeking Jesus', 'Fasting', 'Heart Attitude', 'Empty Ritual')",Nazarene," Before we go over our memory Scriptures I want to go over a true example of a mistake versus sin as an example of what the difference is and why the Lord looks upon the two differently. Last week we introduced a new memory Scripture and I told you that the new memory Scripture was printed in your bulletin so that you could print it out and put it somewhere where you would be able to see it for the next few months and get it firmly planted into your hearts and minds. In reality I had printed the bulletin inserts before changing the memory Scripture to the new one and had forgotten about it. This is a mistake and not a sin. The action was unintentional and not intended to cause harm to someone else or to elevate myself in someone else's eyes. Even though it was not a sin I felt the need to apologize to you and to the Lord for my failure and the Lord knows and I hope you know that that failure was unintentional and not motivated by any ill intention. John Wesley wrote that those whose hearts were fully given over to the Lord were not free from infirmities nor mistakes. Now if I had knowingly lied to you in order to deceive or harm you or to elevate myself in your eyes that would be sin and sin requires confession and repentance and the seeking of forgiveness from the Lord. I hope this clarifies the difference between a mistake and a sin. But before we leave the subject entirely ... if you sin and in your confession to an offended person or to the Lord and you call it a mistake, is knowingly labeling the sin as a mistake a sin??? Two weeks ago we talked about the amazing gift of the Gospel which is salvation brought about through God's grace and by turning away from sin and placing our faith and trust, in fact our entire soul and lives, in the hands of the Lord. Last week we talked about the inevitable works that would naturally flow out of such a changed life. Naturally such discussion should bring us to examine our own lives. Am I really fully given over to Jesus? Do I love the Lord with all of my heart, soul, mind and strength? Or, am I just acting the part and just hoping that I'm ""saved enough"" to get into heaven? If you ever ask the question, ""How much can I sin and still get into heaven"" you most likely are not saved at all because your desires for the world are still predominate in your life and your desire for heaven is for your own pleasure and not for the glory of God! And, what about these inevitable works that would naturally flow out of a life given over to Jesus? Do you see them in your life? Aside from coming to church on most Sundays do you see any activity flowing out of your life indicating a desire to please the Lord for His benefit and the benefit of His kingdom or do your actions indicate that you are still the center of your life? Perhaps you're wondering what you should do if you find that you are not fully committed to the Lord and His Kingdom? What could you do to break the chains of sin in your life?"
"Hebrews 11:1, 1 Timothy 4:12","('Faith', 'Trust')",Church Of God," --FAITH IN HIM-- 1 Timothy 4:12 12 Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. This week we are going to be talking about faith There has been a few songs written about faith Who can name a few? Faith - George Michael Blind Faith - Chase & Status Ever Had a Little Faith? - Belle & Sebastian Factory of Faith - Red Hot Chili Peppers Faith - Jordin Sparks? Faith - Alejandro Escovedo Faith - Stevie Wonder Faith & Grace - Lucinda Williams Faith (When I Let You Down) - Taking Back Sunday Faith Healer - The Sensational Alex Harvey Band Faith in Love - Air Supply I read a story about a man who had a conversation with a circus trapeze artist. The performer admitted the net underneath was there to keep them from breaking their necks, but added, ""The net also keeps us from falling. He said try to Imagine there is no net. We would be so nervous that we would be more likely to miss and fall. If there wasn't a net,-- we would not dare to do some of the things we do. But because there's a net, we dare to do flips But if we ever fell thank God for the net.... *That is how most Christians live their lives ""We have security in God.-- As our net When we are sure in his arms, ---We dare to attempt big things for God. We dare to be holy. We dare to be obedient. We dare, because we know the eternal arms of God will hold us if we fall."" We have confidence in Him.. You see Faith is all about our confidence in God, and His Word. Faith is at the foundation of our relationship with Him and to our ability to believe Him for our needs. *And sometimes He will put our faith to the test. *He will ask us to risk it all... The reason why He sometimes does this is not to punish us It's because He wants us to truly place our trust and confidence in Him to provide as He has said in His Word. We use faith all the time and don't even realize it When you woke up this morning you had faith that your legs would work when you get out of bed When you get in your car to come here you had faith that it would get you here Some of you all rode the bus you had faith that it would get you here When you came in this room You sit in the chair You had faith it would hold you up.. You see you it's easy to have faith in things you don't even Think about ""God honors radical, risk-taking faith. Listen to some of these heroes in the Bible Hebrews 11:1-11 Text: Hebrews 11:1-3 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. 2 For by it the elders obtained a good report. 3 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. 4 By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous, 5 By faith Enoch was taken away so that he did not see death, ""and was not found, because God had taken him""; 6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him."
"Deuteronomy 28:1-2, Joshua 24:15","('Destiny', 'Divine Direction', 'Step Of Faith', 'Get Over The Past')",Pentecostal," Get Over Your Past: Divine Direction Its a new year, and we have a new preaching theme, Discovering Your Destiny... Is that something you desire to do this year? Discover YOUR Destiny... Discover OUR Destiny... Maybe your thinking, ""Sounds like a nice idea, it would be great to discover and experience all that God has planned and purposed for my life. I want to see change in my life. I'm fed up with living a mediocre Christian Life. I want my days to be different. I want to be amazed and surprised as God draws me closer to Him each and every day."" Or maybe your thinking, ""No, not for me, I don't want to change, I like my life exactly how it is. Every day the same. No surprises. No interruptions from God. No miracles in my life."" God has a perfect plan for each and every one of us. For us to be able to fully experience everything God has planned for us we need to be willing to move on from where we are now, to where God wants us to be. Instead of living in the past, we need to live in the now, with an eager expectation of what God will do in each of our lives now and in this coming year. If we want to be obedient disciples of Jesus then we must choose to allow God to work in our lives, to work in us and through us, to change and transform us. To take us from where we were, where we are to where God wants us to be. As Christians we are not called to be comfortable where we are, we are called to step out in faith. If we continue to cling on to things that should have been left far in our past, we will never fully discover or experience everything we are supposed to discover. God has created us, you and me with freedom of choice. Are you willing this year to choose to give God sovereign control of your life? Are you willing to choose to commit to discovering your destiny? God's desires and expects each of us, His followers, His children, to seek to live our lives according to His will and purpose. Sometimes we can make really good decisions and sometimes we can make the worst possible choice. From the outset, it is my hope that this year we will choose to do that which will bring honour and glory to God. That we will choose to place God's will and purposes above our own preferences. That we will choose to be obedient to His commands and precepts. The Bible, God's Word, is more than just some good guidelines on how we are meant to live as His followers. As Christians, we believe God continues to speak to us today through the Bible, His Word. God's Word is meant to be the final authority in every aspect of our lives. The Bible clearly shows us the life God wants us to live, and also where we fall short. If we are honest with ourselves, and with God, each of us know there have been times in our past when we chose our way over God's way, times when we took the easy option rather than the right option, times when instead of standing firm and striving for what God expected and desired of us, we fell short. This year, let's be different. Let's choose to allow the Holy Spirit to work in our lives each day to change and transform us."
Philippians 4:14-19,"('Grace', 'Generosity', 'Abundant Blessing')",Baptist," Blessed together in Christ Philippians 4: 14-19 Drawing near the conclusion of his letter, Paul once again offered a word of gratitude for the church in Philippi. They had certainly benefited greatly from the love and devotion of Paul, and yet he knew his commitment to them had not been without consequence. The church loved Paul, and they were committed to him as well. This had not been a one-sided affair, where one was expected to give without receiving anything in return. They all had benefited from their relationship and fondness for one another. Again we find a beautiful picture of how the New Testament church should look. As we come together, united by faith in Christ, we share and receive with one another. We all benefit from our fellowship in the Gospel. As we stand united in faith, individual needs are met, and the body is strengthened. Such unity of purpose and strength offers blessing to all. As we consider the blessings Paul mentioned in the text, I want to preach on the thought: Blessed together in Christ. I. Paul spoke of Faithfulness (14-16) - In these verses, Paul spoke of the faithfulness of the Philippian church. Consider: A. Their Generosity (14) - Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction. Paul had just spoken of the difficulties he faced in ministry, and his learning to be content regardless of the situation. Desiring to ensure his gratitude for their faithfulness, Paul commended their generosity. They had sought to assist Paul in his adversity, contributing to his need. While some sought his hurt, and others neglected him, Paul rejoiced that Philippi had proven a faithful partner in ministry; they had done well. I am certain Paul received monetary contributions that were a blessing to him, but he likely thought of their prayers and spiritual support as well. Many tend to believe the church is only interested in financial contributions from its members. While those are necessary to maintain our ministries, they are not the only contributions needed today. I am thankful for the opportunity to give of what the Lord has blessed me with, but I am also aware of the need for spiritual contributions as well. Every believer is gifted of the Lord and provided an opportunity to invest their gifts in the lives of others. B. Their Accountability (15) - Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. Paul reminded them of their faithfulness during the beginning stages of his ministry, even when others refused to contribute to his need. Philippi knew they stood alone in supporting Paul at times, and yet they continued, regardless of what others gave or withheld. They refused to allow the actions of others to dictate their giving and commitment to Paul. They knew his labor was worthy of their support, and they felt accountable to support him, even if others did not. We live in a day of decreasing support for missions and interest in the Gospel altogether. Many churches who once were very supportive of the Gospel have decreased, or even suspended their support. We will not be accountable for what others do, but we remain accountable for our actions. I pray we will continue to support the work of the Lord, even if others choose to abandon their efforts."
"Isaiah 45:2-3, Isaiah 46:9-10, Joel 2:28-29","('Worship', ""God's Power"", 'Shrine', 'Conviction Of Sin', 'Established', ""God's Pleasure"", 'Worshipping', 'All Mankind')",Salvation Army," Conviction and salvation for all mankind! One of this month's readings is from Isaiah 45:2-3. New International Version (NIV) 2 I will go before you and will level the mountains; I will break down gates of bronze and cut through bars of iron. 3 I will give you hidden treasures, riches stored in secret places, so that you may know that I am the LORD, the God of Israel, who summons you by name. This was part of a prophecy to Cyrus who was anointed by God to subdue nations. ""Cyrus the Great (559-530 B.C.E.), whom Isaiah 45 calls Yahweh's anointed, was the Persian king of Fars, a southern province of present-day Iran. By 546 he had defeated the wealthy king Croesus of Lydia (in modern Turkey), and the Lydian capital of Sardis fell to him along with all the other cities of Asia Minor. Cyrus then turned his attention to the most powerful kingdom in Central Asia: Babylon. By the end of 539, he had taken Babylon and captured its king, Nabonidus. The Persian Empire founded by Cyrus extended from the Aegean to Central Asia."" (https://www.bibleodyssey.org/en/people/related-articles/cyrus-the-messiah.aspx) Cyrus the Great was a Persian King, a gentile whom God at this time established to be the saviour of his people; Isaiah refers to him as God's anointed, this can also be interpreted as Messiah. God had great things for King Cyrus to do. While I am a foreigner here, I notice we are living in a very religious nation but a nation of people who do not know God, people who worship many gods, worship a philosopher, others who worship natural things, in the north near Kilinochchi I have even found a shrine where an unusually shaped rock is worshipped. As I sat here in prayers yesterday, I read the words behind me that state that we should establish a Salvation Army barracks on every corner. I have thought about this and my view is that this is a possibility! As I have travelled around the Island I have seen a shrine of some kind on nearly every corner, so why not a barracks? Right now you are probably thinking that The Property Secretary has gone mad and where would the funding come from, may be his furlough was not long enough? But listen to these words from Isaiah 46:9 and 10. ""Remember the former things long past, For I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is no one like Me, Declaring the end from the beginning, And from ancient times things which have not been done, Saying, My purpose will be established, And I will accomplish all My good pleasure."" I firmly believe that God is a God of awesome power and grace and mercy, in fact the only God who truly is. While we are established in thinking things cannot happen, or do not look to God for his leading, God will rise up another force to do his work, to be directed for his good pleasure. I believe that salvation for his people and his people is his purpose and all people's salvation is what brings him pleasure. The barracks that are to be established are through the infilling of The Holy Spirit not physical buildings. I am often reminded of God's words through the prophet Joel."

"Romans 1:20-32, Romans 12:14-18","('Persecution', 'Weird', 'The World', 'Exiles')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Living as Exiles - Embracing our Weirdness TCF Sermon January 3, 2016 Does anybody really make New Year's resolutions anymore? It can be a helpful exercise, but for many of us, they just end up being a to-do list for the next week or two, that quickly falls by the wayside in the face of everyday life. Or some of us are like this cat, and we give ourselves options with our New Year's resolutions: Option A: Lose some weight Option B: buy a bigger basket Or we fail to make challenging resolutions and make our resolutions too easily achievable: Such as this one: eat more cake, watch more TV Others of us are like this rooster, who's illustrates how Joel Vesanen thinks: ""No matter how badly life treated you last year, just walk tall with your head held high...this is a brand new year baby."" For a long time, I didn't understand why people would stand with hundreds of thousands of other people in Times Square on New Year's Eve just to see one year turn into the next. But I think the desire, and for some the need, to celebrate a New Year is inherent in us as human beings. Whether we're believers in Christ or not, I think we understand innately that life is often made up of fresh starts and new beginnings. In Christ, of course, we understand this in a deeper way. His mercies are new every morning. We have the gift of repentance and renewal that we can access day by day in Christ. There is redemption from our past. If we look back at 2015, and begin to think about these things on the first Sunday of 2016, I think most of us will agree that it was a particularly challenging year for us as believers in our culture. In many significant ways, 2016 dawned as a new world for us. In 2015, we saw thousands of years of a mostly common understanding of what marriage is, and what it means, completely redefined. We're now seeing that what it means to be a male and a female is also being completely redefined, based solely on what a person thinks and feels, exclusive of biological reality. We saw exposed the evil practice, of unborn babies' body parts being sold, and not only did our nation respond with mostly a collective yawn, but many responded by defending this barbarism. And the cultural change seemed to happen so fast. What's more, we're seeing hints of things to come for the church. Tell me if you don't see our Western culture in these words from Paul to the Romans: Romans 1:20-32 (NIV) 20 For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse. 21 For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles. 24 Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25 They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is forever praised. Amen. 26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. 27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. 28 Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. 29 They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, 30 slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; 31 they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless. 32 Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them."
Matthew 5:1-12,"('Beatitudes', 'Christian Virtues', ""Jesus' S Vision"", 'Vocabulary')",*other," Matthew 5:1-12 Title: New Kingdom Order - The Beatitudes Proposition: Jesus begins to share with us His New Kingdom Order. By following Jesus we will experience a transformation of our 1. Vocabulary 2. Our Vision 3. Our Values/ Virtues. Our lives will emulate the way things are in God's Kingdom. INTRO: Grace and peace from God our Father and from His Son Jesus Christ who came to take away the sin of the world. In the first four chapters of his Gospel, St. Matthew shares with us some amazing stories concerning our Lord Jesus Christ. In chapters one and two Matthew shares with us Jesus' genealogy, some stories surrounding his birth and early life. In chapter three Matthew introduces us to John the Baptist and subsequently the baptism of Jesus. In chapter four Matthew shares with us Jesus' temptation in the wilderness, the early days of his ministry and all its successes. He tells us in Matthew 4:24 - 25: ""So his (Jesus) fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought him all the sick, those afflicted with various diseases and pains, those oppressed by demons, epileptics, and paralytics, and he healed them. And great crowds followed him from Galilee and the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan."" What we are to understand then is that Jesus and his disciples were actively preaching the Good News, healing the sick and delivering people from bondage. Jesus was transforming lives and bringing about the Kingdom of Heaven here on earth. In just a few chapters Matthew has provided us a great deal of material to meditate and digest. But then we begin to read chapters five through seven and find ourselves immersed in what has been called the greatest sermon of all time. We find ourselves sitting on the mountainside listening to Jesus give us this amazing sermon which over the years has been called ""The Magna Charta of Christianity"", ""The Manifesto of the King"", ""Life Under the Reign of God"" and ""The Law of Christian Society. As you read it, I think you have to agree what Matthew shares with us here in these three chapters has to be considered a part of his greatest gift to the Church. No other Gospel writer shares with us in such a concise way so many of Jesus' essential truths and teachings. If you really want to know what the Christian life is all about then read I would encourage you to read, meditate and study these three chapters. However, don't attempt to do it all in one setting. Or at least don't try to just read them and think that you have absorb it all. Anyone who has taken the time to read all three chapters in one setting knows what I mean. There is more material in these 111 verses than you can absorb in one setting. or even a few settings. What Jesus teaches and preaches here is enough material to last us a lifetime. It has long been known that the sermon that Matthew shares with us here is actually a compilation of a great many of Jesus' sermons put together in one setting. That is to say that Matthew has collected the main themes of many of Jesus' sermons and complies them into the sermon that we see here in chapters five through seven. It doesn't mean that Jesus did not share all that we have written here but instead of them happening all at once they are pieces of different sermons that have been put together in one long sermon."
Galatians 5:6,"('Faith', 'Service', 'Love')",Christian/Church Of Christ," The 3 C's of a Healthy Church - The Love Connection Galatians 5:6 (p. 812) January 22, 2017 Introduction: So your boss walks into your office and you say, ""Hi Boss."" And He says, ""Hey."" But then he says, ""Listen I stopped in this morning because I want you to focus on one thing today...seriously, one focus on one thing today...seriously, one thing...I need that Simon's plan completed...I need all the numbers...I need the strategy worked out...It's the only thing that really counts today...got it."" And you understand just how important it is to him and you respond...""Got it!"" After he walks out you grab the Simon's file, but the phone rings, so you answer it...after you get off the phone you decide you've got time to answer some emails and go talk with some members of your team....that lasts a while so you head to lunch with them...after you get back you look at the file, but get distracted by a game of solitaire...and then organize your desk. When your Boss stops back in at 3:00 he wants what he asked for, but it's not done...not even close...How happy is He going to be...you're probably going to hear...""Man...it's the one thing I needed from you...didn't you understand it's the only thing that counts today."" He might not fire you but he's not going to trust you with a big project again anytime soon....and he might fire you! When the Apostle Paul writes: ""The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love"" to the Galatians and to us He wants us to understand what's most important...He wants us to understand that this is the first priority of our faith. Because it's really easy: I. TO START DOING STUFF AND FORGET ABOUT LOVING PEOPLE The book of Galatians has been called the ""mini book of Romans"" because both deal with the issues of faith, grace and the Law. Paul visited the Galatians on all three of his missionary journeys...and initially the Galatians received him warmly...they were very open to the gospel message...but then later some individuals began to question his leadership as well as prevent the gospel by saying, ""You must obey all the traditions of the Jewish Law as well as accept Jesus by faith."" They especially required that ""circumcision"" was essential. Paul's answer ""neither circumcision or uncircumcision means anything: what counts is the new creation."" (Gal. 6:15) Let me share passionately that God's church needs servants...The harvest is plentiful but the workers...are few."" Without you fulfilling your calling and gift there will always be gaps...usually those gaps have to be, filled by people who are already serving in many areas, but don't want the church to suffer...They end up doing too much and burn out...they also deal with the frustration of seeing people constantly sitting on the sidelines."
"Romans 12:2, Titus 3:5","('Worldview', 'Renewing The Mind')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Mushy Minds TCF Sermon March 6, 2016 ---------------------------------- NOTE: the powerpoint for this sermon, which includes a video and visuals illustrating the message, is freely available at this link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/92pdz6wzg7liu32/Mushy%20Minds%20-%20TCF%20sermon%20presentation.pptx?dl=0 The asterisks are change cues for the powerpoint points. I've been thinking quite a bit lately about why people think the way they think. In other words, I've been thinking about our thinking. How, for example, can two people look at this shirt I'm wearing, and one person think it's red, which is clearly the case, and another think it's purple, or for that matter blue or white? We're looking at the same thing and see two completely different things. In the case of my shirt, it could be a simple matter of color-blindness - a physical condition. But especially in light of the current state of politics - and don't worry, this message will have very little to do with that - we have enough division in the nation without bringing it into the church - I've thought a lot about how people are able to hear what they want to hear, regardless of the facts, or in reality, regardless of the truth. This is not a case of what's right for me is right for me and what's right for you is right for you. That may be OK when it comes to your favorite food or your favorite color or your favorite sport or your preferred vacation destination. # It's not a truth that the Rocky Mountains are the best place to go for a vacation. That's my preference, but you may prefer the beach, or the Appalachians, or even a big city where there are a lot of things you can do. But it's not an incontrovertible truth that the Rockies are the best place to visit on vacation. That's a very individual choice. But with many other things, and that includes all of the most important things, as scripture defines important, what's truth is truth. There's no in-between. There's a right way to see things and a wrong way to see things. Paul implied exactly that with Timothy (in 2 Tim 2:15) # when he encouraged him to ""rightly handle the word of truth."" Doesn't the fact that Paul instructed Timothy to rightly handle the word of truth clearly imply that if you can handle the word correctly, you can also wrongly, or incorrectly handle the word of truth? And there we come down to the theme of this morning's message, titled Mushy Minds. Consider this commercial from about 6 years ago, and note how it humorously makes one of the points we're getting at today. But it's almost a Screwtape letters kind of tactic - mocking the very truth it illustrates. One worldview writer called this ""shamelessly direct."" # Play Hulu video clip (embedded clip available in this sermon's accompanying powerpoint - see link above) Of course, mushy is what we want to avoid - and not just so our brains are not made tastier for alien consumption. One definition of mushy is soft, which does relate to our theme today. But the 2nd definition is more related to our look at the mind this morning."
Joel 2:1-11,"('Hell', 'Judgement', 'Judgment', 'Justice Of God')",Assembly Of God," The Day Of The Lord Text: Joel 2:1-11 Introduction 1. Illustration: God has done everything He possibly can to keep you out of Hell and still leave you as a person with free will. Now some Christians argue otherwise that it is in fact God who sends people to hell. Peculiar Pilgrim blog writes, ""No one would choose to go into hell ... Not one person would decide to enter an eternity of flaming torment over an eternity in heavenly bliss ... The Lord Jesus Christ, who will sit upon the throne of his glory (Matt 25:31-46) will judge the hearts and minds of every living person. Jesus will say to many on that day, ""I never knew you. Depart from me you workers of lawlessness."" (Mat 7:23) And thus, he blames God for sending us to hell. But when a criminal is sent to jail, we don't blame the judge, do we? We blame the criminal. The judge isn't responsible because he's just following the law, in fact, his hands or decisions are bound or tied by the law. It was the criminal who broke the law and that's why they were sent to jail. Likewise, God is bound by who he is, a holy, loving, righteous and just God and by His decision to give us free will and then not violate it by keeping us from making bad decisions. So it's not God who sends us to hell but our decisions and the repercussions that we must live with. 2. In the roughly 20 years that I have been preaching I never considered myself a ""hell, fire, and brimstone"" type of preacher. I prefer to focus on God's love, grace and mercy. However, we must recognize that God is a righteous and just God as well. How can God be righteous and just and not judge people for their actions? 3. How can we share God's truth and not share the whole truth? Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying we should chase after people waiving our Bibles in the air and shouting, ""You're on your way to hell!"" Yet there are some people that need to hear that hell is real and it is eternal! 4. We need to warn people that... A. About the consequences B. That Hell Is Real C. God is Righteous And Just 5. Let's stand together as we read Joel 2:1-11. Proposition: We need to warn people that a life of sin leads to an eternity in hell. Transition: We need to... I. Warn People About The Consequences (1-2). A. Sound The Alarm 1. Sometimes in life we have to do things that make us uncomfortable. Like telling someone they can have that last piece of pizza when it's calling your name. Or telling a Michigan fan you like their blue shirt! 2. Well sometimes we have to confront people with their sin and the consequences it brings. Sometimes we just have to do things that make us uncomfortable. 3. So Joel begins this chapter with, ""Sound the alarm in Jerusalem! Raise the battle cry on my holy mountain! Let everyone tremble in fear because the day of the LORD is upon us."" A. The signaling alarm or ""trumpet"" (sôpar) made from a ram's horn is to be blown, as it is in war, heralding an attack, or on other occasions announcing news of great import. B. Shôphar denotes a ""horn,"" likely a ram's horn, which is hollowed for blowing. It was not used as a musical instrument but rather served a number of functions centering upon summoning. The Day of Yahweh, a period of judgment and vindication of Yahweh over his enemies, is announced by the shôphar (The Complete Biblical Library Hebrew-English Dictionary - Sin-Taw, Under: ""8223"")."
Joel 2:12-17,"('Worship', 'Heart')",Assembly Of God," Open Heart Surgery Text: Joel 2:12-17 Introduction 1. Illustration: ""Tomorrow morning I'll open up your heart"" the surgeon said to the 8 year-old-boy. ""You'll find Jesus there,"" the boy said. The surgeon continued, ""I'll open your heart and check the damage."" ""You'll find Jesus there,"" the boy said. ""When I see the damage, I will suture you back up and then think about the next step,"" said the surgeon. ""You will find Jesus in my heart because my Sunday school teacher told me so. She said it says so in the Bible. Besides that, our Sunday school songs say He lives there,"" said the boy. The surgery took place the next day. After the surgery the surgeon began to make notes of what he found. In his mind there was no hope and no cure. The little boy would die within a matter of months. The thought began to get to the doctor and all of a sudden the doctor shouted to God, ""Why did you do this to the boy? Why can't he live a normal life?"" God spoke to the surgeon's heart and said, ""The boy is a part of my flock and will always be a part of my flock. When he is with me there will be no more suffering and pain. He will have comfort and peace. One day his parents as well as you will join him and my flock will continue to grow."" The next day the surgeon went to the boy's room and sat down with the parents beside the bed. In a moment or two, the boy opened his eyes and asked very quietly, ""What did you find in my heart?"" With tears flowing down his cheeks, the surgeon said, ""I found Jesus there."" 2. If they were to open up your heart today what would they find? Would they find Jesus there? 3. To allow Jesus to operate on our hearts requires that we... A. Let God Have All Of You B. Let God Have Your Worship 4. Let's stand together as we read Joel 2:12-17. Proposition: We will never be all that God has for us until we give our entire selves to God. Transition: First we have to... I. Let God Have All Of You (12-14). A. Give Me Your Hearts 1. Previously, Joel had called the people to blow the alarm that judgment was coming. He took their hope and shattered it. Now he turns their despair back into hope if they will repent and turn back to God. 2. He begins in v. 12 with, ""That is why the LORD says, ""Turn to me now, while there is time. Give me your hearts. Come with fasting, weeping, and mourning."" A. The appropriate response to the devastation brought by God is repentance. B. Triple transition indicators mark it. ""While"" and ""now"" indicate a new, sequential element to what precedes it. C. It allows a brief window of opportunity to respond in the face of the rapidly approaching Day of Yahweh. D. The direct discourse indicator (""That is why the LORD SAYS"") identifies the exhortation to repent as originating from Yahweh himself. E. Yahweh does not wait for the people to turn to him; he initiates the discussion. F. The new word directed to the audience is an imperative, ""turn/repent"", which forms a repetition of a related word (return) in Joel 2:13b. G. Joel follows this up with the manner of repentance: It must be total, accompanied not only by the traditional outward signs of grief, but also with a true, inner reflection of sorrow (""with all your heart"") (Baker, The NIV Application Commentary - Joel, Obadiah, Malachi: From biblical text...to contemporary life, 65)."
Isaiah 9:1-4,"('Safety', 'Clarity', 'Spiritual Light')",Anglican," Have you ever stumbled around in the dark-either at night or during a power outage? It's not a very pleasant experience, is it? Darkness is associated with a number of unpleasant things. When we are in the dark, we tend to move slowly or wander aimlessly. We tend to be scared in the dark, mainly because we can't see the dangers that would be apparent if it were light. There is something about darkness that makes us scared. We can also wander around in spiritual darkness. That darkness is caused by our lack of knowledge in or faith in Jesus. When we receive the Light of Christ, we don't have to be afraid of darkness or evil. Christ will be with us. When we are faithful, we will be rewarded. The prophet Isaiah wrote the passage we heard earlier in this morning's service during a time of spiritual darkness. Israel was at war with Assyria and was on the verge of being conquered because of their disobedience to God. Throw in a crop failure, no welfare system, an economy that relied solely on agriculture, no technology to preserve food and no system to distribute the food and the result is a very bleak situation. For Isaiah, the answer to this crisis was God's ability to intervene at a moment in history and accomplish his purpose for his people. Isaiah emphasized peace and the end of war-a plan that was appealing to a nation that had been eroded by warfare and strife. Isaiah's vision for the people was to live in a world where God's light would penetrate the darkness of sin. Isaiah's vision happened because of his faithfulness. God showed him the revelation of the future and the Messiah who was to be born. The Messiah would conquer death and would be the great light of hope that would shine on all of humanity. He will make His people more abundant, increase their joy and break the rods of their oppressors. In the Bible, darkness points to both known ignorance and willful blindness. People are either lacking knowledge about God or they reject him or both. The seasons of Christmas and Epiphany point to the glory of God as revealed in Jesus' birth in that humble Bethlehem manger. His birth was the dividing line between the age of darkness and the age of light. Our world is full of darkness and sin. Our leaders sometimes make decisions that don't make sense to us as Christians. They don't trust God. We must not allow despair to overwhelm us. We are to live in the light of God's presence. He is the deliverer, the ultimate agent at work in the world. Isaiah speaks of the area of Galilee in the northern kingdom of Israel experiencing humiliation at the hands of the Assyrians. However, a time would come when a great light of salvation through the messianic King would dispel the dark gloom of judgment. When Jesus began his ministry in Galilee, the fulfillment of this prophecy was set in motion. Isaiah compares this King's victory over Israel's enemies to the day of Midian, when Gideon and his outnumbered Israelite army defeated the Midianites through God's powerful intervention."

"Philippians 3:12-21, Philippians 3:12-21","('Obedience', 'Fresh Start', 'Trust God')",Baptist," INTRODUCTION: ""Forget the past and start anew!"" How many times have you heard this phrase in your life? Maybe you heard it a countless times already. Is this the same with what Apostle Paul said to the Philippians? Let us study how... 12 Not that I have already attained this - that is, I have not already been perfected - but I strive to lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus also laid hold of me. 13 Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself to have attained this. Instead I am single-minded: Forgetting the things that are behind and reaching out for the things that are ahead, I. Leave Yesterday Behind, 12-13 A. Admit imperfection, 12 B. Account shortcomings, 13 C. Amend for the future, 13 Symbol/Ceremony : Burn-offering 14 with this goal in mind, I strive toward the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. 15 Therefore let those of us who are ""perfect"" embrace this point of view. If you think otherwise, God will reveal to you the error of your ways. 16 Nevertheless, let us live up to the standard that we have already attained. II. Live Today Looking Forward, 14-16 A. Regard Jesus' purpose, 12 B. Response to God's call, 14 C. Remain in God's standard, 16 Symbol/Ceremony: Laying of Memorial Stones (Vision and Goals) 17 Be imitators of me, brothers and sisters, and watch carefully those who are living this way, just as you have us as an example. 18 For many live, about whom I have often told you, and now, with tears, I tell you that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ. 19 Their end is destruction, their god is the belly, they exult in their shame, and they think about earthly things. 20 But our citizenship is in heaven - and we also await a savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, 21 who will transform these humble bodies of ours into the likeness of his glorious body by means of that power by which he is able to subject all things to himself. III. Lead a Transformed Lives A. Remember the Models of Faith, 17-18 B. Remember the Citizenship, 20 C. Remember the Return of Christ, 21 Symbol/Ceremony: Candle Lighting CONCLUSION: Forgetting the past is cannot be done without analyzing what were right and wrong. Mistakes can be a great teacher. It helps you to become better by not doing it again. Keeping and improving the right things you did in the past leads you to greatness. After making amends with God, it is time to start a transformed life in Christ. Remember, God is with us! We start with God because vision begins with God. Let's start the new year with anew life. Let us operate by trusting the Lord and obeying His word. Let us keep our ourselves in the presence of Lord! Live for Jesus!"

Over the years a great number of Churches in the United States are steadily declining. Our churches are becoming a thing of the past. Not buildings, programs or size.

Gives all praise to the Lord. 4. Full of Love for one another. David gives us examples of how to praise our Lord. (1) Psalm 100: 1 (A Psalm of praise.)

"Jonah 1:1, Jonah 2:1","('Jonah', 'Will Of God', 'Listening To God')",Baptist," There is much to be said and much to be learned about a preacher named Jonah. God had a message to send the people of Ninevah and the mouthpiece He chose to use decided to go a different way. How many times in my life I have chose to go the wrong direction when God spoke. In the first chapter and the third verse we see that Jonah paid the fare of the ship going to Tarahish and went down into it. Jonah paid his own money to go against the will of the Lord, but this wouldn't be the last wage Jonah pays for his sin. A snowball effect of destruction started upon Jonah as he chose not to listen to what God would have him do. The next thing we see is that the ship has set its course with Jonah in the ships belly. All of a sudden here comes the storm, all brought on by one man's disobedience. Here is a good place to interject and reaffirm that the discisions you make can and will effect others. As the mighty temptest rose and the winds blew contrary to the ship we get to see who the men of the ship call upon in their time of trouble. With the use of the words their gods lower case g we can see that they don't call upon the one true living God. This reminds me of a man named Elijah who stood atop of mount Carmel facing off against the prophets of Baal. In both instances we see a people calling out on a god that fails, and never can or will deliver anything even themselves. But back to Jonah the ship master finds Jonah asleep in the belly of the ship and asks him what meanest thou O sleeper? Knowing that destruction was imminent the ship master (be it last ditch effort, time of desperation, or what have you) he tells Jonah to call upon his God or else they will all perish. Sadly enough sometimes even we as God's people, instead of calling on God first look to Him as a last ditch effort. I will glory God now and say thank God for grace and mercy!!! Jonah is woken up with a huge storm around and panic from the people. Jonah knew he had placed innocent people in harms way, simply by disobedience to the God of Heaven. The men in their desperation ask Jonah what is his occupation, of what people is he, and so on. Jonah gives an answer and that answer is ""And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.""?Jonah? ?1:9? ?KJV??. Now this next part of the story is heartbreaking as a child of God and I will tell you why after the reading of the next verse. ""Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord, because he had told them."" ??Jonah? ?1:10? ?KJV?? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord...... Men that didn't serve Jonah's God, witnessed Jonah running from the will of God. Knowing that the Hebrew were the children of God these ship stewards witnessed a child of God refusing to do what God wanted him to do. The next few verses we witness these men did everything in their power not to cast Jonah over, but ultimately this had to happen to spare the ship and them that were upon it. Fear fell upon the men of the ship and they offered vows and a sacrifice unto the true God once the storm around them became peaceful waters. God can definitely take a negative and use it as a positive to impact His kingdom. I'm reminded here of what God told Jeremiah behold I am the Lord, God of all flesh is there anything to hard for me? Of course there isn't anything to hard for the One who created it all... Jonah was a witness to those mean in one way or another and we know it was a negative witness, yet God still got glory. As the chapter finishes up we find this verse"
Revelation 8:10-11,"('Book Of Revelation', 'Third Angle', 'Wormwood')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 3-27-2016 Title: Third Trumpet: Third of Rivers and Springs Become Bitter, Many Die (Revelation 8:10-11) Revelation 8:10-11 (KJV) 10 And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; 11 And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter. Introduction At the blowing of the third trumpet, a star with the name Wornwood falls from the sky and lands on a third of the rivers and springs, making a third of the water toxic. The plant with the same name as the star, Wormwood, is a bitter plant often used as a metaphor for something bitter to the taste, though it is not usually considered a poison. The blowing of trumpets called the Israelites together for instruction (Numbers 10:3) or for marching (Numbers 10:3-7); it summoned them to assemble for war (Jeremiah 4:19; 42:14, etc.), and to return from dispersion (Isaiah 27:13); it announced release in the year of jubilee (Leviticus 25:8-10), and here it announces judgment. The trumpet judgments are quite similar to the plagues which God sent upon Egypt at the time of the deliverance of Israel, though they do not occur in the same order. After the Exodus, Israel encountered bitter waters at Marah (which means ""bitter"") and Moses had to purify the water supply (Exodus 15: 23-27). But no supernatural purification will be available during the Tribulation. Commentary ""And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven."" This occurred when a great flaming star fell out of the sky. Some Bible commentators believe that this may be a comet. If this is taken literally, a third ecological disaster is depicted. The trees, the grass, the sea have all been devastated; now the rivers and fountains of waters are spoiled. But a disaster affecting the water supply of mankind hardly seems a sufficient explanation of what happens under this trumpet. The events described must probably be taken symbolically, even though interpreters have varied widely in seeking to identify the fallen star. Simon Magus; Attila, ""the scourge of God;"" Muhammad; and even the Jewish historian Josephus have been suggested. Some have identified the fallen star with the AntiChrist. Others identify the star as Satan. Since the star that falls at the sounding of the fifth trumpet (9:1) is an angelic being, it is possible that Wormwood is also an angel. But no star or fallen angel named Wormwood can be found in any other source. The clue to the interpretation is in Revelation 12:12, where we read, ""Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time."" The earlier part of the chapter tells how, in his original fall, the devil, the great red dragon, cast a third part of the stars (i.e., his angels) out of heaven. With Satan's fall from heaven, recorded incidentally in Revelation 13, a new woe is to be added to the horrors taking place on earth. Michael warns mankind that Satan's expulsion from heaven causes woe on earth. It is significant that the last three trumpets are specifically called ""woe"" trumpets. Revelation 13 lends strong support to the view that the fallen star is Satan himself. He is given the symbolic name of Wormwood, and he poisons the third part of ""the waters,"" which become bitter and result in the death of many men. The symbolism of the waters is explained in Revelation 17:15: ""the waters . . . are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues."" In other words, Satan's fall to earth results in the immediate poisoning of human life and society. The peoples of the earth take on the character of the evil one and become ""wormwood"" too. Satan is bitter because he has been cast out of heaven. Men become bitter, and many people die."
"Judges 1:1-2:5, Judges 1:1-2:5","('Sin', 'Israel', 'Obedience', 'Covenant Broken')",Baptist," Church At The Gates: Missoula, MT Church Judges 1-2:5 | Week 1 | Finish the Job The Lists in our Lives You have a list. Everyone has a list. Maybe it's a ""honey-do"" list or a list of assignments from Professor No-Fun or a list of New Year's Resolutions you've just barely started or you're almost done abandoning. Either way, you have a list. This list, in some sense, guides your day to day life. You know, too, that if the list isn't completed in the manner expected, credit won't be given and you'll suffer the exasperated sigh and gaze of a disappointed spouse, a lower grade on your assignments, the loss of a job promotion, or any number of other things. We know this truth intrinsically: Incomplete Obedience Has Consequences You Had One Job The Israelites had left Egypt. They had wandered in the dessert while an unbelieving generation died off. They stood on the dry river bed of the Jordan River as the Lord held back the rushing torrent. They fought the battle of Jericho and the walls came a tumblin' down. They continued the conquest of the promised land. Their one job? Destroy the Canaanite presence in the promised land. Down to the last living thing. (Dt. 20:16-28Open in Logos Bible Software (if available)) Under Joshua, they secure a large portion of the promised land but fail to conquer the land and the people completely. Joshua, nearing the end of his life, understanding that finishing the job will fall to the next generation offers this charge to the people of Israel: ""14 Now therefore fear the Lord and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness. Put away the gods that your fathers served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the Lord. 15 And if it is evil in your eyes to serve the Lord, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your fathers served in the region beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."" Joshua 24:14-15Open in Logos Bible Software (if available) The people reply enthusiastically: ""16 Then the people answered, ""Far be it from us that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods, 17 for it is the Lord our God who brought us and our fathers up from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, and who did those great signs in our sight and preserved us in all the way that we went, and among all the peoples through whom we passed. 18 And the Lord drove out before us all the peoples, the Amorites who lived in the land. Therefore we also will serve the Lord, for he is our God."" Joshua 24:16-18Open in Logos Bible Software (if available) This is good news. In fact, for a man facing his own mortality, wondering what his legacy will be, wondering if the stubborn, stiff-necked people will devote themselves to the Lord -- their declaration is great news. It is a promise that can comfort an old man about an unknown future. This is where the book of Judges really begins: with the good news of Chapter 24. Judges is a sequel of sorts to the book of Joshua. As readers, we're meant to enter the first words of Judges with a cautious optimism."
Matthew 9:1-7,"('Forgive Sins', ""Jesus' Compassion"", 'Shows Compassion')",Baptist," Introduction A. The students in my third-grade class were bombarding me with questions about my newly pierced ears. ""Does the hole go all the way through?"" ""Yes."" ""Did it hurt?"" ""Just a little."" ""Did they stick a needle through your ears?"" ""No, they used a special gun."" Silence followed, and then one solemn voice called out, ""How far away did they stand?"" B. We continue our walk through Matthew 1. Today, Matthew 9:1-8 II. Body A. Joni Earekson Tada 1. Not too long ago we were watching the John Ancherburg Show with Joni, she is a beautiful Christian woman who was paralyzed from the neck down after a diving incident. a. Though she does have some control of her arms 2. Here in Matthew 9:1, after being kicked out of the country of the Gadarenes because allowed demons to destroy their pig industry, Jesus returns to Capernaum a. By the way, notice Jesus complied with their wishes b. I remember one individual saying that God is a gentleman and will not force Himself on anyone. (1) Whether this is so or not I cannot tell you (a) But just take note (2) The local citizens asked Jesus to leave, so He did, He left (3) What an opportunity lost (4) When people reject Christ, He complies with their wishes and leaves (a) As I said, Jesus won't force Himself on anyone (b) He won't force Himself on you i) Just think, the town's people were paralyzed by their heart attitude toward Christ B. Now if you will remember, before Jesus and the disciples left in the boat, there was a large crowd 1. But, by the time He returned to the other side of the lake, the previous crowd has disbursed, but several days later, according to Mark 2:1&2, they hear He is back in town and come from everywhere to hear Him speak. Mark 2:1-2 NKJV And again He entered Capernaum after some days, and it was heard that He was in the house. {2} Immediately many gathered together, so that there was no longer room to receive them, not even near the door. And He preached the word to them. 2. Now this is where Jesus heals the paralyzed man a. We have read Matthew 9:1-7, but lets read it again Matthew 9:1-7 NKJV So He got into a boat, crossed over, and came to His own city. {2} Then behold, they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, ""Son, be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven you."" {3} And at once some of the scribes said within themselves, ""This Man blasphemes!"" {4} But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, ""Why do you think evil in your hearts? {5} ""For which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, 'Arise and walk'? {6} ""But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins""; then He said to the paralytic, ""Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house."" {7} And he arose and departed to his house. b.

And He preached the word to them. {3} Then they came to Him, bringing a paralytic who was carried by four men. {4} And when they could not come near Him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where He was. So when they had broken through, they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying. {5} When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, ""Son, your sins are forgiven you."" {6} And some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, {7} ""Why does this Man speak blasphemies like this? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"" {8} But immediately, when Jesus perceived in His spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves, He said to them, ""Why do you reason about these things in your hearts? {9} ""Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, 'Arise, take up your bed and walk'? {10} ""But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins""; He said to the paralytic, {11} ""I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go to your house."" {12} Immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went out in the presence of them all, so that all were amazed and glorified God, saying, ""We never saw anything like this!"""
Matthew 9:9-13,"('Disciples', 'Levi Matthew', 'Zacchaeus And Jesus', 'Matthew Old Friends')",Baptist," Introduction A. There is an old, old story about a pilgrim standing outside heaven, longing to enter in, watching as others were welcomed through the gates of pearl, onto the streets of gold. As he stood there, he saw a group clothed in white robes and waving banners approaching the gates. He turned to the gatekeeper and asked, ""Who are they?"" The gatekeeper answered, ""Those are the prophets who prepared the way for the Christ who told of His coming and of the great joy that would be experienced at His birth."" The man said, ""Well, I'm not a prophet, so I cannot enter with them."" Soon he saw another procession coming. It was a smaller group, but a glorious one nevertheless. They, too, were clothed in white robes. Again he asked, ""Who are they?"" ""Why, they're the apostles who walked with Jesus - Peter and James and John and Andrew and Bartholomew and all the others. They're the ones who preached the Gospel, and established the church."" The man said, ""Well, I'm not an apostle, so I cannot enter with them, either."" But as he continued to watch there came yet another procession much larger than the first two. They, too, were clothed in white and carrying banners of victory. Once again he asked, ""Who are they?"" ""Why,"" said the gatekeeper, ""Those are the missionaries and ministers who went into all the world with the gospel, inviting the lost and dying to come to Jesus."" The man bowed his head and said, ""I'm not one of them, either."" But then he heard the sound of many footsteps in the distance, and when he looked up he saw a vast throng of people, more than any could possibly number. And what a motley mixture they appeared to be. He didn't understand exactly how he knew, but these were obviously the rejects of the earth, the refuse of mankind, publicans and sinners and harlots. He thought to himself, ""Surely, the gates of heaven will not open for them."" But to his amazement the gates swung wide open - and he heard the heavenly choir singing songs of joyous welcome. Dumfounded, he asked, ""Who are they?"" The gatekeeper responded, ""These are those who have sinned greatly, but who have been forgiven and saved through the grace of Almighty God."" The man leaped for joy and said, ""I'm one of them. I can enter with them."" And he, too, walked through the gates of pearl and received the welcome of the heavenly choir. B. John Haddington of Scotland said, ""I have been comforted for more than 20 years by the thought that Jesus welcomes, not only sensible sinners, but stupid ones as well."" 1. Lets turn to Matthew 9:9 II. Body A. The call of Matthew Matthew 9:9 NKJV As Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, ""Follow Me."" So he arose and followed Him. 1. The old King James called Matthew a publican a. A publican was a Jew who worked for the Romans as a tax collector b. They were generally hated by the Jews for several reasons (1) They were collaborators with the Roman occupying force (2) Many were thieves"
Matthew 9:14-17,"('Jesus Teachings', 'Teachings Of Christ', 'Challenging', 'Never Boring')",Baptist," Introduction A. There are many literary forms used in the Bible. 1. There is poetry 2. Proverbs 3. Legal documents 4. Dramatic narratives 5. Hymns 6. Sermons 7. Theological treatise 8. Personal letters 9. And apocalyptic visions 10. And sprinkled into all of these forms are figures of speech and word pictures that highlight what is being said a. The form that a writer or speaker chooses to use in order to communicate his or her message indicates it's meaning or how it should be treated or interpreted 11. For example, Jesus could have given us a 1-hour lecture on who my neighbor is a. He could have bored us to death for hours on how to treat someone in need b. But instead of writing or presenting a theological thesis on this, Jesus simply told the story of the Good Samaritan c. It wasn't a lecture they needed; it was a story that had the potential of softening their hard-hearts (1) Jesus was the master storyteller (2) Jesus used stories or parables to connect with his listeners 12. Some of the parables were true stories taken from daily life a. They are told as fact in the present tense b. We understand seed growing (1) Yeast at work in dough (2) Children playing (3) Sheep grazing (4) And we all know what it's like to lose something (a) Jesus told true stories about these things (5) Some of the parables were story parables (a) These stories, which may or may not have actually happened (being real history is not important (b) These stories are meant to convey a significant truth i) Jesus made up some of these stories and used them as illustrations ii) Then there are example stories. They give us examples to either follow or avoid iii) They focus on the character and conduct of the individual. c. While these stories teach us many good and wholesome things (as we will learn together), the parables do two other things that are easily overlooked (1) First, the stories of Jesus indicate that He was fully acquainted with human life in its many experiences (2) He was knowledgeable in farming, sowing seeds, and reaping a harvest (3) Not only was he familiar with the workaday world of the farmer, the fisherman, the builder, and the merchant (a) But also he moved with equal ease among the managers of estates (b) The ministers of finance at a royal court (c) The judge in a court of law (d) The Pharisees (e) And the tax collectors (4) His stories portray the lives of men, women, and children, the poor and rich, the outcast and the exalted (5) He knew about work and wages, about weddings and festive occasions as well as funerals and sickness (6) See, Jesus used illustrations the common people understood (a) They were familiar truths He used in order to teach an unfamiliar or unrealized lesson 13. Second, Jesus' stories reveal His heart a. They tell His autobiography and the autobiography of God b. Do you want to know how God feels about people being a good neighbor, read the story of the Good Samaritan c. Do you want to know how God feels when someone who is lost finally finds home again? Read the story of the Prodigal Son"
Revelation 3:14-22,"('Lukewarm', 'Delusional', 'Sickening', 'Self Righteous')",Baptist," Revelation 3:14 - 22 I. Introduction A. The city of Laodicea was almost due East of Ephesus about 120 miles or so on a major trade route in Asia 1. The city was a banking center and so a very wealthy city a. The city was also the site of mineral springs which could only be tolerated if it was drank very hot or very cold otherwise it would cause nausea b. Another thing was that the city was the center of the manufacture of a salve for the eyes B. The name Laodicea comes from two Greek words 1. One means People 2. The other means to judge 3. So the meaning of the name of the city is the rule of the people or self rule C. Church age 1. I believe that the age of the church at Laodicea began after World War II a. Soldiers who fought in the East brought Eastern wives home (1) Japanese (2) Korean (3) Chinese (4) And other non-Christian women (5) This goes along with the error of Balaam - these young soldiers became unequally yoked with non-Christians who lead them away from the church b. This along with the advent of the great American Middle Class (1) GI Bill educations (2) GI Bill homes (3) An Abundance of well paying jobs c. All leading to the beginning of the general move away from the church d. And to self-indulgence (1) Which goes along very well with the name self-rule 2. J. Vernon Mc Gee believes that the church at Laodicea is the great religious prostitute of the tribulation period 3. Renald Showers in his article on Laodicea says that this church is made up of people who have been exposed to the gospel message; but do not have a personal relationship with Christ 4. But, the terminology does not allow for these two interpretations a. In the Greek the word for church is Ecclassia, literally called out ones. b. Christ would not have said, to the called out ones in Laodicea if they were not called out ones c. The great religious prostitute of the tribulation will deny the very name of Christ, His deity, His sovereignty, and His very person d. Those who may appear to be church members but have no relationship with Christ may fool you and me; but they would hardly fool the God of the universe 5. No I truly believe that the age of the Loadicean church is now!!! D. This is the last church and the last church age. As we examine this church we shall see 1. The Condemnation 2. The Warning 3. And the promise 4. Let's turn to Revelation 3:14 II. Body A. The preamble to Christ's message to the church at Laodicea also sheds some light on the character of the church's Lord and Master Revelation 3:14 To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the ruler of God's creation. And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God; 1. Christ calls Himself a. The Amen b. The faithful and the true witness c. The beginning of the creation of God 2. The Amen a. This is the only place in the Scriptures where Amen is a proper name (1) Several commentators call this an enigmatic use of the word"
Luke 1:26-45,"('Christmas', 'Miracle')",Nazarene," Jesus is your miracle Luke 1:26-1:45 Introduction- Prayer- This morning I want us to take a look at the miracle of Jesus birth. For you to fully understand, you have to look at the birth of Jesus as your own personal miracle. That a loving God would leave heaven and come to this earth in a miraculous way to show you that you mean the world to him. To doubt or question his birth is to doubt that He did it for you. It would make it a Sunday school story that will not change your life or the way that you live your life. Isaiah the prophet records- ""Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign; the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel."" Immanuel translated means ""God with us"" Christ translated means ""The anointed one"" The anointed one Jesus Christ has come to be with us. Luke 1:26-1:38 Read from Bible Mary, the innocent virgin God selected to birth His son was told to name him Jesus- Mary's response- ""May your word to me be fulfilled."" She was afraid, but knew that this was a God moment. Listen to this as her faith moves from curious to living faith. Luke 1:39-1:45 (Bible) ""At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea, where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. In a loud voice she exclaimed, ""Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in the womb leaped for joy. Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promise to her!"" Maybe I need to ask you a different question- Do you believe in miracles? Babies come in all shapes and sizes, and many different weights and lengths, but there was only one that came by the power of the Holy Spirit to a virgin. Do you believe that? That was a miracle. A supernatural birth that God Himself announced ahead of time and then made it happen for the redemption of mankind. Mark Batterson- ""Don't seek miracles. Follow Jesus. And if you follow Jesus long enough and far enough, you'll eventually find yourself in the middle of some miracles."" Augustine- I never have any difficulty believing in miracles since I experienced the miracle of a change in my own heart."" I believe in miracles. I believe miracles are supernatural things that God does for us because He cares for us and wants to be involved in our lives. I don't believe finding your keys in the basement after you lost them a year ago is a miracle, it is a circumstance. You found them where you left them. Finding them right after you pray is an answer to prayer. Jesus performed nine miracles I see in Scripture. I am sure He did more. Walking on water is a miracle. (Don't believe me try it) Healing someone terminally ill is a miracle. Water into wine- something supernatural, something that cannot be a coincidence or explainable."
Luke 2:25-38,"('Christmas', ""God's Gift"")",Nazarene," WHO STOLE CHRISTMAS? LUKE 2: 25-38 Introduction- Merry Christmas everyone! Sermon title- Who stole Christmas Asking who stole Christmas may seem like an odd thing to say tonight, but many have lost Christmas. To many it is about presents, food, and drink. Parties, time off and having a good time. When that is over, all that is left is the void and emptiness that was temporarily filled by stuff. The Grinch tried to do the same thing to the people of Whoville in the classic movie ""How the Grinch stole Christmas"". The problem for the Grinch was they did not base their joy on presents but on people. The people of God should not base Christmas on gifts and food, even though that is a way of expressing love to our families and friends. It is about the Christ-child who came from heaven to bring us the greatest gift of all time- Himself! Eternal life and the redemption of mankind. Who stole Christmas may seem strange as we sit tonight as we prepare to participate in a candlelight service. . THINK ABOUT IT: Happy Holidays instead of Merry Christmas To think that a few people upset have the power to change the majority and we let them. Saying winter break instead of Christmas break Giving holiday gifts instead of Christmas gifts. The Post Office having a Holiday stamp instead of a Christmas stamp Who made it what it is today and how do we get it back? Luke 2:1-2:7 Joseph and Mary pledged to be married Supernaturally God gives Mary the honor to carry into this world the savior of the world. Not born in style, not born to wealth, but humbly in nothing more than a barn. Just like God said, at the appointed time by the appointed people, God showed up in the flesh- Luke 2:8-14 Account of the angels and the shepherds The passage of Scripture that Fred read. God has made an announcement to the world the savior of the world has come and His name is Jesus. Illustration- On December 17, 1903, Orville and Wilbur Wright made their first flight of an airplane at Kitty Hawk, N.C. On their fifth attempt, the plane under the control of Orville embarked on a 12 second flight. Wilbur rushed to the local telegraph office and sent the following message - we have flown for 12 seconds. We will be home for Christmas. Upon receiving the telegraph, their sister Katherine went to the newspaper office and told of her brothers new flying machine, and informed them they would be home for Christmas if they would like to set up an interview. He assured her that he would put something in the paper regarding her brothers. On December 19th, the local paper placed the following headline on the sixth page of the newspaper ""Wright Brothers Home for Christmas."" The editor missed the story. In our rush, in all our gift giving, in all the things we do during the season... have we missed it? I heard the story of a woman who was doing her last minute shopping at a crowded mall. She was tired of fighting the crowds. She was tired of standing in lines. She was tired of fighting her way down long aisles looking for the perfect gift that had sold out a few days before. Her arms were full of bulky packages when the elevator door opened. It was full. The occupants of the elevator grudgingly tightened ranks to allow a small space for her and her load. As the door closed she blurted out, whoever is responsible for this whole Christmas thing ought to be arrested, strung up, and shot. A few others nodded their heads or grunted in agreement. Then, from somewhere in the back of the elevator came a single voice that said, ""Don't worry. They already crucified him."
Luke 2:1-16,"('Christmas', 'Jesus', 'Redeemer')",Nazarene," Christmas Love Everyday Luke 2:1-2:16 Here we are it is Christmas morning! Some of you have opened some presents already. Some are waiting till after the service. For most, it will be a day of giving and expressing your love for those that are close to you. I would hope, especially Christmas morning, that you have taken the time to express your love for Jesus. The greatest showing of love was Jesus Christ coming to mankind and providing a way of salvation. ""For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."" James Erwin ""There is something more important than man walking on the moon, and that is God, walking on the earth."" You take away hope and anticipation and you would have nothing left that is meaningful. Despair is the opposite of hope. Without God's hope and His love, man is incomplete. I want you for a moment to try to comprehend God's love. If you have never loved someone, you could not understand. If you have nothing to compare it to, you would not know what it is. Unless your heart has been broken, you will not know the worth of love and whether you would want to take a chance on love. God's love is not learned-God's love is discovered. (Repeat) The shepherds said- ""let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about."" The verse we have been looking at several services. In our busyness and our independence, I think it is sad that we are raising a generation that will not hear the Christmas story. They will know more about Frosty the Snowman than the heart of Christianity. At the heart of Christianity is the invitation to come see what God has done and to pursue Him with all our hearts. Discovery means that you are willing to go looking for something that is worthwhile and seek it out. We make a big deal about discovering God, but truth is, if He did not want to be found, we would not be able to find Him. Every year we battle to maintain Christmas manger scenes and Christmas plays. I want you to understand that if they were priorities in our life, we would not give them up so easily. God tells us how much He loves us, He shows us every day by desiring to be a part of our lives and interact with us. Do we show Him the love back? Where does He fit into our lives? We send out over 2 billion Christmas cards each year. Hallmark and other card companies make billions of dollars and most people do not look at the words that are inside, they just look to see if there is money in them. The birth of Jesus Christ is foretold- He came in the flesh, ""made His dwelling among us."" To those shepherds, to those that were willing to go look, they experienced the glory of God! We have to experience that by faith! We need the Holy Spirit of God to reveal those truths to us. We cannot live by the faith of others. We cannot experience the love of God without realizing what He has done for us and seek Him out. It is our responsibility to discover His love for ourselves. Until you have a personal experience with God, you will never really understand His love for you."
"2 Corinthians 5:11-17, Philippians 3:12-14","('New Year', ""New Year's Reflection"")",Nazarene," New Year; New Hope 2 Corinthians 5:11-5:17 Philippians 3:12-3:14 Prayer- Introduction- Scripture- Happy New Year! When we say Happy New Year what are we saying to someone? We are saying that we hope this New Year will be better than the year before. We verbally give them a blessing that their problems are behind them and blessings are in the future. Every year people stay up later than usual to see the old year go out and the New Year come in. Pa. has a lot of ways to see the New Year come in. You can stay up late and watch the ball drop on Times Square in New York. You can watch a strawberry, Pickle, or sausage drop. Here what some others do: Watermelon drop in Indiana Pine cone drop in Arizona Beach Ball drop in Florida Peach drop in Georgia A 1000 lb. piece of cheese drop in Plymouth Wisconsin. Truth is, each one of us has a hope and some kind of expectation that the new one will be better. Bill Vaugh: Optimist stays up till midnight to see the New Year in. A pessimist stays up to make sure the old year leaves. I think everyone of us needs to take time to evaluate the old year going out and the New Year coming in. Ask yourself these questions- What do you want to see happen in 2017 What things need to change in 2017? Apostle Paul is telling us that if we are in Christ that the old is gone, the new has come. All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself. He is telling us that we are Christ's ambassadors. What is your attitude toward the New Year? Are you looking at 2017 as an unbeliever with no hope or as a Christ Ambassador with all the resources of heaven available to you to have an amazing New Year. Every year offers us a chance at a new beginning and offers us new hope, But how many of us really believe that, or put ourselves in a position to receive it from the Lord? Most people look forward to a new year for a new start, but carry the same old habits and hang ups with them. Illustration- Wife came into the bathroom to see her husband on the scale with his stomach sucked in. she told him that sucking in his stomach would not make it better. He said that it would, because if he didn't, he couldn't read the numbers. We make resolutions like ....I quit this...., I'll start this...., I would say this. Resolutions that most of the time are not kept even the first month. Little boy asked his father what his new year's resolution was. ""He was going to do everything possible in this New year to make his mother very happy."" The little boy then asked his mother the same question. She said, ""To do everything possible to make sure your father keeps his resolution."" If you do not believe anything will change in 2017- it won't. (Repeat) If you do nothing different, you will not see different results. If you need to be reminded that you need God in your life to make a difference, you are in trouble. If you are trying to fix yourself, find someone to blame, you are in trouble. 2017 will have renewed purpose when we understand that without the Lord , 2017 will just be another year, another resolution, another goal, but it won't be a new life!"
James 1:5-18,"('Wisdom', 'Temptation', 'Trials')",Nazarene," Life's Pitfalls and Discoveries Wisdom with Trials and Temptations James chapter 1:5-1:18 Introduction- Good morning everyone, today we continue our study of the pitfalls of life and the discoveries that can be found to help us avoid them. Last week we looked at un-forgiveness as the pitfall and the discovery that forgiveness can set a person free and allows us to live as God intended. We all want forgiveness when we make mistakes but few are willing to give forgiveness when someone else makes a mistake or does us wrong. Today I want to look at putting the necessary guidelines in our life that serve as a bumper when we begin to go off track. James records some important text on the subject and we will break it down into two sessions, (1) looking at the wisdom that is available if we are willing to hear it and (2) About keeping our minds centered and focused on God so that we don't stumble and set ourselves up for failure. James chapter 1:5-1:18 Read from Bible Illustration- (SermonCentral) George W. Bush, in an airport lobby, noticed a man in a flowing white robe with a long flowing white beard and flowing white hair. The man had a staff in one hand and some stone tablets under the other arm. George W. approached the man and inquired, ""Aren't you Moses?"" The man ignored George W. and stared at the ceiling. George W. positioned himself more directly in the man's view and asked again, ""Aren't you Moses?"" The man continued to look at the ceiling. George W. tugged at the man's sleeve and asked once again, ""Aren't you Moses?"" The man finally replied, the last time I spoke to a bush I had to spend forty years in the desert. The only way to have a better life, to have a fulfilling life is by listening and doing what the Lord has told us in His Word to us. John 10:10- ""The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy, I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full."" The thief (Satan) has come to destroy everything in your life of worth and take away the joy and fulfillment that God promises by telling you and convincing you that you can do whatever you want and be satisfied and complete and it is a lie straight out of Hell and smells like smoke. I do not see a devil behind every door but I see lives destroyed because they have turned their back on God and think that they knew better than God for their lives and they are a mess. This has been a hard month for me, I saw two of my friends my age pass away and it is a reality check to make sure that we have things right in our lives. One I am confident is with the Lord and one that I am not sure of and breaks my heart to think he could be lost for eternity. Guidelines and guard rails are set up by God to help us and guide us and we have the option of (1) Trusting God with our lives and our future or (2) Do things our way. ""If any of you lack wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him."" I think God has a sense of humor. If you don't believe me think about this- God who tells us if we lack wisdom, He will give us wisdom. Compared to God, who would know more? Who would be the one lacking wisdom? Would anyone of us honestly want to challenge God on who knows best?"
1 Timothy 4:12,"('Character', 'Speech', 'Purity Of Life', 'Cowboy')",Christian Church," ""It's Time to Cowboy Up!"" Text: 1 Timothy 4:12 Theme: Setting an Example through a God-honoring Lifestyle Living across the street from Silver Spurs Arena in Kissimmee, Val (my wife) and I have taken to attending rodeos. Now I'm a city boy. I grew up near downtown Fort Myers, FL. It wasn't a big city back then, but it certainly was not rural. As a kid, I never rode a horse or ""punched a cow."" So, I freely admit that there are a number of things that cow folk do that I just can't see myself doing. I think barrow racing would be fun, even if it is a girl's event. I can see myself calf roping. I know it isn't easy, but it does at least look like fun. I can see why someone who works and lives with horses and cattle would need such skills and want to perfect them. I can even see the need for bronco bursting--though I have no desire to try it. But what about those guys that ride the bulls? I mean, that's not necessary is it? It's not even normal! Who is their right mind says to an attack beast that's 2,000 pounds of muscle and bad attitude, with horns, ""Come get some!""? I have a friend in Colorado who used to ride the bulls. Believe it or not, it was a high school sports team event. He swears it's tons of fun and greatly impresses the ladies. ""It looks painful."" I said to him. ""Hey!"" he says. ""Sometimes you've got to cowboy up!"" Now, the best I can tell, ""Cowboy up"" generally means to have the courage to do what needs to be done--even if the doing is difficult or requires significant sacrifice. It means moving beyond your fear and not allowing circumstances to define you. It means taking responsibility for your own life, making choices and standing by them. It means refusing to quit on what you believe in and working hard to reach your goals. Setting aside the macho man nonsense and the illusion of the self-made man that is sometimes attached to the phrase, I like this idea. That's why I've entitled this sermon, ""Father's Day: It's Time to Cowboy Up!"" Now ladies, I want to invite you to set back and relax. I'm going to be talking to the guys this morning. But you'll want to listen in carefully because the boys and I are going to talk about how to cowboy up as true, whole and authentic men living well before God. Gitti-up! In 1 Timothy 4:12, Paul says to Timothy: ""Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity."" The Greek word translated ""set an example"" was used to describe making a mold from which an object or shape could be duplicated. Paul wants Timothy to step up to the challenge of being an example of a god-honoring man. To appreciate Paul challenge (command), we must understand a bit about the life circumstances that Paul and Timothy were facing. 1 Timothy is a letter written by Paul to encourage Timothy and give him advice as a younger minister. Note that Paul begins this verse by writing, ""Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young."" This letter was written around 63 AD. By this time, Paul is probably in his sixties and Timothy is in his late 20s or early 30s. Timothy is a servant-leader (minister) within the community of Christians living in the city of Ephesus. It is clear from Paul's letter that there were those in that ""church"" that were ignorant about God's words and ways, but put themselves forward as Christian teachers and tried to dismiss Timothy as a not being old enough to know better. Paul's response is to challenge Timothy to (1) teach the truth, (2) live an exemplary life and (3) train others to do the same. No doubt Timothy was feeling the pressure and facing his fears when Paul writes to him. Paul knows that God is watching and supporting Timothy's ministry, but that doesn't insulate Timothy from hardship, and it does negate the need for him to personally step-up to the challenges before him. ""You set an example,"" Paul says. It's time to cowboy up!"
Nehemiah 1:4-6,"('Sin', 'Confession', 'Challenges Of Life')",Baptist," Facing Life's Challenges Nehemiah 1: 4-6 Most of us right now, are consumed with enormous challenges in our personal lives. We may appear to live carefree lives, and we look good on the outside, but on the inside, we are consumed with dealing with this over here and that over there, and it seems like there is no resolution to be found in the other. Collectively, we have health challenges. Family Challenges. Unexpected challenges. Challenges of uncertainty. Political challenges. Not knowing which direction our country is headed next. Challenges of an unjust, criminal justice system, who justifies targeting unarmed teens, in other words, there is a challenge of being a human being. The challenge of being arrested for no reason, and the questionable, mysterious murders of innocent people, because of personal choice. Today, as we come face to face with challenges, I want us to look deep, beneath the surface and look to the POSSIBILITY, brighter days up ahead. In life, there are situations on every hand that presents us with a challenge, but God already knows the outcome. Perhaps He wants us to reveal to us the extent of our faith. Maybe He wants to prove to us, if the faith we say we have, is it really real. For too long, we've done a lot of talking, but are we willing to put some action behind it. God in His infinite wisdom has a greater plan than what we can see right now. A plan designed to challenge us. A plan specifically designed to grow us up in Him. A plan that makes each of us aware that we too have a SPIRIT OF TENACITY like Nehemiah. A SPIRIT, that doesn't give up easily, a SPIRIT that will go the distance in the face of a challenge. Nehemiah faced a challenge, and his witness laid a foundation, not only to build upon, but he laid before us a springboard, so that we too can rebound in facing life's challenges. Is it easy? No, it's not. But's not about GIVING UP It's about GIVING IN and trusting God. In the text, we find that Nehemiah is a cupbearer. One who was a loyal and trustworthy servant to the king. He knows his history and the disobedience, of his ancestors. And he knows that because of his ancestor's disobedience, they were lead into Babylonian captivity for 70 years. Over a period of time and under the leadership of Cyrus, King of Persia, the remnant, being those who lived thru it, they were finally allowed to return to Jerusalem, IF they chose. They were going home to rebuild. If you remember that back in 2 Chronicles 36, the people HAD GOTTEN OUT OF HAND. they mocked God's messengers, despised God's word, and misused the prophets, they thought they GOT AWAY with it, UNTIL, the WRATH of the Lord rose up AGAINST them. The house of God was burnt down, broke down the wall, and the land was desolate. Countless people died, while others were carried off and held captive in Babylon. Nehemiah was one of the one's who chose NOT to go back. The remnant rebuilt the temple, during the days of Ezra. SO NOW, the people had a temple, that was COMPLETED and DEDICATED to the Lord, in (Ezra Chapter 6) but they were living their lives in the midst of the unsightly, unprotected, devastating destruction of the gates and wall of Jerusalem."
Job 1:1-42:1,"('Elderly', 'Disability', 'Nursing Home', 'Self-Pity')",Baptist," I Want You! I'm going to read you a list & see if you can tell me what these things have in common; traumatic brain injury, deafness/blindness, chronic illness, physical disorder, mental impairment, eating disorders, insomnia, chronic fatigue syndrome, speech difficulty, learning disorder. What do those items have in common? They are all different types of disabilities. As we age disabilities creep up on us & prevent us from doing many of the things we enjoyed earlier in life. That list is a few of many types of disabilities. One that was not on the list, and perhaps the most elusive disability of all, is self-pity. When we get older it seems like almost every joint starts to ache because of injury, surgery, arthritis, or some other reason. We also lose the strength we once had. Because of the miracles of modern medical achievements, we are living longer. These advances are a blessing from The Lord. But weakness & pain are almost always present as we get older. We currently have over 15,000 certified nursing homes in the United States that care for those who need it. When we are not able to get out & do the things we once did; such as tend to the flower bed, walk around the yard, play with our grandkids, or other activities, we move to one of these homes. We then question what purpose God has for us when all we do is sit in our chair or lay in bed & watch TV. How can that be of any service to Him? We see no purpose for this life & we pity ourselves. Our Heavenly Father did not create man to feel worthless & pity ourselves for the condition we're in. Look how valuable we are to Him! He gave the life of His only begotten Son so that we will be forgiven for our sins & be with Him for eternity. In return we should desire to devote ourselves to the Lord in service every second of our lives. We ask how our Lord can use us when we are unable to do almost everything. God will give you the power and ability to accomplish His sovereign will. If the Holy Spirit reveals what God wants, He will also provide for us a way to do it. Because we are not able to be what we consider to be effective part of God's calling the question ""WHY?"" comes up many times. Questions like ""'Why has He allowed this to happen?' 'What did I do to deserve this?' & 'What can I do for Him now?'"" often cross our minds. We should understand that God has a reason for everything that happens. He either caused it to happen or allowed it to happen. If anyone in the history of the world had reason to ask ""WHY?"" & pity himself it was God's servant Job. Job was living a good life with wealth as a successful farmer, herdsman, & landowner. He had hundreds of heads of cattle & thousands of sheep. God also found him to be faithful, blameless, & upright. He was the greatest man in all the people of the East. God had blessed him greatly. Satan tried to prove to the Lord that the only reason Job was like this was because of his many possessions. The devil was going to prove Job to be a liar; or so he thought. He was going to try to show God what Job really loved was his many possessions. God gave Satan His permission to take these things from Job. Satan grinned & put his plan to action. In less than one day Job lost everything! When he found out about all that had been taken from him Job grieved deeply. In a matter of hours, he lost 1000 donkeys & oxen, 7000 sheep, 3000 camels, & all 10 of his children. After this happened Job shaved his head, fell to his knees to worship God, & said, ""Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD."" (Job 1:21)"
Matthew 18:21-35,"('Forgiveness', 'Unforgiveness')",Nazarene," Life's pitfalls and discoveries The power of forgiveness Introduction- Today we begin a new series titled Life's pitfalls and discoveries. What I want us to look at is seeing things that cause us to get off track with our walk with God and discover things that can get us back on track, keep us from getting off track, and what it will take to stay on track. If it goes well, each week we will look at one pitfall and end on a positive discovery. We should be able to grab encouragement from each sermon. It is not about what the person next to you needs to hear, but what you need to hear. I hope each one of us can go deeper with our relationship with God and that you will want to go deeper. This morning we talk about un-forgiveness and forgiveness. It will be our pitfall and our discovery. We will look on both sides of when we do not forgive and the discovery that is ours when we do forgive. Matthew 18:21-35 read from Bible Funny thing about forgiveness- we all want it but we all do not want to give it. When Peter approached Jesus and asked if seven times was enough times to forgive someone, He thought He was being generous. Seven is the amount of times that Jewish custom would tell you was enough times to forgive someone. He thought he would show Jesus how well he knew Jewish law. Jesus tripped him up by countering with 70x7. Jesus was really showing Peter that it is not the number of times, but that we have to forgive. Jesus moves into a parable to show Peter what was expected. When we hear the parable we think the ungrateful man was a monster because he was forgiven so much and would not extend that forgiveness downstream to someone in his point of contact. If the story was told today, it would be the same. How many are not willing to forgive knowing how much that they have been forgiven? How many want forgiveness but are not willing to extend forgiveness to someone else. There are people today that cannot let anything go. If you do them wrong they never forget. They live their whole lives looking under the microscope of other people faults and never looking what they themselves are doing to other people by their actions. Hurting people hurt people- continually, everyday, on purpose and without mercy. Wanting, even demanding forgiveness but never giving any. I will never forgive him/her! You don't know what they did to me! Being a true Christian and a true believer of Jesus Christ has never been about being better than anyone else. It is understanding what Christ did for us and being grateful. Being a Christian has been about being different. We know what Christ did for us and we cannot live our lives with un-forgiveness knowing what Christ did for us. Lives are like a dash- They have a starting point and an ending point. The dash is the time between the two points. All of us know when we were born, but none of know when we will die. What we do with that time is what we will stay before God and give an account for. King David long before he was King David was living his dash. He was not born rich, was not from famous parents, but even as a teenager was making an impact and mark in life."
Ephesians 1:4-6,"('Salvation', 'Election')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Scripture We are currently in a series of sermons on Ephesians 1 that I am calling, ""God's Supreme Purpose."" The Apostle Paul's emphasis in chapter 1 is not on what we must do for salvation, but rather on what God has done for us in Christ. Ephesians 1:3-14 shows us how each Person of the Trinity is involved in the salvation of God's people. Our salvation was planned by the Father (1:4-6), purchased by the Son (1:7-12), and sealed by the Holy Spirit (1:13-14). Let's read about the Father's plan of salvation in Ephesians 1:4-6. For the sake of context, we shall begin reading at verse 3: 3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, 4 even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love 5 he predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will, 6 to the praise of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved. (Ephesians 1:4-6) Introduction Dr. J. I. Packer wrote a famous introductory essay to John Owen's (1616-1683) Death of Death in the Death of Christ. In the essay, Dr. Packer suggests that the statement, ""God saves sinners,"" is a summary of the gospel. Here is what Packer wrote: God saves sinners. God - the Triune Jehovah, Father, Son and Spirit; three Persons working together in sovereign wisdom, power and love to achieve the salvation of a chosen people, the Father electing, the Son fulfilling the Father's will by redeeming, the Spirit executing the purpose of Father and Son by renewing. Saves - does everything, first to last, that is involved in bringing man from death in sin to life in glory: plans, achieves and communicates redemption, calls and keeps, justifies, sanctifies, glorifies. Sinners - men as God finds them, guilty, vile, helpless, powerless, blind, unable to lift a finger to do God's will or better their spiritual lot. We would be hard pressed to find a better summary of the gospel. ""God saves sinners"" is a simple and short statement but, properly understood, a deep and profound statement. The Apostle Paul also gave a deep and profound statement of the gospel in Ephesians 1:3-14. It is not a simple and short statement. In fact, Ephesians 1:3-14 is one, long, complex sentence in the original Greek. However, as we unpack that sentence, we learn how each Person of the Trinity is actively involved in our salvation. And it all begins with God the Father's plan of salvation. Lesson The analysis of the Father's plan of salvation in Ephesians 1:4-6 shows us seven elements in that plan. Let's use the following outline: 1. The Method in the Father's Plan of Salvation Is Election (1:4a) 2. The Object in the Father's Plan of Salvation Is the Elect (1:4b) 3. The Time in the Father's Plan of Salvation Is Eternity Past (1:4c) 4. The Purpose in the Father's Plan of Salvation Is Holiness (1:4d) 5. The Motive in the Father's Plan of Salvation Is Love (1:4e)"
Ephesians 4:28,"('Selfless', 'Selfish', 'Selflessness')",Christian/Church Of Christ," INTRODUCTION "" SLIDE #1 "" Edward Blaine who had spent 20 years in prison for bank robbery back in 1963 thought he would try again in 2003 in Spotsylvania County, Virginia. "" According to The Free-Lance Star of Fredericksburg, Blaine walked up to two tellers at Union Bank & Trust and ordered them to ""be cool"" and give him all the money in large bills. The culprit had a gun in his pocket, Johnson said, but never pulled it out. "" He received several thousand dollars from two surprised bank cashiers at the Union Bank and Trust in Port Royal, and as he fled he spilled $100 notes in his wake as he attempted to stuff the cash into his pockets and get away. "" When he reached his hired getaway car he realized that he had locked his keys inside. Then Mr. Blaine began beating on the window with a piece of wood. The commotion drew the attention of two civilians, who began chasing him. "" The fleeing felon attempted to pull out his gun but failed, and shot himself in his leg but kept fighting his would be arresters; one of whom shot the suspect in the leg also. "" The local police charged the robber with 8 felonies, including robbery and 2 counts of attempted murder. The suspect was attended to in hospital and recovered. http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bungling-burglar-has-ivery-i-bad-day/ "" When one accepts Jesus as their Lord and Savior, our life should start to change. "" For some people the change is fast and dramatic, for others, it is much slower; nonetheless, because of who we now belong to, our life should be different than the life that we lived before we accepted Jesus. "" The passage we are going to dig though today is one that deals with stealing and no longer stealing. "" We are not to steal, and most of us probably think we have either never stolen anything. "" In our time together this morning, we will look at the issue of stealing; however, we are going to focus on the heart behind what drives one to steal versus the type of heart one in Christ should possess. "" SLIDE #2 "" Ephesians 4:28 (HCSB) The thief must no longer steal. Instead, he must do honest work with his own hands, so that he has something to share with anyone in need. "" SLIDE #3 SERMON I. The old way of life centered on being selfish. "" Paul is writing to the church that is very young and is full of folks who were from the Gentile world. "" Those who came to Jesus as Jews had a stronger base from which to build from; however, those who were Gentiles, for the most part did not have a strong base from which to build their faith. "" So here Paul addresses what would seem to be one of those Captain Obvious moments, THE THIEF MUST NO LONGER STEAL! "" I would hope as we are engaged together this morning, that we do not have to deal with the issue of stealing; however, there are many in our country who struggle with this sin. "" According to the web site Business 2 Community, from statistics from 2015, the amount stolen annually from U.S. businesses by employees stands at $50 billion. "" I do not believe that includes the cost to business for loss prevention."
Ezra 1:1-3,"('Restoration', 'Exile', 'Redeeming Love', 'Fulfilled Prophecy')",Baptist," WWelcome back. It's good to see you again. For those who were not here last week, I will introduce myself again. I am Ezra. I am, by vocation, a priest and a scribe, a record keeper. I am also a teacher of the Law. I served the Lord during the Restoration, the most exciting time in our history since the Exodus. Last week, we saw how the Exile fulfilled between eight hudred and nine hundred years of prophecy, from Leviticus to Jeremiah. Centuries of prophecy became our history. One prophecy we did not look at is in Isaiah 44. ""Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer, Who formed you from the womb... Who says of Cyrus, 'He is My shepherd, and he shall fulfill all My purpose;' saying of Jerusalem, 'She shall be built,' and of the temple, 'Your foundation shall be laid,'"" Is 44:24, 28. Josephus wrote in his ""Antiquities of the Jews"" (11:1:2) that Cyrus read this prophecy in Isaiah, naming him over a hundred years before he was born, and ""an earnest desire and ambition seized upon him to fulfill what was so written..."" Not only did he have an earnest desire and ambition to fulfill what was written, he was determined to build a temple more massive than Solomon's Temple. ""Its height shall be sixty cubits and its breadth sixty cubits, with three layers of great stones and one layer of timber,"" Ezra 6:3-4. This temple was to be twice as high and three times as wide as the first. If people fondly remembered the Solomon's Temple centuries after it was built and decades after it was destroyed, perhaps they would be more impressed with Cyrus' Temple. Last week, we saw that he allowed people to return home and take their idols with them because he wanted local people and local gods praying to his gods for his good. The Jews had no idols to return. Maybe he thought building a more massive temple would intimidate the God of Israel. Noooooooooo. Cyrus' reasons for building the temple don't matter. God gave His people a priority. Build the temple. He stirred the heart of the king to make it possible. They started well. They prepared for building. They laid the foundation. They started only to give up. They decided to add paneling to their walls before God's house even had walls. They decided it was not yet time to build the temple. God called two prophets, Haggai and Zechariah, to call the people back to work. As I wrote in my book, ""The work on the house of God that is in Jerusalem stopped, and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia... Now the prophets, Haggai and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel who was over them. Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak arose and began to rebuild the house of God that is in Jerusalem, and the prophets of God were with them, supporting them,"" Ezra 4:24; 5:1-2 Haggai was first to express God's displeasure. Notice, in particular, the date and God's choice of words in referring to the people. ""In the second year of Darius the King, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came by the hand of Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest: 'Thus says the Lord of hosts: These people say the time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the Lord.' Then the word of the Lord came by the hand of Haggai the prophet, 'Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins? Now, therefore, thus says the Lord of hosts: Consider your ways,'"" Haggai 1:1-5."
Revelation 8:12,"('Book Of Revelation', 'Fourth Trumpet', 'Sun', 'Moon', 'Stars')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 4-12-2016 Series: Verse By Verse Through Revelation Title: Fourth Trumpet: Third of Sun, Moon, and Stars Struck, Affecting Day and Night (Revelation 8:12) Revelation 8:12 (KJV) 12 And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise. Introduction The fourth angel's trumpet sound struck a third of the sun, moon, and stars. This affects the structure of the universe. Everything from the remaining plant life and even the tides in the oceans would be changed. Certainly, as described, the natural amount of daylight would be altered. The judgments from the first three trumpets affected only a third part of the land and waters, but this fourth judgment affects the entire world. Why? Because it gets to the very source of the earth's life and energy, the sun. With one third less sunlight on the earth there would be one third less energy available to support the Life Systems of man and nature. This judgment parallels the ninth plague in Egypt (Exodus 10:21-23), which lasted three days. ""The Day of the Lord is darkness, and not light"" (Amos 5:18). Think of the vast changes in temperatures that will occur and how these will affect human health and food growth. Commentary ""And the fourth angel sounded."" The ""fourth angel sounded"" his trumpet and the celestial bodies were affected. The darkness of the fourth trumpet judgment set the stage for the last three trumpets that would bring demonic activity on the earth. Here is a prophecy, the fulfillment of which will baffle all scientists who have made a study of the heavenly bodies. The events recorded here are similar to those under the sixth seal (6:12-14). They are predicted clearly by Christ Himself: ""There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea. People will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken. At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near"" (Luke 21:25-28). No scientific answer will be able to explain adequately these astronomical effects. Apart from the intervention of the sovereign Creator of all things, there can be no explanation. These are the judgments of God going forth in the earth. On the fourth day He brought the sun, Moon, and stars into view in order to provide light for man; under the fourth trumpet He shall withdraw the light He Himself created. All of this will affect seriously the health and well-being of people on the earth at that time. This will disturb the seasons and hinder the growth of fruits and vegetables."
2 Timothy 1:1-8,"('Politics', 'Politician', 'Poor', 'Bishop', 'Hierarchy')",Catholic," Thursday of Third Week in Course 2017 Joy of the Gospel Ss Timothy and Titus Today's feast is a challenge to those whose denomination teaches that the Church is not hierarchical. Most of these denominations consider themselves Bible fundamentalists, but today's readings clearly show that, from the beginning, the Church had a well-defined leadership cadre, in doctrine, liturgy and authority. Ss Timothy and Titus were bishops, in Ephesus and Crete, during the period of St. Paul's ministry. They were ordained-that's what ""laying on of hands"" means. All of us Catholics who bear the mark of holy orders had a bishop lay hands on our heads. Then the bishop put the Book of the Gospels into our deacon hands and told us to live what we preach, and preach what we read. Deacons are ordained primarily for service, priests for sacrifice and reconciliation, and bishops for headship. It is Christ's idea, not some mere human's. In this week we in the United States are experiencing the secular leadership of a new national administration. Politics is in the headlines. The Holy Father understands politics, and writes as he muses on the application of economics to social justice for the poor: 'I ask God to give us more politicians capable of sincere and effective dialogue aimed at healing the deepest roots - and not simply the appearances - of the evils in our world! Politics, though often denigrated, remains a lofty vocation and one of the highest forms of charity, inasmuch as it seeks the common good. We need to be convinced that charity ""is the principle not only of micro-relationships (with friends, with family members or within small groups) but also of macro-relationships (social, economic and political ones)"". I beg the Lord to grant us more politicians who are genuinely disturbed by the state of society, the people, the lives of the poor! It is vital that government leaders and financial leaders take heed and broaden their horizons, working to ensure that all citizens have dignified work, education and healthcare. Why not turn to God and ask him to inspire their plans? I am firmly convinced that openness to the transcendent can bring about a new political and economic mindset which would help to break down the wall of separation between the economy and the common good of society. 'Economy, as the very word indicates, should be the art of achieving a fitting management of our common home, which is the world as a whole. Each meaningful economic decision made in one part of the world has repercussions everywhere else; consequently, no government can act without regard for shared responsibility. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find local solutions for enormous global problems which overwhelm local politics with difficulties to resolve. If we really want to achieve a healthy world economy, what is needed at this juncture of history is a more efficient way of interacting which, with due regard for the sovereignty of each nation, ensures the economic well-being of all countries, not just of a few."
"Isaiah 5:20, 1 Corinthians 14:33","('Truth And Lies', 'Manipulators', 'Confusion Of Mind', 'Liars')",Salvation Army," Pray for Discernment: Fight The Confusion Capt. Kelly Durant Isaiah 5:20 Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter. 1 Corinthians 14:33 For God is not the author of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints. 2. How many of you have ever been confused? Your driving around and you miss the expressway exit and get off late ending up in a neighbor where gangs of people on the street corners staring at you as you drive by? You don't dare ask directions! You then go in circles 30 minutes until you finally find your way out of that hood! Has it ever happened to you? I think all of us at some time or another have been confused, confused by unclear directions, confused by algebra in school, or confused by people we have met who claim to live by a certain beliefs which proclaim friendship or peace yet their actions indicate that they do not practice these in real life. Today the biggest double standard confusing scenario is this: A person loving and defending certain groups of people (who may have a horrendous record) who demand that no discrimination be taken against them while at the same time labeling others who disagree with them as persons to hate and attack! Hypocrites today are getting away with coning the average person because of the confusion of what is good and what is evil! What's not helping is that most current civil laws are man's laws, and are not God's laws, and this contradiction is what is provoking a massive great confusion. Out of this confusion arises frustration and aggression causing insecurity, self-righteousness, hypocrisy and pride. Consequently, evil invites its own self-destruction when exposed how hypocritical it is! Confusion of logical thought, of values, of correct or faulty science is dominating the entire world today! Also to some degree there is some possible confusion in your own mind on a few subject matters as well! It is like that quote that says, 'Most people are like cement, all mixed up and permanently set.' It sometimes takes years for you and others to sort out truth and fact from deception and lies and all of us will only be able to if we know God's Word, live in holiness and obedience, and having the Holy Spirit active daily. Considering we are intelligent people using the brain God gave us, we should be obsessed with discerning what is the absolute truths of God filtered through our purified and transformed mind shunning the fallacies of the world's current indoctrinations. 3. Hypocritical double standard Satanic people have always been the accusers of the saints and the haters of God and His people because they practice sin and they can only view everything upside down through a cloudy biased filter. These people always find fault and harassingly accuse the sincere righteous people of God in order to draw the attention away from their own filthy selves. Because they will not accept truth or facts unless they repent, with these types of confused sinners you will never win in an argument. Because black is white to them, you end up 'damned if you do, or damned if you don't' concerning any discussion on any subject matter. They want to be the ones on top by aggression, by emotion, and by contradiction instead of being open to logic, righteousness, and God's statutes to rule."
Ezekiel 37:1-14,"('Preaching', 'Prayer', 'Revival', 'The Holy Spirit')",Independent/Bible," An early morning fire that completely destroyed the historic Hortop Mill in Everton on this past Thursday, Jan. 19 is being treated as suspicious. The original fire call came in at about 3:30am and when firefighters arrived at the mill, located on Evert Street, just south of the Eramosa River, it was fully-engulfed with flames. Crews from Guelph-Eramosa, Puslinch, Guelph, and Hillsburgh, could not prevent the total destruction of the Mill. (http://www.wellingtonadvertiser.com/comments/index.cfm?articleID=34275). When all is said and done, neither the residents of Everton, the GRCA, nor the remnants of the mill itself can bring the mill back to its previous glory with what is left there. Any hope for the site must come in a complete rebuilding. The situation in Ezekiel 37 was bleak. It is proclaimed to the exiles, probably sometime between the dates presented in 33:21 and 40:1, around 572 B.C. (Lind, M. (1996). Ezekiel (p. 296). Scottdale, PA: Herald Press.) Israel was a defeated nation. It had been crushed militarily, its people had been separated from one another in exile, and it had suffered the inevitable result of its abandonment of the Lord. Alone, exhausted, discouraged, and impoverished, Israel was indeed as good as dead. (But the vision to Ezekiel was fitted to dispel such despondent reflections.) (Stuart, D., & Ogilvie, L. J. (1989). Ezekiel (Vol. 20, p. 332). Nashville, TN: Thomas Nelson Inc.) How do we move on after times of discouragement or loss? It's easy to see past greatness or success in relationships or opportunities and long for what was. God however doesn't want us to live in the past, but consider what can be. Revival is God taking what seems hopeless and showing what He can do. Using human secondary means, God can accomplish what seems impossible from a human standpoint. How does revival happen? God uses three means to accomplish it. He uses: 1) The Preaching of the Word (Ezekiel 37:1-6), 2) The Prayer of God's Servant (Ezekiel 37:7-9), The Power of the Holy Spirit (Ezekiel 37:5-14). In order to accomplish Revival, God uses: 1) The Preaching of the Word (Ezekiel 37:1-4) Ezekiel 37:1-6 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of the LORD and set me down in the middle of the valley; it was full of bones. 2 And he led me around among them, and behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley, and behold, they were very dry. 3 And he said to me, ""Son of man, can these bones live?"" And I answered, ""O Lord GOD, you know."" 4 Then he said to me, ""Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD. 5 Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live. 6 And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the LORD."" (ESV) Ezekiel's beginning in chapter 37 where he says that: ""The hand of the LORD was upon me"" appears to indicate something extraordinary and unusual in the prophet's experience. In this whole vision the prophet was the subject of a special and intensified inspiration. The process described that God: ""brought/carried"" him. That Ezekiel was ""brought/carried ...out in the spirit"" notes how this was not a physical moving but a vision.( Jamieson, R., Fausset, A. R., & Brown, D. (1997). Commentary Critical and Explanatory on the Whole Bible (Vol. 1, p. 610). Oak Harbor, WA: Logos Research Systems, Inc.)"
John 14:1-6,"('Preparation', ""God's Promises"", 'Person Of Jesus', 'Precious Promises', ""God's Dwelling Place"")",Christian/Church Of Christ," Message from John 14:1-6, one of 2 Scriptures Catherine mentioned This passage speaks of a person, a preparation, a place, and a promise 1. A person Many in today's world tell us, ""Believe in yourself."" Roy T. Bennett in his book, The Light in the Heart said, ""Believe in yourself. You are braver than you think, more talented than you know, and capable of more than you imagine."" I am the worst sinner that I know. I am capable of much evil, more than you could imagine. No, I need to have faith in someone holier, greater and more noble than I. Need to believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God. This is whom Catherine believed in, whom she had faith in, whom she trusted in. Faith in Jesus Christ is the difference maker for all eternity. John 14:6 2. A preparation Jesus is making preparations for us. This going was begun by Jesus' death on the cross and completed at his ascension. His death, resurrection, and ascension to heaven, are all essential parts of going to the Father to prepare a place for his disciples. Since Jesus is making preparations for us we need to make preparations to meet him. This brings me to the other verses that Catherine wanted at her funeral. In John 11 a friend of Jesus, Lazarus, is dead. Jesus goes to be with his sisters Mary and Martha. Martha is the first to meet him and Jesus and Martha have a conversation before joining everyone else. In that conversation Jesus says, ""I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?"""" John 11:25, 26, NIV. These verses are a paradox. Through Jesus we will never suffer eternal death, being separated from God. If we believe in Jesus we will live, even though we die physically. If we believe and live in Jesus we will never die, never be separated from God. ""For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."" Romans 8:38, 39, NIV. First step is to believe. John 3:16 From this we repent. ""Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret"" 2 Corinthians 7:10, NIV. We confess like Martha did- """"Yes, Lord,"" she told him, ""I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world."""" John 11:27, NIV. We are baptized like Jesus told Nicodemus- """"I tell you the truth, no-one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit."" John 3:5, NIV. **Acts 2:38** These are things that Catherine did many years ago. What a joy it must have been for Catherine to see her two daughters baptized. Brenda was baptized just a few years ago. Tell the story 3. A place In Bible days, the groom would prepare the place where he and his bride would live and then he would go get her and bring her to their new home."
Romans 2:4,"('Repentance', 'Obedience From Heart', 'Holiness Of God', 'Character Of God')",Baptist," REPENTANCE SERIES Online Sermon: http://www.mckeesfamily.com/?page_id=3567 From the moment, God created humanity from the dust of the ground onwards we have been struggling to know and have a relationship with our Creator. You would think the ambassadors of Christ and royal priests that have been sealed by the Spirit of God would have little difficulty knowing, accepting and striving towards fulfilling God's command to be holy. How I wish that was the case! Like Paul, we often gratify the evil desires of our sinful nature and thus miss the mark of holiness every single day. Sin leaves us distant from a holy God who refuses to be close to those spiritual babies who continue to covet their strongholds of sin. Since there is no sin that the blood of Christ cannot wash away then why do our attempts of confession and repentance seem to be nothing more than an exercise in futility? How can one repent and yet remain a wretched, blind beggar thirsty to know one's own Creator? The problem of course is not with God. To those who truly repent He always forgives and cleanses from all unrighteousness. If you draw near to God He will draw near to you. The reason why holiness and closeness to God remain beyond our reach is because we do not know how to repent in a God-fearing manner! This five-part sermon series will begin looking at the God's command to repent and a discussion on how offensive sin to the character of a holy God. Next, the series will identify some of the myths of what repentance is not so that one can stop wasting one's time repenting one's own way. Third, the series will outline the need to embrace the right motives of repentance. Fourth, the series will outline a model of practical steps that will teach one how to repent God's way. And lastly, this series will finish by outlining the fruits of repentance. Before I begin I would like to give credit where credit is due. There are four books that I relied heavily on when writing this sermon series. For a full doctrine of repentance, I turned to Richard Owen Roberts ""Repentance: The First Word of the Gospel"" and Thomas Watson's ""The Doctrine of Repentance."" For everyday issues concerning repentance, I turned to C. John Miller's book ""Repentance: A Daring Call to Real Surrender"" and Stephen Baker's book ""Repentance: Gods Marvelous Gift."" While all these workers were an amazing source of information, I primarily relied on commentaries and God's holy word. PART 1: REPENTANCE, SIN AND THE CHARACTER OF GOD Romans 2:4 Given how hard it is to break the strongholds of sin, one should not be surprised that the very first word of the gospel message is not ""love"" or ""grace"" but ""repent."" Even though a man dressed in camel's hair with a palate of locusts and wild honey and the desert for a church building might seem strange to us today, so must be his message ""repent for the kingdom of God is near"" or Christians everywhere would have already attained holiness! In a culture that no longer believes in absolute truth, right living has been relegated to a sea of ever changing motives and desires. Missing the mark of God's perfection is no longer seen as a reason to cry out like Paul ""what a wretched person I am"" but instead as a badge of honor that says I am open minded enough to change and satisfy every whim of my changing culture. So indoctrinated Christians have become in the ways of the world that we have forgotten God's command to repent and how offensive sin is to the very character of God!"

An Exposition of the Woman at the Well (John 4) A. 4:4 - ""I must needs go through Samaria"". 1. Jesus knew there was an appointment with destiny at Jacob's well. B. 4:6-7 - About NOON a woman came to the well and found Jesus sitting there. 1. She came at noon, possibly to avoid the other woman. 2. Jesus positioned Himself for conversation and when the opportunity presented itself Jesus took it. 3. Jesus spoke to her for the first of seven times and asked her for water ""Give me to drink"". C. 4:9 - Jesus crossed cultural barriers to bring life to a parched heart D. 4:10-15 - Jesus got right to the point and the Samaritan woman decided she wanted the water. E. 4:16 - Jesus abruptly changes the subject. Why? 1. Because before someone can become born again they must acknowledge that they are a sinner in need of the Savior. 2. They must understand that they cannot save themselves!

Jesus used everyday examples to communicate timeless truths. - He did not use Christianese (Language only Christians can understand... Words like justification, sanctification etc.) - He did not wow her with His theology - He did not try to impress her - He won her through a conversation IV. His message... A. Is your soul thirsty? 1. Thirst is used many times in the Bible to show the condition of the soul Psalms 63:1-2 1 A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah. O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is; 2 To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary. 2. The Water of Life Revelation 22:17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. 3. A living fountain that will never run dry. John 4:14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. Isaiah 12:3 Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. In Jeremiah 2 and Jeremiah 17 the Word refers to Jehovah as the ""fountain of living waters"" B. I love You regardless... (John 3:16) Song: The Love of God Verse 1 The love of God is greater far Than tongue or pen can ever tell; It goes beyond the highest star, And reaches to the lowest hell; The guilty pair, bowed down with care, God gave His Son to win; His erring child He reconciled, And pardoned from his sin. Refrain: Oh, love of God, how rich and pure!"
1 Kings 12:26-30,"('Revival', 'The Horns Of The Alter')",Pentecostal," Intro: I live in Wichita, Kansas and this past week the weather has been extreme but the reason I say this is because for the past two years I have lived in the most southern tip of Louisiana where the cold winter months it only gets down at night into the 40's and rarely in the upper 30s. But I am in Wichita, Kansas now and in praying about this message a memory came to me of when I pastored a little church in Cedar Vale, Kansas, not far from here and a story that was told me by a dairy farmer that was in my church. He told me once on a cold winter day that during blizzards the snow would get so high and the visibility would get so low that they would have to tie a line from the top of the doorpost of the door of the barn to the top doorpost of their back door of the house so that during the night when they had to get up to milk the cows and it was storming or they were in a blizzard they could grab hold of the line and walk out to the bard without getting lost. Now for a city guy I never thought of that when it came to walking outdoors in a winter storm, but that's what Bro. Helpingstine told me. It seems different to me that I would have to hold onto to a line to lead me where I need to go, but without it I could lose my way and wonder off and freeze. "" The world is full of troubles today, but thank God I have a life line who is Jesus Christ "" The life people live today is so much different than those who lived long ago but the truths are the same, we need a lifeline and that is Jesus Christ. "" When we see God's people in the Old Testament we see a mirror of ourselves for they were only humans much like us. In the Old testament there is a story found in 1 Kings 12:26-30 It's a story that took place during Amos's day, Amos was a prophet of God. It says the Israelites had lost their way or backslid and had erected altars to false gods. Now what is so interesting is that the alters that they erected to the pagan God's were like the alters they erected for the one and true God. It shows a time in the history of Israel that they were lost and forgot their way back to what was right and sound in their life. They lost their since of compass spiritually and lifeline that would led them in the right way. These two types of alters that they had built was very similar in design and shape. They were alters that were used for worship and were similar in appearance but they were built for very different reasons, one for the worship of God and the other for the appeasement and worship of pagan deities. And God spoke through the prophets and said to the people of Israel Illus: When I was pastoring down in Texas I was involved in the Royal Rangers group and one year we decided to enter into a contest of making our own boat and racing it in the lake. Sounds good fun and cool right? So we entered but there was only one catch. The boat had to be built with cardboard. And it had to be able to hold a person or people who could paddle it to through the victory crossing lane. A cardboard boat! We make one and it really looked like a real boat. We painted it and designed it well and it was strong, or as we thought it was strong. It looked like the real deal. As with all the other boats we put ours in the water. So far so good!"
Psalms 85:1-13,"('Revival', 'Revive Me')",Methodist," Revive Us - Psalm 85 Introduction: This psalm is written after returning from Babylon and yet established as a nation. It is believed that Psalm 137 was preceded to it. This is the second Psalm of Prayer. 85:01-03 Gracious six acts of God This passage express the thanks of the people for their return from captivity. Poet sings of the Lord's former mercies and begs him to remember his people. There are six gracious acts of God, as: 1. The divine favor exhibited by God Loves to the nation 2. The fortunes are restored by revising the judgment 3. He forgave their wickedness 4. He covered their sins 5. Taken away his wrath 6. Turned himself from anger to compassion The divine favor was shone upon them as rays. He became their glory, their strength and he exalted their horns(89:17). Yahweh longs to be gracious and wanted to show favour, he rises to be compassionate(Is.30:18). So he brought help from unknown faces and unknown people(Is.60:10). The lord is delighted in you, you are Hephzibah and Beulah(Is.62:4). HE wiped out your tears, no more cries(Is.65:19). He will plant them in their land with whole heartedly(Jer. 32:41). You are sons of the living God to get the favour of God as Jesus was on the earth(Hos.1:10 & Lk. 3:22) 85:04-07 Seven requests to the Gracious God The second passage was talking about the seven prayer requests from the people for reformation and revivals. Their earnest prayer was for their own reformation; the pleads were: 1. Turn us 2. Cease your anger 3. Grace to our generations 4. Revive us 5. Makes us to rejoice 6. Show us your mercy 7. Grant us your salvation Revive us and restore us o Lord was the prayer of the Psalmist. Grant me thy willing spirit (Ps.51:12). Make your face to shine upon us (Ps.80:7). Pour out your holy spirit upon us to make us fertile(Is.32:15). Renew your miracles, performances, acts in our days and in our own times(Hab.3:2). Revive us to worship your name and bow before you alone(Ps.80:18). Revive us through thy word(119:25,40,50,88,149). Revive us for your name sake(143:11). Oh son of God revive us according to your will(Jn.5:21). The spirit of God revives(Jn.6:63). 85:08-13 Eight fold confidence in God This passage contains the words of the High priest, with God's Gracious answer; which answer is followed by the grateful acclamation of the people, to the end of the Psalm. He publishes joyfully the tidings of future good as: 1. He will speak I will receive 2. Surely Salvation is nigh 3. Mercy and truth joins 4. Righteousness and Peace kisses 5. Truth will spring forth 6. Righteousness shall work out 7. Good will begin 8. Steps for all The spiritual receptivity is very important. I will listen and bring 100 fold blessings as good soil(Mt.13:23). Martha opened her home and Mary sat under the feet of Jesus to receive the word(Luke.10:38,39). The people accepted the message of the word of repentance so salvation came to thousands(Ac.2:41). The listening and searching the word of God will make you noble and blessed(Ac.17:11). How do you accept the preaching by any Godly man is it His word or the Word of the Lord(I The. 2:13). The spiritual receptivity brings spiritual abundance and the fulfillment of the promises. The spiritual awakening will lead to social justice, social peace. It will lead to right things and right ways. Conclusion: The favor of God leads to see ourselves and plead to God for revival. The spiritual receptivity leads to prosperity of Individual and the nations."
Matthew 18:12-16,"('Zacchaeus', 'Value Of Man')",Presbyterian/Reformed," The importance of one You matter. One to the power of two Ever been in a huge crowd - like at a rugby game or at some huge event. One feeling you get in such a crowd is the littleness of who you are and your own personal insignificance. Your sense of importance diminishes even more if you realise that almost every thing that you do someone else in the world can do better. But one thing that no-one can do is occupy the life that you occupy and liv e in the moments that are uniquely allotted to you. Without God of course it does all become meaningless in fact Mate Frankovich a retired Auckland District Coroner with 16 years experience and a reputation for speaking his mind on the factors he sees contributing to suicide. ""Fear of God, the Last Judgement and spending eternity in Hell, were major deterrents to suicide. That religious belief has largely gone, to be replaced in a secular society by nihilistic attitudes - there is nothing (else) out there and nothing matters."" ""This loss of a sense of personal worth and meaning to life, is a critical factor. I tend to agree with Rick Stevenson of Project Hope that kids need to be given a sense of purpose and meaning."" ""You are really not supposed to mention any moral or religious dimension to suicide. I received an official unsigned letter from someone in the Ministry of Justice, saying: 'Don't foist your religious views on the public.' Whereas from an empirical point of view I am saying that if you indulge in a certain course of conduct, death will follow. A religious person would say that wages of sin is death."" The truth is God matters and indeed you matter. Some people ask if others believe in God like it was some theory or otion or something - well of course that would be stupid. God exists. Because he exists and this world belongs to him then God is incredibly important. As the Psalmists says - The earth and everything in it belongs to the Lord. Having established that God is who he says he is then the matter of you and me as individuals is put into a new perspective. The bible has a lot to say about who you are and why you are important despite the teeming millions and billions of people on earth right now. It is the worth and indeed the importance of you and me as individuals that I felt to address this morning. Firstly you are incredibly important to God. Matthew chapter 18 12 ""What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off? 13 And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off. 14 In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish. The importance of this passage can not be overstated. Here Jesus uses the image of a middle eastern farmer to signify our importance.

They could follow their track for miles; and they would brave the cliffs and the precipice to bring them back."
Ezekiel 37:1-16,"('Hope', 'Renewal')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Ezekiel 37 (NIV) The Valley of Dry Bones 37 The hand of the LORD was on me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the LORD and set me in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones. 2 He led me back and forth among them, and I saw a great many bones on the floor of the valley, bones that were very dry. 3 He asked me, ""Son of man, can these bones live?"" I said, ""Sovereign LORD, you alone know."" 4 Then he said to me, ""Prophesy to these bones and say to them, 'Dry bones, hear the word of the LORD! 5 This is what the Sovereign LORD says to these bones: I will make breath[a] enter you, and you will come to life. 6 I will attach tendons to you and make flesh come upon you and cover you with skin; I will put breath in you, and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the LORD.'"" 7 So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I was prophesying, there was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to bone. 8 I looked, and tendons and flesh appeared on them and skin covered them, but there was no breath in them. 9 Then he said to me, ""Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say to it, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Come, breath, from the four winds and breathe into these slain, that they may live.'"" 10 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and breath entered them; they came to life and stood up on their feet--a vast army. 11 Then he said to me: ""Son of man, these bones are the people of Israel. They say, 'Our bones are dried up and our hope is gone; we are cut off.' 12 Therefore prophesy and say to them: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: My people, I am going to open your graves and bring you up from them; I will bring you back to the land of Israel.13 Then you, my people, will know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves and bring you up from them. 14 I will put my Spirit in you and you will live, and I will settle you in your own land. Then you will know that I the LORD have spoken, and I have done it, declares the LORD.'"" . Ezekiel was a prophet and a young one at that. He was full of the word of God at a very difficult time in his nations history. His nation was in exile and it was as if they were dead and buried. Gone for all money. Exekiel and his contemporary Jeremiah had warned the nation - they had refused to listen and here they were in exile - a nation shattered and scattered beyond it seems redemption - In our current era we have watched the brutalisation of Aleppo in Syria it's largest city 'Everything is a nightmare' Before the conflict started to unfurl in July 2011, Syria had been a popular tourist destination, with ancient Aleppo as its jewel. Now it is a brutalised ruin - not totally destroyed but a mess. Imagine if you can Israel in the times of Ezekial - due to it's rebellion against God it was devastated and wrecked - the People were taken into captivity it was reduced to be seen as a valley of dry bones. When devastation is complete there can seem to be no hope and history is scattered with dead and buried civilisations. Israel was now in that situation dead and buried."
Mark 8:34-38,"('Discipleship', 'Follow Christ', 'Ashamed', 'Cost Of Discipleship')",Baptist," Losing to Win Mark 8:34-38 Rev. Brian Bill January 21-22, 2016 Video: ""Me Church"" In contrast to the common thinking that life is all about you and me, listen to the words of Christ found in Mark 8:34-38: ""And calling the crowd to him with his disciples, he said to them, 'If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it. For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul? For what can a man give in return for his soul? For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.'"" As I meditated on these words this week my mind went to something Dietrich Bonhoeffer said in his book, The Cost of Discipleship, which I first read as a brand new believer: ""Salvation is free, but discipleship will cost you your life."" As we unpack this passage, we'll begin by considering the call to follow Jesus, we'll then camp on four conditions Christ gave if we're serious about following Him and we'll conclude with three cautions. One Call We see Jesus' call in verse 34: ""And calling the crowd to him with his disciples..."" Let's set the context. Two weeks ago we focused on three questions from the previous passage in Mark 8:27-33: "" Who do people say Jesus is? "" Who do you say Jesus is? "" Who does Jesus say He is? Jesus made it very clear that He ""must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again."" After this intense teaching time, which included a public rebuke of Peter, Jesus then called the crowd and his disciples together. This word ""call"" means, ""to call to oneself, to summon hither, to bid to come."" He's calling them to huddle up because he has something very important He wants them to know. After describing His fate, He describes what it means to follow Him. Four Conditions The call is to everyone but there are also conditions to following Christ. We see this in the use of the word, ""if."" We're going to discover that the demands of discipleship can't be dismissed or downplayed. 1. Desire. The first condition is that a person must have a desire to become a disciple - ""If anyone would come after me..."" The heart of the matter is a matter of the heart. The phrase, ""would come"" is the idea of intentionality and involves the will. In order to walk with Jesus you must first want to walk with Jesus. The New King James renders it like this: ""Whoever desires to come after me."" The New American Standard puts it like this: ""If anyone wishes..."" And the New Living Translation says this: ""If any of you wants to be my follower..."" I love that the call of Jesus goes out to everyone and to anyone - to the curious crowd (those nearby), to the committed core (the eleven) and even to the counterfeit (Judas). It strikes me that these three groups are still present today. Some of you are curious about Christ, others of you are committed to Him and a few have a counterfeit faith. Notice that Jesus is about to give the same message to each of the groups as He calls everyone to Him."
"Hebrews 10:19-25, Hebrews 12:18-29","('Unity', 'Church Attendance', 'Corporate Worship', 'Family And Faith')",Assembly Of God,ebrews 10:19-," Drawing Near CCCAG January 22nd, 2017 I want to take a journey through time- We are going to go back in time 3300 years-it's about 1300 BC and the largest worship gathering ever is about to take place. 6 Million people have met in the desert to worship God. They are camped near a mountain in the southern part of what is today the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt. They strain to listen to the voice of their leader as he tells them how they should prepare for the first worship service of their fledging nation's history- Wash your clothes- put on your best robes- we are going to meet our God! Abstain from intimacy- You need to be focused on worship Do not draw too close to the mountain- God Himself is going to come down. The people did as Moses commanded- they washed their clothes, put on their finest robes. Husband and wife slept in separate beds, and they stayed within the camp as ordered. They all gathered for church, and suddenly the mountain burned with fire, loud noise proclaimed the greatness of the God they came to worship. The sight was so incredible that Moses said, ""I am trembling with fear"". That would be an incredible sight- to see the mountain filled with fire and the angelic choir singing as God descends. Israel with all of these incredible experiences, and in all of the favor it had with God never knew Him as we do. They knew God as judge, as creator, as almighty, and as Holy. They never knew Him as Father. They knew what it was to fear God, but never really understood God's love. That is because God's love, mercy, and grace are the most frequent targets of the enemy. The enemy wants God portrayed in our minds as unloving, as distant, and a vengeful malevolent dictator that only wants to make our lives miserable. But that is not the God we serve. Today we are going to explore this topic, and tie it into the importance of frequently coming together with your church family to worship. We are going to study Heb 10:19-25 Hebrews 10:19-25 Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body, and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful. And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another--and all the more as you see the Day approaching. Prayer Interrogative- How do we draw near to God, and why is it important to do so in community versus doing it Lone Ranger style. Today we are going to start by looking at the way the Old Testament believer in God worshipped I. The Former Way OT System People would gather several time a year for various feasts and ceremonies and celebrations that served to remind them of God's goodness and faithfulness to them and their ancestors."
Revelation 8:13,"('Angels', 'Book Of Revelation', 'Voices Of The Trumpet')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 4-27-2016 Series: Verse By Verse Through Revelation Title: Three-Fold Woe Announced (8:13) Revelation 8:13 (KJV) 13 And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound! Introduction Here we have one of the pauses in the narrative which the Revelation uses so effectively. Three fearful woes are to come upon the earth when the remaining three angels sound the last blasts on the trumpets; but for the moment there is a pause; a pause that provides a transition from the fourth trumpet blasts that caused havoc on nature to the three coming blasts that would let loose the Heavenly forces to attack people on the earth. Commentary ""And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven."" Notice: John says, ""I beheld . . . I heard."" Both the eye and ear are engaged, signifying the careful attention and interest of the beloved disciple in the events which passed before him. The angel is flying through mid heaven . . . the firmament, and from there the whole world can hear his three-fold cry, and he can scan the entire earth, from its center to the most remote boundary of the universe. The triple cry of ""Woe! woe! woe!,"" announces the most horrible judgments ever announced . . . Judgments that are far beyond the imagination of man. The suffering caused by evil powers is answered by the coming of suffering upon those evil powers themselves. ""Saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!"" A ""woe"" in Biblical tradition is a prophetic pronouncement of the coming judgment of God, a form also used by Jesus in the Gospels (Isaiah 3:9, 11; Jeremiah 23:1; Ezekiel 24:6, 9; Matthew 11:21; 18:7; 23:13, 15, 16, 23, 25, 27, 29; Matthew 11:21; 18:7; 23:13, 15, 16, 23, 25, 27, 29; Luke 6:24-26). The fifth trumpet is the first woe (see 9:12); the sixth trumpet is the second woe (see 11:14); the third woe is not specified, but see 12:12. The ""woes"" are to fall especially upon those who have their settled place of abode on the earth. Those who refuse to hear the solemn warnings from Heaven and in spite of all the announcements of judgment cling but to this earth as their home and their dwelling place, as if they would abide here forever. Such people are alive today. The term ""inhabiters of the earth"" is used twice before, in chapters 3:10 and 6:10, referring to the peoples upon whom the Tribulation will come, and having to do with the Philadelphia believers and the souls under the altar. The souls under the altar were comforted by being assured that the inhabiters of earth would be judged when their brethren had been killed (during the last three and one-half years of the Tribulation)."
1 Corinthians 1:10-17,"('Unity In Christ',)",Lutheran," On Friday, Donald Trump took the oath of office to become the 45th president of the United States. As you know, his election was not without controversy. After all, he lost the popular vote by 1.5 million votes! So why isn't Hillary Clinton the new president? Because Trump won the votes where they count, in the Electoral College. But since President Trump lost the popular vote, many across the U.S. have staged ""Not My President"" marches in the last couple of months. The nation to the south is divided. In our sermon text today, the Apostle Paul talks about how the congregation in Corinth was also divided. Some of the members valued Paul as their pastor. Others thought Peter was the best. Still others favored a gifted preacher named Apollos. While another group simply claimed to follow Christ. Divided loyalties in a nation like the U.S. are not surprising, but such a thing should never happen in a Christian congregation. Today Paul will explain how the Corinthians and we are a church that is fully equipped to be truly unified. Paul learned about the divisions in the Corinthian church from some members who visited him in Ephesus. These members may been part of the ""Paul"" faction. If so, they probably expected Paul to be happy to learn that he was their favorite. But the apostle wrote: ""Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized in the name of Paul?"" (1 Corinthians 1:13) Just whom had Paul gone to Corinth to promote? Himself? No. He had gone to promote Jesus, the one and only savior. It hurt Paul that the congregation was bickering over who their favorite leader was. There should have been no question: Jesus was their leader! A text like this prompts me, as your pastor, to ask the question: whose reputation am I working to promote in this congregation? My own or Christ's? Do I work hard because I want to share Jesus with all, or because I want you to say that I'm a good pastor? Don't you find a similar struggle inside of you? Why is it that you are so active in the work of this congregation? Why do you try your best at school? Why do you take parenting seriously? Why do you work the hardest at the office? Do you do these things because you are so filled with the love of Jesus that you want to serve others to the best of your ability? Or do you just want others to think highly of you? It's a little of both isn't it? And that's not surprising because Christians are simul justus et pectaor. That's a theological Latin phrase worth knowing. It means ""at the same time saint and sinner."" As a saint, you want to do your best in everything to say thank you to Jesus and to show love to others. But as a sinner you are wired to promote yourself. And it doesn't help when well-meaning people say things like, ""You're the smartest coach we've ever had,"" or ""I love working with you the best,"" or ""I wish your classmates would act more like you."" How should you react when compared like that to others? Paul was dismayed. He did not give his sinful nature a foothold lest he be filled with pride and look down on others. Oh it's not wrong to graciously thank someone for a compliment, but is there also a way you can deflect that praise to Jesus? If for example someone thanks you for helping them, you could perhaps say, ""Don't thank me, thank the one who sent me!"" Another way to deflect praise is by not drawing attention to your acts of service. Don't broadcast the fact that you were the one to do those chores around the house. And don't become resentful when no one notices. Jesus noticed, isn't that why you did the chore in the first place, to serve him?"
Leviticus 10:1-3,"('Leadership', 'Holiness Of God')",Baptist," ""Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer and put fire in it and laid incense on it and offered unauthorized fire before the Lord, which he had not commanded them. And fire came out from before the Lord and consumed them, and they died before the Lord. Then Moses said to Aaron, 'This is what the Lord has said: ""Among those who are near me I will be sanctified, and before all the people I will be glorified.""' And Aaron held his peace."" [1] Scripture warns believers, ""[Divine judgements against God's people] took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as they did"" [1 CORINTHIANS 10:6]. Again, the Word of God reminds followers of the Christ, ""These things [judgements against the community of faith] happened to them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction, on whom the end of the ages has come"" [1 CORINTHIANS 10:11]. We ignore the accounts of those who preceded us in the worship of the Living God at our own peril. Even the presumptuous sin of professed worshippers can be instructive for the people of God. Many people imagine the church of the Living God to be a democracy. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The attitude, prevalent among a surprising number of the churches of our Lord, is not new. The idea that the congregation of the faithful shows itself from earliest days of the faithful, the idea that pastors, or even deacons, can be elected without giving thought to God's work in the lives of individuals, inevitably leads to disaster. Worse still are individuals who presume against God and against His people, promoting themselves into positions of leadership, who are then allowed to occupy those positions through the silence of the people. Whenever a congregation forgets, or worse still, ignores the fact, that God appoints whom He wills to oversee the work of His people, it leads inevitably to disaster. Nadab and Abihu are the names of brothers that shall live in infamy for all the days of mankind on the earth. Born to great privilege as servants of the Living God, they reached for more, leading to death. Though He is patient, God does not play games with rebels. Let the people of God hear the Word of the Living God and take heed. SEEDS OF REBELLION -- Rebellion doesn't just happen. Long before the rebel's acts, the plot was formulated in the heart. People do not just ""fall into"" sin; the heart of disposed to sin before ever the individual sins. A willingness to sin always precedes the sinful act. Let me explain what I mean by looking at three areas of concern. Sin in the individual is the area I will first consider. We are born in sin, according to the Word [see PSALM 51:5]. We go astray from our youth as the ""self"" demands first place. Children must be trained to think of others, learning to treat their fellow beings with respect. Even as children, we know there is a God, but we seldom know our responsibilities toward God unless we are instructed. This is a vital reason why parents must train their children in foundational truth as presented in the Word of God. There is a need for instruction in righteousness as parents take their children to the House of God rather than merely sending their children to church."

But often they close their mouths and you get a crash landing! "" i.e. They had plates with pictures on, and they encouraged the kids to eat up their food; "" So that they could see the pictures on their plates. "" Whatever trick the teachers tried, it failed! "" The children would not eat their food. "" And every meal time nearly all the food was thrown away. "" Until one day, a little boy called Timothy came, "" Now Timothy was only very small and very quiet, "" And no-one took much notice of him until dinnertime.

Philippians 3:13,"('Obedience', 'Race', 'Run The Race')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," A Starter Or A Finisher Scriptures: Genesis 19:17,24-26; Philippians 3:13; Matthew 24:5-13 Two weeks ago, before the ice storm last week, I told you that I was pressing on. I was pressing on regardless of my past failures and missed opportunities. I told you that once Jesus laid a hold on me I held back, like a drowning man who was being saved, I was not letting go of my Savior. The title of my message this morning is ""A Starter or A Finisher"" and we will reexamine Philippians 3:13 that we discussed briefly two weeks ago. Before I go there though, I want to give you a reference point through an example so that you can visualize the overall point of the message. As many of you know I watch boxing. On March 8, 2003 heavyweight boxer Wladimir Klitschko lost a title fight against Corrie Sanders. This fight was Ring Magazine's upset fight of the year because by all counts Klitschko was the heavy favorite and should have won. At the time he had won many of his fights by early round knockouts. He was bigger, stronger and faster than Sanders and most other heavyweight boxers at the time. However, Sanders appeared to know something about Klitschko that others did not know - he was a strong starter but he could be a poor finisher. If he went toe to toe with Klitschko chances were slim that he would win the fight. However, if he let him swing away and he dodged and took minimal damage, Klitschko would tire himself out pretty quick because he was a big muscular guy. So that's what Sanders did - he let Klitschko swing away and tire himself out and then once he was tired, Sanders beat him - badly. After that fight Klitschko hired the late Emanuel Steward as his trainer and he focused on increasing Klitschko's stamina. After several months of working with Emanuel Stewart, Klitschko was undefeated in all of his fights while Stewart was alive. Klitschko was a starter, but if you got him into the late rounds, he was not a finisher. In my last message I talked about how we establish New Year resolutions and oftentimes fail to achieve them. I talked about how our past failures impact the decisions we make today about our present and our future. Our past failures motivate us to start strong but also allow us to feel okay when we do not finish what we start. This morning I want you to think about what you have going on in your life both spiritually and in the natural and ask yourself are you a starter or a finisher. Now you may think that you cannot be finisher unless you are a starter so everyone starts out as a starter. Well I would disagree. Many people plan to do something but never take the first step to do it. Being a planner with no action is not the same as starting and not finishing and that is a totally separate issue and sermon for later. As you think about you, I also want you to think about the people in your life - do you associate with people who finish what they start? Please turn to Philippians 3:13 and let's reacquaint ourselves with verse thirteen. It reads, ""Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead."" (Philippians 3:13) As I shared with you previously, Paul said that while he had not laid hold of it yet (that final prize) he willfully decided to forget what was behind and reached for what laid ahead. Remember, the word ""forgetting"" in the Greek portrayed the idea of something you should ""turn away from and forget"" or when used in the passive sense, ""something put aside, deliberately ignored, purposefully disregarded, and completely forgotten."" It denotes something that may have been true in the past but was no longer applicable today. Paul was saying that in order for him to reach forward he had to forget about what was behind. This reaching forward while forgetting what was behind is not a onetime thing, it's a continual choice that is made daily."

"" Now before we go much further; "" Let's just pause and fill in some background information. (a). "" This short book was written by 'Yo'el' (Hebrew ""Yahweh Is God.""), "" The Greek equivalent is 'Ioel', and the Latin & English is 'Joel'. "" Twelve other men in the Old Testament have this name, "" But none of them can be identified with the author of this book. "" We know almost nothing about him. "" Just the name of his father, who is identified 'Pethuel', "" And even the name of his father is not mentioned elsewhere in the OT. (b). "" He preached to the people of Judah (Southern Kingdom), "" And expressed a great deal of interest in Jerusalem. (c). "" Joel makes frequent references to Zion and the house of the Lord; "" He comments on the priests and the temple, "" (1:9, 13-14; 2:15-17, 23, 32; 3:1, 5-6, 16-17, 20-21), "" This would suggest that he probably lived not far from Jerusalem.

Exodus 32:15-20,"('Joshua', 'Moses', 'Worship', 'Afterlife', 'Party', 'Islam', 'Allah', 'Hinduism', 'Golden Calf', 'Hypocrite', 'Pluralism', 'Shiva', 'Brahma', 'Yahweh', 'Amazing Grace', 'Jehovah', 'Buddhist', 'Noise', 'Exclusive', 'Reporter', 'Iowa', 'Reincarnation', 'Peace Offering', 'Newspaper', 'Confucianism', 'Concert', 'Singing', 'Pantheon', 'Idols', 'Burnt Offering', 'Bathroom Reader', 'Communion Table', 'Inanimate ', 'Family Friendly', 'Pg Rated', 'Gregg Nydegger', 'Broken Loose', 'Schizophrenic', 'Joe Smith', 'Tina Turner', 'Des Moines', 'Cherry Sisters')",Christian/Church Of Christ," At the turn of the century, there was an Iowa singing group named the Cherry Sisters. Following one of their concerts a reporter for The Des Moines Register ran a scathing review He wrote that ""Their long skinny arms, equipped with talons at the extremities... waved frantically at the suffering audience. The mouths of their rancid features opened like caverns, and sounds like the wailing of condemned souls issued therefrom."" The sisters sued the paper for libel. The Judge asked the sisters to perform their act for him in court... and then ruled in favor of the newspaper. (Uncle John's 4th Bathroom Reader, p. 39) The Cherry sisters obviously didn't sing very well. Their concert was not a pleasant experience. Their singing was little more than mere NOISE. In our text this morning we have Moses coming back down from the Mountain. He's just been given the 10 commandments and he's only about half way down when he and Joshua hear something. We're told that ""When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, 'There is a noise of war in the camp.'"" Exodus 32:17 Now, Joshua didn't realize what was happening. He thought an enemy had fallen on the camp during the night and battle had broken out. What he didn't know that the people had grown tired of waiting for Moses. I mean Moses had been gone for more than a month and as far as they knew - he wasn't coming back!! They're frustrated They're upset. And they intend to take matters into their own hands. So they confront Aaron and they demand, 'Make us gods who shall go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.' Exodus 32:23 And once Aaron makes the idol for them we're told ""they rose up ... and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings. And the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play."" Exodus 32:6 They were making noise alright... but it wasn't the noise of war. It was the noise of a people having a GOOD time. But they weren't having a GODLY good time. They were making burnt offerings and peace offerings to a golden calf, and then they ate and drank and had themselves a PARTY. They felt they owed it to themselves after suffering in the desert for 50 days and now being abandoned by Moses for another 40. They intended to enjoy themselves. And so... they partied. And they were having a good time. But there was someone that day who was NOT having a good time. Do you know who was not having a good time? God. God was ticked. Moses hadn't been gone for a mere 40 days and these folks were already breaking the 1st commandment. Forty days earlier, God had come down on the mountain before Moses had gone up and He had spoken the Law in the hearing of all the people. And the very 1st commandment was this: ""You shall have no other gods before me. ""You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the LORD your God am a jealous God..."" Exodus 20:3-5a"
Ezra 1:1-3,"('Prophecy', 'Return', 'Exile', 'Fulfilled Prophecy')",Baptist," Welcome back. It's good to see you again. For those who were not here last week, I will introduce myself again. I am Ezra. I am, by vocation, a priest and a scribe, a record keeper. I am also a teacher of the Law. I served the Lord during the Restoration, the most exciting time in our history since the Exodus. Last week, we saw how the Exile fulfilled between eight hudred and nine hundred years of prophecy, from Leviticus to Jeremiah. Centuries of prophecy became our history. One prophecy we did not look at is in Isaiah 44. ""Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer, Who formed you from the womb... Who says of Cyrus, 'He is My shepherd, and he shall fulfill all My purpose;' saying of Jerusalem, 'She shall be built,' and of the temple, 'Your foundation shall be laid,'"" Is 44:24, 28. Josephus wrote in his ""Antiquities of the Jews"" (11:1:2) that Cyrus read this prophecy in Isaiah, naming him over a hundred years before he was born, and ""an earnest desire and ambition seized upon him to fulfill what was so written..."" Not only did he have an earnest desire and ambition to fulfill what was written, he was determined to build a temple more massive than Solomon's Temple. ""Its height shall be sixty cubits and its breadth sixty cubits, with three layers of great stones and one layer of timber,"" Ezra 6:3-4. This temple was to be twice as high and three times as wide as the first. If people fondly remembered the Solomon's Temple centuries after it was built and decades after it was destroyed, perhaps they would be more impressed with Cyrus' Temple. Last week, we saw that he allowed people to return home and take their idols with them because he wanted local people and local gods praying to his gods for his good. The Jews had no idols to return. Maybe he thought building a more massive temple would intimidate the God of Israel. Noooooooooo. Cyrus' reasons for building the temple don't matter. God gave His people a priority. Build the temple. He stirred the heart of the king to make it possible. They started well. They prepared for building. They laid the foundation. They started only to give up. They decided to add paneling to their walls before God's house even had walls. They decided it was not yet time to build the temple. God called two prophets, Haggai and Zechariah, to call the people back to work. As I wrote in my book, ""The work on the house of God that is in Jerusalem stopped, and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia... Now the prophets, Haggai and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel who was over them. Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak arose and began to rebuild the house of God that is in Jerusalem, and the prophets of God were with them, supporting them,"" Ezra 4:24; 5:1-2 Haggai was first to express God's displeasure. Notice, in particular, the date and God's choice of words in referring to the people. ""In the second year of Darius the King, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came by the hand of Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest: 'Thus says the Lord of hosts: These people say the time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the Lord.' Then the word of the Lord came by the hand of Haggai the prophet, 'Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins? Now, therefore, thus says the Lord of hosts: Consider your ways,'"" Haggai 1:1-5."
"Philippians 2:1-11, John 8:1-11","('Character', 'Imitate Christ', 'Imitation Christ')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," CATM Sermon - January 20, 2017 - The Way of Jesus # 3 ""I am Becoming Like Jesus in My Attitudes, Behaviour and Character"" John 8:1-11; Bill, a college student, was a new Christian. According to author Rebecca Manley Pippert, one Sunday he visited a church near campus. He walked in barefoot and was wearing a T-shirt and jeans. The service had already started, so he walked down the aisle looking for a seat. Finding none, he sat down cross-legged on the floor-right in front of the pulpit! The congregation became noticeably uneasy. Then, from the back of the church, an elderly deacon got up and with his cane slowly made his way to the front. Every eye followed him. The minister paused and there was total silence. As the old gentleman approached Bill, he dropped his cane and with great effort lowered himself and sat down beside him so the young man wouldn't have to worship alone. (Story by Ajai Prakash). There were few dry eyes in the congregation We're continuing today on our journey through the markers of The Way of Jesus. This series is, in part, preparation for those of us who will be attending the Way of Jesus Introductory evening on February 15 at 6 pm, here in this space. Does anyone recall the first marker? ""I have begun following Jesus and I am depending on the Spirit of Jesus for my journey"" Does anyone remember last week's marker, the second marker? ""I Am Being Sent by Jesus to Bless Others and Invite Them to Follow Him"". Today's marker, marker #3 is this: ""I am Becoming Like Jesus in My Attitudes, Behaviour and Character"" The Way of Jesus is really all about discipleship. How do you and I live as faithful disciples of Jesus? ""Discipleship is not about information but intimacy. It is following a person."" Mike Pilavachi Actual discipleship, being a student of Jesus, is quite specifically following Jesus, the person. The person Who is God. It is submitting myself to His teachings and His authority as God Who has all authority. It is understanding Him as He is. Who he is is admittedly overwhelming. He is God, the Creator of Heaven and Earth, the Maker of everything, the Lover of our souls. And He is our teacher. What kind of teacher was Jesus? Jesus was a rabbi. He was a rabbi, who like all other rabbis gathered disciples, students, around Him to teach them and to live out for them what it means to love God...And to teach them what it means to live 'on mission' - to live a life for God, for His glory and on God's mission. What is His mission, as we've discussed over the past few weeks? He was sent by God (John 3:17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him). Not to condemn the world but to save it. Because he so loved the world. 16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. And (John 20:21 As the Father has sent me, I am sending you)."" As He was sent, so He sends us. It is to live so as to bless others and to invite them to follow Jesus."
Jeremiah 32:16-27,"(""God's Sovereignty"", 'All-Sufficient God', 'God Of Surprises')",Christian/Church Of Christ," ""God's Gonna Do What He's Gonna Do!"" Jeremiah 32:16-27 David P. Nolte The poet, Cowper, said, ""God moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform."" God Himself said, ""For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways,"" declares the LORD. ""For as the heavens are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than your ways And My thoughts than your thoughts."" Isaiah 55:8-9 (NASB). The song Frank and Brenda sang says that God's ways are msterious. ""God's gonna do what He's gonna do He's always up to something new And you never know just who He's gonna use So when He calls your name my friend Find your place and jump right in If you want to be in on What God's Gonna do."" Let's consider the Bible Text and think about God doing what He's gonna do! At God's command, Jeremiah purchased apiece of property, and we read, ""Then after I had given the papers to Baruch, I prayed to the LORD: 'O Sovereign LORD! You made the heavens and earth by your strong hand and powerful arm. Nothing is too hard for you! You show unfailing love to thousands, but you also bring the consequences of one generation's sin upon the next. You are the great and powerful God, the LORD of Heaven's Armies. You have all wisdom and do great and mighty miracles. You see the conduct of all people, and you give them what they deserve. You performed miraculous signs and wonders in the land of Egypt--things still remembered to this day! And you have continued to do great miracles in Israel and all around the world. You have made your name famous to this day. You brought Israel out of Egypt with mighty signs and wonders, with a strong hand and powerful arm, and with overwhelming terror. You gave the people of Israel this land that you had promised their ancestors long before--a land flowing with milk and honey. Our ancestors came and conquered it and lived in it, but they refused to obey you or follow your word. They have not done anything you commanded. That is why you have sent this terrible disaster upon them. See how the siege ramps have been built against the city walls! Through war, famine, and disease, the city will be handed over to the Babylonians, who will conquer it. Everything has happened just as you said. And yet, O Sovereign LORD, you have told me to buy the field--paying good money for it before these witnesses--even though the city will soon be handed over to the Babylonians.' Then this message came to Jeremiah from the LORD: 'I am the LORD, the God of all the peoples of the world. Is anything too hard for me?'"" Jeremiah 32:16-27 (NLT). Consider three aspects of what God's gonna do! I. HE'S GONNA DO WHAT HE'S GONNA DO SOVEREIGNLY: A. Jeremiah called Him Sovereign Lord. 1. Sovereign Lord: He is above all other authority; unparalleled in rank. 2. He commands, we comply; He orders, we obey; He directs, we do."
James 1:25,"('Faith Action',)",Baptist," Elevate Your Liberty! James 1:25 ""But he who looks into the Perfect Law of Liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does."" (NKJV) One preacher paraphrased the text, by saying: "" The man who looks intently into the Perfect Law of Liberty (which is freedom), and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it - he will be blessed in what he does. "" When studying the Book of James, you will quickly come to realize that James' ultimate desire is for us to put our Faith in Action. "" To say it differently, James says ""Don't Speak It, Unless You Mean It."" There comes a time in your life, when what you stand for should be evident and apparent to all those that you encounter. At some point in your life, the visualization of your beliefs should shout louder than your words. (In other words; 'What is seen, should speak louder than what is said"") Growing up many of us are familiar with these says. . . . "" Don't just talk the talk, walk the walk. . . "" Practice What You Preach. . . "" Put Your Money where you mouth is. . "" Talk is Cheap . . "" Put Up or Shut Up. . . "" The Proofs in the Pudding . . . "" For all of you from Missouri, you might just say. . ""SHOW ME!"" Regardless of the saying, the over all idea is for the person to Support what you say, not just with words, but through action or evidence. In his Book, James challenges the believer to ""PUT UP OR SHUT UP"" by putting your Faith in Action. Somewhere along this life's journey a person's faith should be vividly demonstrated in all that they do. A person's faith can be likened unto one's reputation in the sense of the saying; ""One's Reputation Preceded Them"", so must one's Faith. Biblical Examples: "" The Faith of Joshua and Caleb preceded them, as they spied ""Canaan"" the Promised Land. (Numbers 13) "" Peter's Faith Preceded Him, as he met with Cornelius and other Gentile believers. (Acts 10) "" Paul's Faith Preceded Him, throughout his Missionary Journey's has he shared the Good News of Jesus Christ for more than 30 years. "" Jesus's Faith Preceded Him, from the time of His birth to his ascension, even until today. John 5:17 ""My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working."" Question: Does your Faith show up before you do? Is your faith evident in the workplace, or only on display by the symbolisms of your faith that you hang in your office, cube or general workspace? Is your faith evident in your home, or is it only represented by the over-sized family bible placed on the end table in the family room? Is your faith evident in your neighborhood, or will it be a surprise to your neighbors that you are confessed believer of God? Is your faith evident in your daily life, or does it only appear on the clothing you wear? Over the past several weeks, Pastor Smith has been Teaching and Preaching on Liberty. Today, I'd like to continue along those same thoughts as we explore the topic of ""Elevate Your Liberty"" ."
Titus 2:11-14,"('Grace', 'Salvation', 'Savior And Lord', 'Assurance In Faith')",Baptist," The Door of Opportunity Titus 2: 11-15 Today I want to begin a new series entitled: Church - A New Testament Model. As I began to pray and prepare this series, the first question I felt it necessary to answer was - how does one gain entrance into the church? Just in case there is any confusion, I am speaking of the body of Christ, those who have received the Lord in salvation. The church is not the building in which we meet, but the body of believers who gather here. So what must one do to gain entrance; where is the door of access to the church? I hope to answer that question today. We know, according to the apostle Paul that salvation is by grace through faith, not of works we perform or traditions we keep. Eph.2:8-9 - For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: [9] Not of works, lest any man should boast. Countless passages in Scripture reveal salvation being the door of entrance into the church. Jesus described Himself as the Door. John 10:9 - I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. We know that salvation is obtained by grace through faith in Jesus Christ the Door of salvation. If salvation is by grace, coming by and through the Door, Jesus Christ, God's only begotten Son, then who has access to this door? To whom is salvation made available? The passage before us deals beautifully with the fundamental doctrines of salvation by grace through faith in Christ alone as the means of salvation. I want to discuss: The Door of Opportunity. I. The Access through Grace (11) - For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men. I'm certain that most of you would agree that God's grace is nothing short of amazing. Clearly God is superior to man in every way. Isaiah 55:9- For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. Ps.145:17 - The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works. Man could never obtain the righteousness of God. All have sinned and come short of the glory of God. There is none righteous, no, not one. So, what hope does man have if he can never attain the righteousness of God? He has hope in grace! God's grace wasn't offered to a select few or a special group; it has been offered freely to all who will receive it. There has never been a soul so wicked, a heart so hard, or a mind so corrupt that Jesus couldn't save. He reached into the depths of sin to save each and every one. God's grace isn't based on our works of righteousness; it is available to whosoever will! You may think that God could never love you, that your life is too far gone, and there is no hope for you. Dear friend, nothing could be further from the truth. 2 Pet.3:9- The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. The fact is - God stands ready to fill your life with His grace today!"
Acts 2:1-4,"('Holy Spirit', 'Revival')",Assembly Of God," WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS ABOUT THE HOLY SPIRIT Acts 2:1-4 INTRODUCTION A. HUMOR: Reflecting on the recent presidential election, in the year 2000 Joe Lieberman ran for president. He was the United States Senator from Connecticut until 2013. Since he was the first potential Jew for presidential office he was given a lot of attention. He ended up running as Al Gore's Vice President. After a disappointing loss to Bush/ Cheney, Joe left the campaign trail and at long-last walked into his house. His wife greeted him with a kiss. ""Don't worry"" she said, ""in this house you'll always be vice president!"" B. NEED FOR GROWTH I want you to consider 2017 the ""YEAR OF SPIRITUAL GROWTH."" You can stay like you were in 2016, or you can make progress in your spiritual life! When you stand before God someday, don't you want Him to be pleased with your life? That won't happen by accident; you have to plan to make improvements. NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE A CHANGE! Our nation needs revival, but revival will only come when the people of God get revived! Do you WANT MORE of God in 2017 than you had in 2016? ARE YOU HUNGRY FOR GOD? Listen to David; 1. Ps. 63:1-2, ""O God, You are my God; early will I seek You; My soul thirsts for You; My flesh longs for You in a dry and thirsty land where there is no water. So I have looked for You in the sanctuary, to see Your power and Your glory."" 2. Psalm 42:1-2, ""As the deer pants after the water brooks, so pants my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?"" 3. Psalm 84:2 ""My soul longs, yes, even faints for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God."" Are we so full of the world that we have no room left for God? A.W. Tozer said, ""Revivals come only to those who want them badly enough. The problem is not to persuade God to fill us, but to want God sufficiently to permit him to do so. The average Christian is so cold and so contented with his wretched condition that there is no vacuum of desire into which the blessed Spirit can rush in satisfying fullness."" C. THE HOLY SPIRIT: KEY TO REVIVAL 1. A.W. Tozer mentioned the Holy Spirit as the key to revival. Probably many here don't have a clear understanding of Who the Spirit is. Lifeway Research has found that although 90% of American homes have at least one Bible, only 19% of ""Christians"" read the Bible every day. 2. Because of this, many Christians have misconceptions about what the Bible teaches. 27% think that Superman might be in the Bible; and 54% think The Hunger Games might be in the Bible! [Christianity Today, 7/16/15] 3. Then there's doctrinal error. 59% think the Holy Spirit is a force and not a personal Being. Why? Because they haven't read the Bible! Only 1 in 5 read the Bible! 4. So people get their ideas of what's in the Bible from the History Channel, or a certain denomination, or some family member. What's actually in the Bible would probably shock you! 5. Like the fact that EVERYONE who were Christians in the N.T. after Acts 2 were FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT and spoke with Spirit-given languages!"
"James 1:27, 1 John 2:15-16","('Religion', 'Religious', 'Polluted')",Christian/Church Of Christ," ARE YOU RELGIOUS (part three) Recap: Last week we looked at the beginning of James 1:27, ""Religion as God the Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress."" We looked at why orphans and widows and it's because these are among the most vulnerable, needy people. Also, in helping them we are help those who are not able to pay us back. Thus, we are helping with the purest of motives. James finishes it with 'in their distress'. We are to help but not just blindly help. We are to determine the legitimacy of the need. We looked at 1st Tim. 5:3-16 where Paul instructs Timothy to use discretion regarding what widows to help. Helping the poor and needy is a wonderful thing but the desire needs to be coupled with wisdom and discernment. We need to try to make a determination as to the legitimacy and severity of the need lest we spend our resources on illegitimate needs and then we don't have it for when there is a legitimate need. Also, we don't want to enable someone to continue to make poor choices or enable them to be dependent when they have the ability and the tools to be more independent but are choosing not to. James 1:27b, ""...and to keep oneself from becoming polluted by the world."" 1) What does it mean to be polluted by the world? Polluted means dirty, grimy, infected. Becoming polluted means to become impure. We were surrounded and engrossed in the world before we came to Christ. Whether it was sinful activities or simply having an unbiblical worldview, we were living in the only world we knew; the unspiritual one. Then we learned about the spiritual realm and the hereafter. We learned what God had to say about what was good and what wasn't; what was acceptable and what wasn't. We began learning about the new life as a new creation. We learned what we should not be doing and what we should be doing instead. When we became born again we began to see things in a different light. We saw through a spiritual lens; and that includes the world we live in. The ideals that were promoted, the behaviors of people, the teachings, practices and views that were held all took on a new shape and we gained a new understanding-a new perspective about it all. And where before the things we believed; the activities we were involved in were simply life as we lived it and were the acceptable practices and principles we lived by; now, through seeing things more clearly through the spiritual lens of truth, things began to take on a whole new shape; a whole new meaning. The things that were once acceptable are now unacceptable. The things that I was once oblivious to are now exposed for what they are. What was once clean is now polluted; what was once aromatic is now pungent. However, just because I have seen the light doesn't mean Satan's not going to try to snuff it out. His purpose is to get me polluted by the world all over again. And I have to be ready for him. I need to know what factors are involved and how I can prevent it from happening."
1 Corinthians 1:10-17,"('Gospel', 'Unity', 'Christian Unity')",Free Methodist," THERE SEEMS TO BE AN OBSESSION WITH CATEGORIZING AND LABELING THE VARIOUS THINGS IN OUR CULTURE. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE NFL, IT IS NOT ONLY BROKEN DOWN INTO THE AMERICAN AND NATIONAL CONFERENCES, BUT SPLIT INTO THE NORTH, EAST, SOUTH AND WEST TEAMS THAT COMPRISE OF 32 FRANCHISE TEAMS. IT IS NO DIFFERENT FOR SHIPPING, BUSINESSES, CAR MAKES, AIR LINES, MEDIA BROADCASTING. THEY ARE PROVIDE SIMILAR SERVICES, BUT COMPETE AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. THE SAME IS TRUE FOR OUR CHURCH BODY. WE MAY ALL BE CONSIDERED ""CHRISTIANS"", BUT EVEN SO, WE ARE STILL BROKEN DOWN AND CATEGORIZED INTO ""PROTESTANT"" ""ORTHODOX"" OR ""CATHOLIC"" CHRISTIANS. IF YOU ARE PROTESTANT, IT GETS EVEN MORE COMPLICATED AS WE ARE DIVIDED DOWN INTO DENOMINATIONAL TITLES, CONFERENCES, AND DIVISIONS. WE ARE ALL GIFTED AND CREATED TO WORSHIP AND SERVE GOD IN OUR OWN UNIQUE WAY. THE NEED FOR DENOMINATIONS ARE CRUCIAL IN HELPING US GATHER WITH 'LIKE-MINDED' PEOPLE WHERE WE CAN ""CONNECT"" AND COLLECTIVELY WORSHIP WITH OTHERS WHO FEEL AND EXPRESS THEMSELVES LIKE OURSELVES. HOWEVER, THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THESE ""OPPORTUNTIES"" AND ""COMMUNITIES"" SLIP OUT OF PLACE AND BECOME MORE OF A DIVISION, A HINDRANCE AND ANYTHING BUT, ""UNITED"" IN PURPOSE. WE SOMETIMES USE OUR TITLES AND ORGANIZATIONS TO JUDGE, COMPETE, OR EVEN....DARE I SAY....HATE OR DESPISE BECAUSE OF OUR DIFFERING WAYS TOWARDS SERVICE, MINISTRY AND WORSHIP? I THINK WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT FOR YEARS SOME CHURCHES HAVE BICKERED AND SLANDERED EACH OTHER OVER BELIEFS ON BAPTISM, HOLY COMMUNION, AND EVEN THEOLOGY. A LOT OF ""UGLINESS' HAS OCCURRED OVER WHAT DIVIDES US, RATHER THAN UNITING UNDER WHAT JOINS US IN CHRIST JESUS. JUST AS PAUL URGED THE CHURCH IN PHILIPI (2:5), ""IN YOUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH ONE ANOTHER, HAVE THE SAME MINDSET AS CHRIST JESUS...."" THIS IS SIMILAR TO WHAT ST. AUGUSTINE SAID, ""IN ESSENTIALS; UNITY; IN NON-ESSENTIALS; LIBERTY; IN ALL THINGS CHARITY."" IF YOU READ PAUL'S LETTERS ESPECIALLY TO PHILIPI AND THE CORINTHIANS HIS MESSAGE IS CLEAR: PREACH CHRIST! PREACH THE GOOD NEWS! IT IS ALL ABOUT...ONLY ABOUT, JESUS! DESPITE OUR VARIOUS DENOMINATIONAL UPBRINGINGS, AND DESPITE WHAT DIFFERENCES ARE WRITTEN IN OUR CHURCH ABOUT OUR DOCTRINES, CATECHISM, AND SACRAMENTS, WE CAN STILL STAND ""UNITED AND UNDIVDED"" ON ONE THING: JESUS CHRIST. I BELIEVE IT WASN'T MUCH DIFFERENT BACK IN THE TIME OF PAUL. SEVERAL CHRISTIANS WERE GETTING INTO ARGUMENTS, BREAKING RELATIONSHIPS, AND EVEN DIVIDING THEMSELVES APART FROM ONE ANOTHER NOT ONLY OVER TEACHINGS, BUT EVEN THE ""TEACHER"". I'M RIGHT! YOU'RE WRONG! OUR LEADER IS IN CHARGE! NO, OUR LEADER IS IN CHARGE! SOUND FAMILIAR? PAUL URGES ALL CHRISTIANS TO STAY UNITED IN WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT: JESUS CHRIST AND THE GOOD NEWS! ALL OTHER THINGS IN REGARDS TO TEACHINGS, BELIEFS, AND UNDERSTANDING SHOULD BE TREATED WITH RESPECT AND LOVE. WE MUST CHOOSE TO ""AGREE TO DISAGREE"" WHEN OUR UNDERSTANDINGS AND PRACTICES DIFFER GREATLY. I LIKE WHAT MATTHEW HENRY SAID ON THIS PASSAGE: HOW FAR WILL PRIDE CARRY CHRISTIANS IN OPPOSITION TO ONE ANOTHER! EVEN SO FAR AS TO SET CHRIST AND HIS OWN APOSTLES AT VARIANCE, AND MAKE THEM RIVALS AND COMPETITORS."""
2 Kings 4:1-44,"('Humility', 'Arrogance', 'Helplessness', 'Dependence On God')",Independent/Bible," Big Shots? Really? (2 Kings 4:1-44) 1. A young businessman had just started his own firm. He rented a beautiful office and had it furnished with antiques. Sitting there, he saw a man come into the outer office. Wishing to appear the hot shot, the businessman picked up the phone and started to pretend he had a big deal working. He threw huge figures around and made giant commitments. Finally, he hung up and asked the visitor, ""Can I help you?"" The man said, ""Yeah, I've come to activate your phone lines."" 2. When push comes to shove, none of us are that special. We have our place in society, and, as believers, our place in God's Kingdom. 3. But when we take our place in God's Kingdom, we can find out there is little room for arrogance. And, except for Jesus, all of God's people have struggled with it. Some people are even proud about how humble they are.

The lure of being situated and independent was the lure of Eden. Still tempts. The line between a healthy self-confidence and arrogance is fine and fluctuating. A. The wealthy WOMAN had a track record of being godly and GENEROUS. 1. She was the one in the family who took spiritual initiative, not ideal. 2. Her concern was to honor God by honoring His prophet. 3. She was rewarded for her devotion to the Lord in time, but that is not why she was generous and devoted... B. Elisha had a track record of being SUBMISSIVE to God. 1. When Elijah called him to follow him as his disciple, he forsook all to do so. 2. He took the responsibility represented by Elijah's cloak. C. Nonetheless, God determines to maintain His servants' HUMILITY (without human help). 1. This woman and her husband were RICH. 2. Elisha was the greatest prophet since MOSES and had power. God reminded them both of this lesson: No matter who we think we are, we are ultimately helpless, blubbering fools without God's backing. "" Yet Paul had to have his thorn in the flesh to keep him humble. "" Marylu and I had a rough week --one after another. "" All of our irritations put together does not equal what Shu-anna experienced. 3. God did not punish them for arrogance, but PREVENTED it instead. The more usable you are for God, the harder He works to keep you humble. He has an agenda to drain you of haughtiness, arrogance, snobbery, and pride. 4. God uses broken vessels, the despised of this world who DEPEND on Him. D. PRIDE comes in many forms, and is often a hidden defect. We tend to overlook pride in ourselves, and we are rightly cautious to avoid labeling others as arrogant, for concern that we are judging."
Ephesians 5:17-15,"('Solitude', ""God's Word"", 'Prayer And Fasting', ""God's Calling"")",Foursquare," Knowing God's Calling ""What We Need To Do"" Tonight I'd like to give some practical advice on how we can align ourselves to the will and way of God. And the reason we need to do so is because by knowing more about God's will and way will help us know more about God's calling upon our lives. Again, what I'm going to share most you already know, but timely reminders help. Again, this was the Apostle Peter's assessment as well. He said, ""For this reason I will not be negligent to remind you always of these things, though you know and are established in the present truth."" (2 Peter 1:12 NKJV) Being In God's Word To align ourselves with God's call we first need to get aligned with His word. On this journey of faith that we are called to take there's going to be times of darkness, uncertainty and doubt that only God's word will light a pathway through. The Psalmist said, ""Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path."" (Psalm 119:105 NKJV) Only God's word can cut through humanity's deceptive emotions and Satan's destructive strategies and get to the heart of the matter. This was the writer of Hebrews' assessment as well. ""For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."" (Hebrews 4:12 NKJV) The reason is because God is the one who inspired everything contained within the Bible. That's why it's called ""God's word."" It is profitable for everything we need to live an effective life. The Apostle Paul's said, ""All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work."" (2 Timothy 3:16-17 NKJV) The Apostle Paul tells us that God's word was literally breathed into the men who wrote down these words. The Apostle Peter confirmed this saying, ""Prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit."" (2 Peter 1:21 NKJV) As we're in God's word, the Holy Spirit reveals God's purpose and direction. It's like the seeing guide to a blind snow skier. A sighted skier will ski either behind or next to the blind skier shouting instructions as to what they are about to encounter, and how precede forward without a major mishap. By following these commands, the blind skier successfully navigates down the hill with all it's bumps and curves. But if they don't trust their guide or refuse to listen, thinking they know what's best, they are in for a disastrous outcome. God's word is our guide, and through the Holy Spirit guidance telling us what direction we should take as we read God's word, we'll successfully navigate this journey of spiritual transformation. But if we fail to trust God at His word, then we'll most likely find ourselves in the woods plastered to a tree. So the first thing we need to do is get ourselves aligned with God's word is to fill our hearts and minds with it, and then we'll know a little more of God's calling upon our lives."
Mark 4:35-40,"('Faith', 'Jesus', 'Troubles', 'Storms')",Evangelical Free," Let us continue to worship God by learning more from the Gospel of Mark. Open your Bibles there.... Remember that Mark was not one of the first 12 Disciples of Christ but became a useful minister with the Apostle Paul, who himself was not one of the first 12. Jesus started with 12 followers to expand the Kingdom of God on earth. Followers of followers of Christ were then called to continue the work of the Kingdom. The Kingdom of God grew through the words of Jesus Christ passed on to people with the power of God the Holy Spirit. Jesus directly taught the 12 Disciples and others including the apostle Paul. All of the New Testament authors wrote what they directly knew and learned from Jesus Christ. What we have in our hands in the New Testament are the thoughts and words of Jesus Christ! And we have noted from the Words of Jesus Christ in the beginning of Mark 4, the secret of the Kingdom of God is being given through Jesus Christ and His words! As we learn more and more from God's Word, the Kingdom of God will be more and more real in our lives and as we share Jesus Christ to others, the Kingdom of God will grow with new Believers of Christ! We still have the Bible today because God is protecting it and God is still in the business of expanding His Kingdom. How important is the Bible? The Kingdom of God will stop growing when the Bible is gone or has been so manipulated that it is no longer God's Word but man's words. We Christians today are called to be stewards of God's Word to continue the expansion of God's Kingdom! This is a promise from God! Will it happen or will we doubt? Let's learn from the last 5 verses of Mark 4.... Read along with me Mark 4:35-40...... What is the main lesson in this passage?? Jesus actually gives us a definition of faith in this passage! Let us start with what Jesus said at the beginning. If He is God, what was Jesus Christ saying in v35?? You've heard of the saying: ""Jesus said it; I believe it, that settles it!"" But if we really believe in Jesus Christ, whatever Jesus says, that settles it! Jesus said it, that settles it! We can note an application right here: A true believer of Jesus Christ will never question what Jesus says! v35: Jesus said, we'll go to the other side! And so, what did Jesus' disciples do?? The disciples followed Jesus' instructions; the disciples got on their boats and started going to other side of the lake. Wasn't that faith enough? We read that Jesus questioned their faith in the end. Faith is not just about starting to believe. Now, v36-38: Who were in the boat with Jesus?? There were many, not just one, fishermen with Jesus! Where do fishermen spend most of their time?? How big was the storm over the boats?? The storm was so bad that fishermen in the boat (who are used to the water and weather) feared for their lives! In the meantime, Jesus slept like a baby in a rocking chair! Now, besides being afraid, what else can we note from the disciples' statement when they woke up Jesus?? - They thought Jesus did not care!"
Revelation 22:7-17,"('Recompense', 'Eternal Rewards', ""Jesus' Second Coming"")",Baptist," ""The Final Chapter"" Revelation 22:12 Revelation 22:7 Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book. 8 And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things. 9 Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God. 10 And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand. 11 He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. 12 And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. 13 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last. 14 Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. 15 For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie. 16 I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star. 17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. Introduction: How many of you have ever picked up a book and jumped forward to the last chapter to find out how the story ends? I hope I'm not the only one who has done this! This morning we are going to ""jump"" to the last chapter of the last book in the Bible. We are told in the first verse of chapter one the following...Revelation 1:1 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John: 2 Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. 3 Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand. John who was one of the Lord's inner circle of disciples, had been entrusted with the care and keeping of the Lord's mother, Mary, and had become an important leader in the church. He is referred to in church history as the bishop of Ephesus. John had been persecuted, some say that he had survived being boiled in oil, and was later exiled to the isle of Patmos, and that he is the only one of the disciples to die a natural death. This is confirmed for us in chapter 1 verses 9-10... Revelation 1:9 I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. 10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,"
John 6:1-21,"('Feeding 5000', 'Signs', 'Feeding Of The 5000')",Anglican," Sermon by Rev George Hemmings I want to start this morning with a quick quiz. What do these signs mean? The first is easy. What about this one? Easy again. The great thing about signs is that they're universal. No matter where you are you know what this sign is telling you. Signs are all around us. They help direct us, they tell us where to go, or what to do. They communicate important things quickly, like be careful, this is hot and if you touch it you'll get burnt. Or this floor is very wet and you might slip over! It's important that we pay attention to signs because they often tell us what we need to know. John's gospel is full of signs. Not signs on posts, but rather in the form of Jesus' actions, and words. John doesn't use the language of miracles, or wonders, because he wants us to understand that these things point beyond themselves. They're signs of God's kingdom. It's just as important that we pay attention to them, and that we understand them properly. As we pick up the story in chapter 6, we read that the crowds are following Jesus on account of the signs that he's been performing. The words John uses are continuous, they'd kept following, because they kept seeing the amazing things that Jesus kept doing. In verse 2, John specifies it's on account of the signs that Jesus was doing for the sick. We've skipped over a bit since last week's encounter with the Samaritan woman at the well. But if you turn back to the end of chapter 4, we read heals a royal official's son. Then in chapter 5, while back in Jerusalem he heals a man who's been sick for over thirty-eight years! As incredible as these things are, they might not warrant a huge crowd following Jesus into the wilderness. But as John writes at the end of his gospel; Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book. John 20:30 John's just picked the highlights. The two healing signs that are in chapters 4 & 5 are just a small sample of the incredible things Jesus's been doing for the sick. It's on account of these signs that the crowds are following him. Now, sometime after this, Jesus takes his disciples off to the Sea of Galilee. It's an area many of them would have been familiar with. Jesus takes them up one of the mountains and sits down with them. In the other gospels we read that Jesus took them there to escape from the crowds. They needed to be debriefed on all that had been going on, and to get some good old fashioned R&R! But no sooner has Jesus sat down with his disciples than he looks up and sees the great crowd that's been following them! In Mark's account, we're told that Jesus saw the crowds were like a sheep without a shepherd and he had great compassion for them, and he began to teach them many things. John tells us that Jesus' compassion was also for their immediate physical needs. He looks out at the crowd, and even while they're still gathering around he's concerned for them. He turns to Phillip and asks;"
John 6:22-71,"('Atheism', 'Belief In Christ', 'The Bread Of Life')",Anglican," You may have noticed that there's been a significant revival of Atheism over the past few years. More and more people have begun to question the validity of the claims of religions, particularly Christianity, of a supernatural power being at work in the world. It's like carbon in the atmosphere. If you can't see it, it can't be there. Or so they say. Certainly the claims of Christianity that Jesus was God's own son, born in human flesh; that Jesus died then came back to life; that he could walk through locked doors; they must surely be the inventions of his followers after the fact. Yet we Christians firmly believe that what we read in God's word is true. We have a deep inner conviction that the Christian message is the truth. So why is that? Are we so simple that we'll believe anything? Well no, most Christians are reasonably intelligent, rational, thinking people. So why is it that some people believe and some don'? I think that's a question that Jesus addresses here in John chapter 6. A Why do unbelievers not believe? 1. It's a Spiritual Message. ""Jesus answered them, ""Very truly, I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves. 27Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you."""" (John 6:26-27 NRSV) Last week we read about the feeding of the 5000 and we saw the significance of that sign in terms of Jesus role as the new Moses, that is, the new saviour of the people. Some of the people recognised what Jesus did for what it was, but their conclusion wasn't quite right. They saw the miracle of bread appearing from nowhere and thought they were on to a good thing. If he could do that then he could feed an army that could drive out the Romans. But Jesus says, you've got it all wrong. There are two sorts of food. There's the bread that nourishes our physical existence, but that's doomed to perish in the end, but there's also bread that nourishes our spiritual existence which will last forever. He says: ""Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures for eternal life."" These people were materialists. They'd eaten the loaves and had their fill, but they'd completely missed the spiritual significance of what had happened. They'd seen the miracle but they hadn't seen the sign. Jesus had looked at the crowd and seen not just hungry people, but also people searching in vain for something to fill a spiritual vacuum within them. These people weren't much different from people today - like sheep without a shepherd is how Mark describes them in his account. Jesus feeds them as a sign, or a pointer to the deeper spiritual truth that he has food for us that will satisfy our spiritual hunger, a food, he says, that will endure for eternal life. The difficulty so many people have today is that they're materialists just like these Galileans and all they can see is their material needs. They're working so hard that they don't have time to sit down and think about their spiritual needs; about the fact that they need food that endures for eternal life, which the Son of Man can give them."
James 1:5-8,"('Faith', 'Wisdom', 'Pressure', 'Godly Wisdom', 'Bona Fide')",Baptist," Bona Fide A study of James Genuine Christian Living Part 3 ""The Jake Spoon Syndrome"" James 1:5-8 If you need wisdom, ask our generous God, and he will give it to you. He will not rebuke you for asking. 6 But when you ask him, be sure that your faith is in God alone. Do not waver, for a person with divided loyalty is as unsettled as a wave of the sea that is blown and tossed by the wind. 7 Such people should not expect to receive anything from the Lord. 8 Their loyalty is divided between God and the world, and they are unstable in everything they do. As we continue our series through he book of James this morning We come to a passage of scripture that I have spent quite a bit of time Studying Reading Contemplating And asking God for guidance to fully understand James moves from the topic of overcoming pressure As we studied last week To the topic of wisdom And then quickly to a topic that if we move to quickly does not seem to fit here But as we slow down And Read James in context Connecting the dots We will see that it all ties in together To show us how to live the Bona Fide Christian Life Last week we spent the entire time I am blessed to get to spend with you talking about trials Temptations Wrecks Storms What we referred to as pressure And we began looking at several ways that the Bona Fide Believer Those who look at trouble as a chance to grow As a chance to walk closer to God A Joy- James says Stand a much better chance at withstanding the pressure The bend test And developing endurance Perseverance Truly finding that joy that we all should be seeking So verse 8 gives us yet another tool for becoming Wisdom We know that there are two types of wisdom In this world God's wisdom And the worlds To become Bona Fide we must trust in God's wisdom As anything else will fail us when we need it most You may have heard me or maybe someone else say this before But Listen God always answers prayer He says Yes- No - or wait But did you know that there are two prayers that he always answers yes to? The first is the prayer of salvation God says all who call on the name of Jesus will be saved When someone comes to God with a truly repentant heart And cries out for salvation Places their faith and trust in Jesus for that salvation God willingly Joyfully Says in cowboy terms Here you go! The other is Wisdom Look back at verse 5 with me James 1:5 ""If you need wisdom, ask our generous God, and he will give it to you. He will not rebuke you for asking."" If you need wisdom Not the worlds messed up idea of wisdom But true life changing wisdom Ask God And he WILL Give it to you James Goes on to say he will not rebuke you for asking You ever ask someone for something Or ask them a question And you get what you wanted Or the answer you wanted But they made you feel like an idiot for asking? James says God does not do it like that He says to ask and he will give it without reproach- without correction Without rebuking you In simple terms without making you feel stupid for asking So like I said"
John 7:1-52,"('Feast Of Tabernacles', 'Jesus The Messiah')",Anglican," You probably won't be surprised to discover that there's a link between this chapter and the previous one. Last week we saw how some people find it hard to believe in Jesus, because faith is a spiritual activity and they're basically materialists, or because they don't accept the possibility of supernatural forces in our world, or because the idea of Jesus the Son of God dying on our behalf is too hard to believe. Well this week we continue to think about the question of belief or unbelief. Here we find a series of people who observe Jesus' behaviour, who speak with him or listen to him and who apply their own standards of judgement to him and get differing answers to the question ""who is Jesus?"". Jesus' Brothers The first group are his younger brothers. They appear in Mark's gospel wanting to take Jesus away to look after him because he's not looking after himself. But here they're with him in Galilee just before the feast of Tabernacles and they wonder why he isn't getting ready to go. Jerusalem at the feast of Tabernacles was the biggest gig of the year - a bit like being in New York on New Year's Eve. Everyone who could would be there. It was the great harvest festival for the Jews. His brothers don't believe in him as the Son of God at this stage. He's just their famous big brother. But they want him to go to Jerusalem to show people that he's still got that magic touch. If you remember, at the end of the last chapter people started moving away from Jesus because they didn't like him talking about them eating his flesh. So they encourage him to go up and show the people there his power. You can see their unbelief in their mistaken idea that he wants to be famous. In fact the opposite is true. He could go up in public and they probably would have welcomed him the way they did on Palm Sunday. But at this stage he prefers to go in secret, waiting for God's time, to appear in the temple. He also knows that at this stage the reception he'll receive from the Jewish leaders will be a negative one. He says to them: ""7The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify against it that its works are evil."" The Crowd But then there's the crowd. Here we find mixed responses. The first response is amazement. Where did he get such learning? He hasn't been taught by one of the great rabbis. Today we'd say he doesn't have a university degree; he hasn't been to theological college. So how come he knows the Scriptures so well? How come he can teach theology with such authority? What's more, they probably noticed that in his teaching he didn't constantly refer to other Rabbis the way the Pharisees did. He spoke on his own authority. ""I say unto you"", ""I tell you the truth"", etc. When asked about this he says he only teaches what God gives him. Then he gives one of the clues to believing in him: ""17Anyone who resolves to do the will of God will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own."" Jesus teaching is self-authenticating. But notice as we saw last week, that although Jesus teaches on his own authority he isn't seeking his own glory. What's more, he says, the fact that he's only seeking God's glory is part of the evidence for the genuineness of his claim (v18)."
John 8:12-59,"('Obedience', 'Son Of God', 'Children Of God')",Anglican," Sermon by Rev George Hemmings Meet Peter. He's an average, Aussie bloke. Not long after he got married, he left a career in Sydney to move to the country and raised a family. Nearly twenty years in, his marriage fell apart. After a few dark years and some soul searching, Peter emerged more compassionate, more caring, more sympathetic. You might even say wiser! He's worked hard all his life, as you might be able to tell from his face. He's either out on the farm, or in his farm supply store. He goes out of his way to ensure his customers are looked after. In fact many of them, and the people he's worked with over the years would think of him as a friend. Peter's an average Aussie bloke. You're unlikely to ever see him in the news, or read about him in the paper. But if you met him, you might think you knew him. Because Peter's my father. There's a lot of him in me. There's a lot that he's said, and done, that's shaped who I am. I see aspects of him in a lot of what I do, what I say, how I react. I wonder what your Father's like? How do your parents define you? Jesus, Son of? The question of paternity is at the heart of John chapter 8, and indeed much of John's Gospel. The question of Jesus' paternity is one that's already come up several times. Back in chapter 6, after he'd fed the five thousand, 41Then the Jews began to complain about him because he said, ""I am the bread that came down from heaven."" 42They were saying, ""Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know?"" They seem to have missed everything that Jesus has said about God being his Father. They're not ready to accept that Jesus is the unique, special, one and only, Son of God. This chapter clears up a lot about the relationship between the Father and the Son? In verse 12 of our reading today, Jesus makes another one of these outrageous claims. 12Again Jesus spoke to them, saying ""I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life."" It's another claim to be equal to God, the one who is light and life. We'll look more at this next week, when we go back to John 1 and think about the light of the world some more. It's a claim that the Jews, the Pharisees can't let go unchallenged. But rather than argue with Jesus directly the Jews question the validity of his claim. Rather than enter into another theological debate, they try a legal tactic. During the week I was introduced to a game called Resistance. The aim of the game is to discover who around the table are the spies, and who are the resistance. So of course, everyone begins saying, ""I'm Resistance."" The problem is you've only got their word for it! That's what the Jews are accusing Jesus of in verse 13. 'Then the Pharisees said to him, ""You are testifying on your own behalf; your testimony is not valid.""' As is the case today, the law of Moses required multiple witnesses to testify in capital cases. Today when you sign something you often need a witness, someone else who can verify, who can support your claims. The Jews want to know, where're Jesus' witnesses? Who can corroborate his claims? You can't just go making things up!"
John 9:1-46,"('Spiritual Blindness', 'Jesus Light Of World')",Anglican," Blindness is a terrible thing. Our sight is central to so much that we enjoy in the world. Whether it's the beauty of nature, or the smile on a other person's face when they see you coming; whether it's the control it gives you over the world around you, or the freedom that it allows you; or simply the awareness of what's going on around you, your sight is vital to you. So when someone loses their sight, it requires a lot of adjustment. They have to rely on other senses. They have to depend on others for things like simply getting around that the rest of us take for granted. If you know someone with failing eyesight you'll know what a loss it is, how many restrictions it puts on their life. But you know, there are different forms of blindness. There's physical blindness, but there's also spiritual blindness. In the story we're looking at today, we see Jesus healing a man's physical blindness, and in the process we discover the spiritual blindness of some of those looking on. Light vs darkness is one of those themes that runs through John's gospel and linked with that theme is that of judgement. If you have your Bibles open you might like to turn back to John 3:19. We'll come back to this later, but it won't hurt to have this in mind as we go through the passage before us. There in John 3:19-21 John explores the idea of light and darkness and how it's linked with the true nature of judgement. ""And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil. 20For all who do evil hate the light and do not come to the light, so that their deeds may not be exposed. 21But those who do what is true come to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in God."" (John 3:19-21 NRSV) Can you see the connection between this theme of light and darkness and blindness and seeing? It's a connection that comes out more strongly as the story unfolds. The story begins with Jesus and his disciples encountering a man who's been blind from birth. The disciples look at this man and what do they see? They don't see a man in need of healing, do they? They're blind to his pain. Rather they see an example from the Theologians Case Book! They ask ""Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"" This promises to be a really interesting discussion. Never mind the poor chap sitting there by the side of the road, let's see what Jesus thinks about the connection between sin and blindness. Well, Jesus immediately points out their own blindness. ""Neither this man nor his parents sinned; he was born blind so that God's works might be revealed in him. 4We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work. 5As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world."" Their presuppositions have blinded them first to the possibilities of the situation, and second to their purpose for being there. Their understanding of the man's blindness is in fact no different from that of the Pharisees. Their understanding of the world is one of cause and effect. Illnesses must be the result of God's judgement on sin. Whether it's the person's sin or his parents' is a matter of debate, but clearly sin must be involved."
John 10:1-42,"('Jesus', 'Jesus Died For Us', 'The Good Shepherd')",Anglican," Sermon by the Rev George Hemmings I wonder how close you've ever come to a sheep? Is it only the lamb chops that you ate yesterday on Australia day? Or have you seen one in a painting or on TV? Maybe you've touched one at a petting zoo, or a children's farm? What kind of picture do you have of sheep? I grew up on a small sheep farm in Queensland. If you've been up close and personal with sheep you'll know their fleece isn't 'white as snow', but more grey from all the dirt, burrs and ticks. They're often messy, smelly, and not particularly smart! In today's passage Jesus calls us sheep. It's not quite the compliment! But it's a good illustration, because sheep are utterly dependent on their shepherd. Being an agricultural society, sheep and shepherds were common figures in Jesus' day. Everyone listening would've been familiar with the images that Jesus describes in this chapter. What's more they would've grasped the deeper significance. Moses & David shepherds. The language of sheep and shepherds runs deep in the Old Testament. Jesus begins, not by describing the sheep or the shepherds, but by warning of another figure. It's the thief or the bandit. They have to sneak in because the sheep, and the watchmen don't know them. In ancient Israel, shepherds would bring their flocks into a pen at night. That way you only needed one person to guard them from predators or thieves. If you weren't the shepherd, the gatekeeper wouldn't let you in! So the only option you had would be to try and climb over the walls. Even if you managed to do that, I'm not sure what the plan would be next! The contrast is with the shepherd. The gatekeeper knows him and opens the gate for him. And not just the gatekeeper, the sheep know the shepherd too! I said before sheep aren't the smartest of animals. But they're smart enough to know their master. Even if someone else dressed in the shepherd's clothes, the sheep wouldn't come. And the certainly wouldn't come for a stranger! They only respond to the voice of the shepherd. It's because they know the shepherd. And he knows them. In verse 3, the shepherd calls them out by name. It's not that he stands there saying, 'Come on Sheep,' or 'Here sheepy, sheepy.' No! He knows all their names. So he calls out, 'Here Fluffy, here Blacky, here Spotty.' The shepherd knows each sheep individually. And he knows them intimately. So when he calls, they hear, they know and they respond. The sheep only follow their shepherd. So this morning I want to ask you, do you know the shepherd? Have you heard him call? Have you heard Jesus speaking? This is more than just knowing our Bibles. It's more than just knowing Sunday school stories, or being able to remember some of Jesus words. In the second half of chapter 10, the Jews, the religious leaders, come to Jesus and ask, 'How long will you keep jerking us around? Tell us plainly are you the Messiah?' What does Jesus say to them? He says, 'I've already told you.' They'd heard Jesus' teaching, they'd heard him say he was the bread of life, the water of life, the light of life. They'd heard this, but they hadn't believed. Not only had they heard Jesus words, they'd seen the signs that he'd done. If actions speak louder than words, these signs were giant shout-outs to God's kingdom, to Jesus glory. Jesus performed these signs so that we might hear, and know, that he is in the Father and the Father is in him. That is, they're so that we will know that Jesus is equal with the Father, that he's united with the Father in purpose and will. The signs are so that we'll know that Jesus is God's Son. But if we're to know Jesus the way the sheep know the shepherd, we've got to go further than this. We get an idea of the depth of the relationship we're to have with him in verse 14; 'I know my own and my own know me, just as the Father knows me and I know the Father.' It's more than an intellectual knowledge, it's a deep, intimate knowledge. It's not just about hearing his words. It's receiving, accepting, and obeying his word. It's about responding to his voice. It would be no good if the sheep in the pen heard their master's voice but then just stood there and didn't come running!"
2 Samuel 13:1-22,"('Sin', 'Salvation', 'Correction', 'Discipline')",Independent/Bible," Sin does not just affect the person who sin. It affects those around them. "" A husband who sin affects his wife and children, the child who sin hurts his parents, a pastor who sin devastates the church, a leader who sin messes up the nation... "" Sin contaminates everything around. It infects and pollutes. David might be a good king after all, but he failed miserably as a husband and a father. He had many wives and that created problems. "" Deut 17:17 - the King ""must not take many wives, or his heart will be led astray."" "" 2 Sam 12:11 - the Lord said calamity will come upon his own household. INTRODUCE CHARACTERS David has 8 wives: Michal, Ahinoam, Abigail, Maacah, Haggith, Abital, Eglah, Bathsheba. AMNON (firstborn) is the son of Ahinoam (cf 2 Sam 3:3). TAMAR is his half-ssiter, daughter of Maacah. Her full-brother is ABSALOM (third-born) JONADAB is David's brother Shimeah's son, so he is Amnon's cousin. 2 Sam 13:1-5 13:1 In the course of time, Amnon son of David fell in love with Tamar, the beautiful sister of Absalom son of David. 2 Amnon became frustrated to the point of illness on account of his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible for him to do anything to her. 3 Now Amnon had a friend named Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother. Jonadab was a very shrewd man. 4 He asked Amnon, ""Why do you, the king's son, look so haggard morning after morning? Won't you tell me?"" Amnon said to him, ""I'm in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister."" 5 ""Go to bed and pretend to be ill,"" Jonadab said. ""When your father comes to see you, say to him, `I would like my sister Tamar to come and give me something to eat. Let her prepare the food in my sight so I may watch her and then eat it from her hand.'"" JONADAB is a very shrewd man (13:3), crafty, clever but in the bad sense. "" Not only did he not dissuade him from such a sinful thought, he suggested a plan for him to get what he wants (13:3-5). 2 Sam 13:6-9 6 So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to him, ""I would like my sister Tamar to come and make some special bread in my sight, so I may eat from her hand."" 7 David sent word to Tamar at the palace: ""Go to the house of your brother Amnon and prepare some food for him."" 8 So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon, who was lying down. She took some dough, kneaded it, made the bread in his sight and baked it. It's quite obvious that David gave little attention to raising of his sons. They lived with their respective mothers and in different places. "" He did not play the role of a father in the family. He made a special visit to see his eldest son, Amnon, who pretended to be very sick. "" Bought in to the plan, he asked his father to permit Tamar to come to him. Amnon, and probably many of David's sons, are likely spoiled, being of the royal family. They get what they want and rarely denied of anything they asked for. 2 Sam 13:10-14 9 Then she took the pan and served him the bread, but he refused to eat. ""Send everyone out of here,"" Amnon said. So everyone left him. 10 Then Amnon said to Tamar, ""Bring the food here into my bedroom so I may eat from your hand."" And Tamar took the bread she had prepared and brought it to her brother Amnon in his bedroom. 11 But when she took it to him to eat, he grabbed her and said, ""Come to bed with me, my sister."""

Revelation 9:1-12,"('Bottomless Pit', 'Book Of Revelation', 'Locusts', 'Fifth Trumpet', 'First Woe')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 5-7-16 Series: Verse By Verse Through Revelation Title: Fifth Trumpet (First Woe): Locusts From the Bottomless Pit, Sent to Torment Men (Revelation 9:1-12) Revelation 9:1-12 (KJV) 1 And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit. 2 And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. 3 And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. 4 And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads. 5 And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man. 6 And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them. 7 And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men. 8 And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions. 9 And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle. 10 And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months. 11 And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon. 12 One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter. Introduction The trumpets continue to bring war, but war to which woe his added. The war to be described next is probably one of the most important in the Bible. Trumpets five and six move matters on earth along to the point where Satan's man is left undisputed master of the globe--for a season. There are three woe trumpets. The third precipitates the end and is described only after a lengthy parenthesis. At this point a description is given of just the first two. The first of these describes a satanically energized belief which afflicts humanity. The second (next lesson) describes a satanically energized battle which altars history. The description which follows is highly symbolic. It tells of a fearful demon host which is to be unleashed by divine permission. The terrible demons loosed from the pit in this manner will seize upon men and prepare them for the strong delusion and for the appointment of the beast (Antichrist) to complete and universal power. The world is already being prepared for what is to come. It is one of the ironies of the age in which we live that, at a time when scientific enlightenment is at its zenith and men are educated, practical, and materialistic in the extreme, millions are turning to the occult for entertainment, enlightenment, and eventual enslavement. Every year, hundreds of new books are published dealing with demonism, witchcraft, magic, spiritism, ghosts, and prophecy. Every season brings its quota of television shows featuring similar themes. Soothsayers, prophets, astrologers, fortune tellers are given enthusiastic hearing by millions. The groundwork is being laid for an enormous increase in demon activity soon to burst upon of the world. What will happen under the blowing of the fifth trumpet will be made easier because men have been preconditioned to reject Biblical truth and to accept the doctrine of demons."
"Matthew 13:1-23, Isaiah 14:12-17","('Kingdom Of God', 'Satan Attacks', 'Kingdom Of Heaven', 'Parables Of Jesus')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Eyes, Ears and Heart Matthew 13:1-23 NIV Last year our Sunday messages went through a series of topics on a closer walk with God that taught us how to be better disciples of Jesus. You may or may not have realized it but for 30 weeks that is what I spoke about. It was my prayer that these messages would encourage and challenge you in your faith journey as a follower of Jesus Christ. Many of those messages were about how we thought about God our Father and our relationship to Him. They also talked about our actions and behaviours as Christians and how we could learn to be more Christ-like in the things we do and say. The last section of those messages were about how to apply our thinking and our actions into our everyday living. How to be more like Jesus. This year I intend to take you on another journey with Jesus as we sit at His feet and examine the ""Parables of Jesus"". In them we'll discover what Jesus describes as ""The knowledge of the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven"". Through Jesus Parables we learn how to take what is developing within us as Christian character to the next level. We dear Saints are involved in a lifetime experience as we follow Jesus. Ours is not just a Sunday experience but an every day journey of transformation. Jesus wants to take us from what we are and turn us into what God desires us to be. Our best self if you will. Through Jesus Parables we will be given ""knowledge of the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven"" not the kingdom of this earth. The knowledge that will be imparted to us will come from the Lamb of God Himself. This knowledge is being revealed to those of you who are seekers of the deep spiritual truths of God. Last week we meet some of these seekers at the Jordan River where John the Baptist pointed out the Messiah to them. Andrew and John are just two of the seekers we will sit beside as we join Peter, Mark, Luke and Matthew and the rest of Jesus disciples. We'll join them in this journey of discovery that will open our eyes, ears and hearts to the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven. As Jesus tells us in today's parable we will receive a blessing if we open our eyes, ears and hearts to His truth. Matthew 13:16 In the Parable of the Sower Jesus unlocks the secrets for us and explains why some of us will receive this knowledge and others will not. The thing that separates peoples understanding of Jesus Parables is not the language He uses but the heart of those who are listening. Matthew 13:15 Andrew and John were seekers because they had open hearts to the things of God. They were at the Jordan River listening to John the Baptist and his message before Jesus was pointed out to them as the Lamb of God. I know today we often hear and sometimes in accusatory tones that we Christians need open minds. But listen to what the scriptures say... Matthew 6:21 New International Version (NIV) 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. Jesus words not mine. And again... Romans 10:10 New International Version (NIV) 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved."
"Nehemiah 10:39, 2 Corinthians 6:14-15","('Marriage', 'Non-Christian', 'Unequally Yoked', 'Association')",Baptist,"('rriage and association with non-believe',)"," Nehemiah 10:39, Deut. 7:1-4 Deut.7:3-4, Exodus 34:12-16, Ruth 1:16, 1 Corinthians 7:39, 1, Corinthians 7:12-14, 2 Corinthians 6:14-15 Before the words of Nehemiah 10:30-29 we had the firm agreement we talked about last week from chapter 9 verse 38 'in view of all of this - which was God's continuing providence, love, and forgiveness in the face of the repeated apostasy or denial of God by the people, in view of all of this, we are making a binding agreement, putting it in writing, and our leaders, Levites and our Priests are affixing their seals to it.' Now we see Nehemiah Firming up the law- making it more comprehensive: And he starts by dramatically insisting that men from the community should not marry foreign women, and that the community should not give their daughters to foreigners in marriage. Nehemiah expands intermarriage prohibitions from the much earlier Deuteronomy 7:3-4 and repeated in Nehemiah chapter 9 verse 8 to all the people around us, or `all the people of the land' as the NRSV reads. So he now includes Ashdodites, Ammonites, and Moabites against whom himself in chapter 4 and Ezra in chapter 9... protested against. With language such as `who do detestable things' suggesting they worship other Gods' are immoral in many ways, and eat detestable things - at least from a Jewish point of view. (Like pork and black pudding presumably). The laws given by God were viewed by the Jewish people through the lens of a people who truly believed they were chosen as God's special representatives on earth. God's chosen people- and yet in pre- exile to Babylon and during exile they had forgotten and denied God's law as found in the bible which at that time was the first five scrolls from Genesis to Deuteronomy. Now - returned to Jerusalem they affirmed their wish to obey these laws. And the first matter raised and expanded by Ezra and Nehemiah is an injunction on marrying foreigners. On the face of it a recipe for inbreeding which could lead to a higher incidence of gene disorders, structural abnormalities and inherited disease conditions, caused by harmful recessive genes. But Nehemiah and Ezra wouldn't have known about any of that- they were just following God's law as given directly to Moses from Deuteronomy--but they added to it. And the focus of Today's sermon stays with chapter 10 verse 30 ""We promise not to give our daughters in marriage to the peoples around us or take their daughters for our sons. Looking at the Old Testament and the new to answer that question for ourselves, and I doubt we will all agree. In Deuteronomy, the restriction on marriage was only against the Canaanites - God's concern for his people that the immorality of these seven nations would corrupt the Hebrews. It can be argued that the restriction would only last as long as the immorality did. Ezra's scope in Nehemiah was more universal - and hasn't lasted the test of time. Today in admittedly a recent significant change: Of the non orthodox Jewish Rabbis. The vast majority will conduct interfaith marriages, especially of those living outside Israel."
Amos 1:1-9:15,"('Amos', 'Minor Prophet')",Christian/Church Of Christ," A. Do you ever read the ""TOP TEN WORST"" lists? ILLUSTRATION: The TOP TEN WORST DRESSED at the Academy Awards. The TOP TEN WORST MOVIES of the year. The TOP TEN WORST VACATION SPOTS in America. 1. We find these LISTS somewhat AMUSING, but what if there were a ""TOP TEN WORST LIST"" of which you could POTENTIALLY be on? The TOP TEN WORST NEIGHBORS on your STREET. The TOP TEN WORST EMPLOYEES at your PLACE of WORK. . . .The TOP TEN WORST MEMBERS of Garfield Christian Church. (That list will be in the bulletin next week.) 2. Obviously, we don't want our NAMES to APPEAR on any TOP TEN WORST LIST, but imagine what it would be like to APPEAR on a LIST that God put together. a. God compiles a sort of WORST LIST of NATIONS and CITIES on which He is going to bring JUDGMENT, and He uses the prophet Amos to present that LIST. b. Now, there aren't 10 listed, but there are 8. And two of the NATIONS on that LIST are Israel and Judah. B. Amos prophesies during a time when there was much CORRUPTION among the NATIONS. 1. He prophesied around 760-750 BC. 2. Amos was a RESIDENT of the Southern Kingdom of Judah. a. He lived in the hill country of Tekoa located about 12 miles south of Jerusalem. b. The surrounding terrain was RUGGED and UNINVITING. 3. Amos' occupation was that of a SHEPHERD and care-taker of SYCAMORE trees, a type of FIG tree. COMMENT: Because of his OCCUPATION, Amos lived a RUGGED and HARD LIFE. He was not a shepherd for DOMESTIC sheep that we see in our PASTURES today, but a type of MOUNTAIN sheep that ran FREELY in the HILLS. The work of a SHEPHERD constituted that of the POOR, which undoubtedly intensified his MESSAGE against Israel for their GREED and MISTREATMENT of the POOR. 4. Amos' name means ""BURDEN-BEARER"". C. Politically, it was a GOOD TIME for Israel and Judah. 1. None of the surrounding NATIONS had sufficient STRENGTH to give them any TROUBLE. They had fortified their cities, increased their armies, and won one battle after another reaping the REWARDS of their VICTORIES. It was a time of EXPANSION, PROSPERITY, and PEACE. 2. But little did the Northern Kingdom of Israel know that within a short 30 years they would be completely annihilated and carried off into CAPTIVITY by the Assyrians--with Judah soon to follow. MESSAGE: I. JUDGEMENT AGAINST THE NATIONS- chapters 1-2 A. Amos begins his MESSAGE of DOOM- Amos 1:2 (READ) 1. Even as a LION startles his PREY with a ROAR, so does God startle the NATIONS with His voice as an ECHOING THUNDER. a. God can no longer tolerate their WICKEDNESS. b. He is the JUDGE, JURY, and EXECUTIONER. The other prophets we studied presented a message to REPENT and be SPARED, but not this time. The NATIONS have been found GUILTY and their SENTENCE has been SET--they are DOOMED. 2. Before pronouncing JUDGMENT upon Israel, God begins with her NEIGHBORS. a. Three of these, ""Damascus, Gaza, and Tyre"" were not related to Judah and Israel. b. The nations of ""Edom, Ammon, and Moab"" were. (You may recall that we discussed the sins"
Micah 1:1-7:20,"('Micah', 'Minor Prophet')",Christian/Church Of Christ," A. ""Can you HEAR me now?"" 1. That's one of those COMMERCIAL CATCH PHRASES everyone knows. ILLUSTRATION: In 2001 Verizon Wireless hired 50 people to travel the country and test the company's CELLULAR NETWORK. They each averaged 100,000 miles a year to ensure that the Verizon Network was as FAR-REACHING as they ADVERTISED. In 2002 Verizon hired thirty-four-year-old Paul Marcarelli of New York City to be the ""personification"" of those 50 testers. (And yes, those are his own glasses!) He became simply known as the ""Test Guy"" and in the Verizon commercials you would see him, on his cell phone, in a variety of places and situations testing the Verizon network uttering the phrase, ""Can you hear me now? Good!"" (As a side note: Verizon quit using Paul Marcarelli in their commercials back in 2011. And now, starring just this month, he is doing commercials for SPRINT. When Verizon quit listening, Sprint took over.) 2. ""Can you hear me now?"" is a question that God could be asking the kingdoms of Israel and Judah because they certainly haven't been listening to God. a. From Micah's writings it seems that the Northern Kingdom of Israel is either undergoing attack by the ASSYRIAN ARMY or has already been CARRIED off into CAPTIVITY. Israel was taken CAPTIVE about 722-721 BC. b. In 2 Kings 18:9-10 we learn that ""Israel was taken captive during the reign of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, and that it took 3 years for Assyria to defeat and overtake the city of Samaria, the capital of Israel."" COMMENT: God WARNED Israel time and again that this would happen unless they repented of their wickedness and idolatry and RETURN to Him, but they didn't LISTEN. While the Assyrian army is viscously ripping their NATION APART killing people by the THOUSANDS, I wonder if God is sadly asking, ""Can you hear me now, Israel?"" B. This is certainly the question that the Prophet Micah is now asking of the Southern Kingdom of Judah. 1. He uses the words ""HEAR & LISTEN"" throughout this book to stress the importance of God's Word. 2. Micah was written around 735-700 BC. a. Micah was a contemporary with Isaiah, prophesying during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. b. There is a reference of him in Jeremiah 26:18 pronouncing ""DOOM on Judah"". Micah was a resident of Judah from Moresheth-Gath, about 20-25 miles southwest of Jerusalem. He, even as Amos, was a prophet to the POOR and DOWNTRODDEN. He was especially indignant over the CORRUPTION and HEARTLESSNESS of the inhuman RULERS and money-serving PRIESTS and PROPHETS. Micah is said ""to have Amos' PASSION for JUSTICE and Hosea's HEART for LOVE."" 3. Micah's name means: ""WHO IS LIKE THE LORD"" (Yahweh) MESSAGE: I. MESSAGE CONCERNING JUDAH'S SINS (JUDGMENT)- chapters 1-3 A. Micah begins by letting his readers and listeners know that what he is about to say does not come from him, but are the ""WORDS of the LORD""- v. 1. 1. His prophecies concern the CAPITAL cities of Israel and Judah--""Samaria"" and ""Jerusalem."" a. He begins with the word ""HEAR"" in v. 2- (READ)."
Mark 6:45-52,"('Faith', 'Fear', 'Believe', 'Faith Alive')",Baptist," The Ministry, Message, and Messiah in the Book of Mark Week 14: ""Are You Fearfully Afraid or Faithfully Focused?"" (Mark 6:45-52) Crossroads Community Church Rev. Ricky A. Rohrig Sr., Founding Pastor Webster-Merriam defines fear as verb or action word meaning: "" to be afraid of (something or someone) "" to expect or worry about (something bad or unpleasant) "" to be afraid and worried At some point in your life we have all been scared or feared something. Let me ask you what are somethings that you are scared of or fearful of? One of the ways to overcome your fears is to face them head on. For some they may need a little extra encouragement and there was a show that not only made people face their fears head on, but if you were strong enough, brave enough, and maybe even crazy enough you could win $50,000 for doing it. The show was called Fear factor, hosted by comedian and UFC commentator Joe Rogan, in each pulse-racing ""Fear Factor"" episode, contestants (sometimes solo, often paired with spouses, siblings or best friends) recruited from across the nation must decide if they have the guts and determination to face their most primal fears. Under the supervision of professional Hollywood stunt coordinators, contestants are confronted with a series of challenging stunts. If they complete their task they advance; if fear stops them from completing a stunt or they fail the mission, they are immediately eliminated. The contestant who wins the final challenge takes home the prize. "" The first stunt is designed to physically test each of the contestants or teams (for example, jumping from one building to the next or hanging from a helicopter and collecting flags on a ladder). Usually, the two men and the two women, or the three teams, that gave the best performance (such as the fastest time, farthest distance, or number of flags collected in under a certain time) will move on to the second stunt. The others are eliminated. "" The second stunt is meant to mentally challenge the contestants or teams. The three most common types of stunts in the second round are eating stunts, animal stunts, and retrieval/transfer stunts. Eating stunts entail ingesting vile animal parts, live bugs, or a blended concoction of multiple items; animal stunts entail immersing one's head or entire body in animals considered to be disgusting or intimidating (such as rats, spiders, snakes, or worms); retrieval/transfer stunts entail retrieving items or gross objects (often by mouth) hidden in disgusting substances (for example, blood or lard), or live animals (such as sit in a tub of snakes as long as they could). Less often, the second stunt involves a pain endurance challenge or embarrassment tolerance challenge, such as outlasting competitors in a tear gas chamber, walking on broken glass with bare feet, getting a tattoo, having their head shaved, getting piercings or ingesting habanero peppers. With the exception of retrieval/transfer stunts, contestants are usually not eliminated after this stunt unless they did not complete it, or if vomited before finishing. In the case of teams, one team may be eliminated for performing the worst."
1 Thessalonians 1:1-6,"('Mature Christians',)",Calvary Chapel," For those of you who weren't here with us last week, we finished off the book of Daniel. "" It was a wonderful book to teach, and I hope that all of us had our faith strengthened as a result of this book. (Elaborate) "" Now this morning we're going to start the book of Thessalonians. "" And Thessalonians is a book that will help us to see the outcome of a life lived wholeheartedly unto Jesus. (Elaborate) "" Now the book of Thessalonians will also teach us about the Rapture as we'll see when we get to 1st Thessalonians Chapter 4. "" And I can't wait to teach it. "" But for this morning, let me give you an overview of what we can expect to learn about from 1st & 2nd Thessalonians. First of all we know that 1st and 2nd Thessalonians, along with Galatians were the first letters written by the Apostle Paul approximately twenty years after Jesus' Resurrection. "" So now we know when Paul wrote Thessalonians, but why did he write it? "" Well, Paul had just been delivered miraculously from a Philippian prison according to Acts 16. "" And after he was delivered Paul heads down to Thessalonica where he starts a church, appoints elders, and helps the ministry take root. "" He did all of this in the space of 3 weeks according to Acts 17:2. "" Now some may say, ""Wow! How could he get a ministry started and be an effective ministry in only three weeks?"" "" Hey, when God wants something done, he can lead a person to do it in a very short time span! (Elaborate) "" In fact, let me read you a story from Calvary Chapel Pastor Jon Courson who experienced this very thing early on in his own ministry. QUOTE: Our first youth pastor was a California-transplanted hippy who got saved and baptized at our first Bible study at Yale Creek. About two months later, he said, ""Jon, I am so thrilled with what God is showing me that I want to teach the kids."" Smelling cigarettes on his breath, I said, ""If you'll never smoke another cigarette, you can be our youth pastor."" ""Okay,"" he said. Dave stopped smoking that day and became our youth pastor. He is now pastoring a Four Square Church in Washington State."" I look back now and wonder if I was crazy to put a guy on the ministry team who looked like Charles Manson and smoked constantly. Yet Dave was, and continues to be, an example of how the Spirit of the Lord can change a person from within and blow conventionality right out the window. I'm not suggesting we put every three-week-old Christian in a position of leadership. I am saying that in certain times and places, it can happen. END QUOTE (Elaborate: We must be led of the Spirit and not by man's wisdom or customs) Now when we look back at what Paul did in Thessalonica, we see that he too was led by the Holy Spirit. "" You see, the Holy Spirit knew that Paul needed to plant and nurture this church very quickly. "" But why? Because at the end of those three weeks Paul would be driven out of Thessalonica. "" But during those amazing three weeks Paul saw people saved, discipled, and ordained for the ministry. "" Today, we too as believers should also desire and long to be led in the same way by the Spirit of God. (Elaborate)"
Proverbs 1:30-31,"('Godly', 'Counsel', 'Godly Counsel')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke, they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes. - Proverbs 1:30-31 We have all had times in our lives where believers in the Lord have given advice to us in our Christian walks. Sometimes it was a kind reminder of a verse or a practical suggestion in a situation. Other times it could even be an extreme ""Thus saith the Lord."" What do we do with such counsel we recieve in our lives? Do we accept counsel that we at first disagree with or is contrary to what we are doing or think? In my own live there were various times that I recieved godly counsel that I knew deep down in my heart was right but was against what I wanted and desired. Other times I have recieved strong words from brothers that was very extreme and in the end I needed to weigh it with other counsel and how Church history also believed on the issue. But one way we can know that counsel is sound is if it accords with the Scriptures and secondly if it is counsel that many other godly men agree with. Such counsel should be weighed carefully and it is dangerous to reject such warnings as in the end we might be fighting against God Himself. Many believers in our day are quick to give their opinions but godly Elders and leaders in the body of Christ, pray and hear from God clearly to sound a warning or help for someone. It is not dangerous to reject someone's opinion or thinking on an issue but to reject strong godly counsel from a church leader can lead to a life full of hurt and even destruction. If we cannot recieve counsel and instruction we become foolish no matter how prosperous we are in life (Ecclesiastes 4:13). We can start to hate being corrected or having counsel that goes against our thinking (Proverbs 5:12). When we reject godly counsel over time we end up rejecting the Lord Himself (Proverbs 1:25-26). We become right in our own eyes in every situation (Proverbs 12:15). C.S. Lewis says, ""There is nothing progressive about being pig headed and refusing to admit a mistake."" Be willing to admit failure, admit that your way is not always right. Admit you allowed a mistake. Such humbling of one's self will open your heart to hear godly counsel again, and allow the Lord to direct your paths. When we put pressure, control and our own reasoning upon a situation it can seem we are right but in the light of Scriptures and godly counsel the actual truth can be revealed. The warning in the verse in Proverbs is that the worse thing that can happen, is the Lord simply will allow us to be filled with the ""fruit of our ways"" and the end result of our own scheming. May God have mercy and allow us to always be willing to hear the advice of others, especially godly elders and mature believers in the Lord. Such an open heart will save us from many trials and lead us in the way of blessing with the Lord."
"1 Timothy 3:14-17, Romans 8:1-8","('Emotions', 'Trust', 'Maturity', 'Feelings', 'Christian Maturity')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Human emotions are deeply intertwined with the five basic senses of sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing, which human beings use to investigate and perceive the world around them. They are essential for processing, learning, perception, reasoning, problem-solving and adapting to the events of life, whether good or bad. Emotion is something that is experienced mentally, spiritually and physically. God is emotional about His love for us (Jn 16:27; Rev 3:9). Emotions can cause a sensory feeling or expression, such as happiness, joy, love, excitement, curiosity, anger, sorrow, fear, worry and hate. It is usually accompanied by a physiological reaction within the body. Feeling and emotions are distinguished from cognitive and volitional states of consciousness. Cognition is the mental processes of perception, memory, judgment, and reasoning. Volition is the free will to choose or make a decision. Thoughts govern the emotions which play a role in a person's behavior and how they perceive other people and the world around them. The emotions can also be a spiritual liability because feelings have their roots in the sin nature. The enemy lied to deceive Eve and appealed to her emotions of delight for good food, as well as her emotional curiosity and desire to be made ""wise,"" in order to override her submission to the command of God not to eat the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil (Gen 2:17, 3:6; 2 Cor 11:3; 1 Tim 2:14). Adam ate the forbidden fruit because his emotions could not bear the thought of being without Eve. The enemy wants to use emotions to tempt a person and lead them away from the written truth of God's Word, the Bible. ""But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work."" (1 Tim 3:14-17 ESV) The Unchanging Mind of God The Scriptures contain the unchanging mind of God, which will never fail those who put their trusting-faith in Him. Those who allow themselves to be controlled by the emotional desires of the flesh will only care for the pleasures of the flesh - but those who allow themselves to be controlled by Holy Spirit will find themselves doing the things that please God. ""For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it never did obey God's laws and it never will. That's why those who are still under control of their old sinful nature, bent on satisfying the desires of the flesh and mortal spirit cannot please God."" (Rom 8:1-8 NIV) It is only the Word of God that can deeply penetrate, sift and analyze the reflections of the heart. It separates the old fearful nature of the soul - the mind, emotions, feelings, senses, etc., from the spirit within - the realm where trusting-faith lives and grows. It is independent of the senses since it is supernatural understanding and not experience, feelings, mental conviction, enthusiasm, or something that can be touched or seen."
"Isaiah 48:16, Exodus 31:3-5","('Spirit', 'Spirit Of God', 'Spirit Of The Lord', 'Spirit Of Jehovah')",Christian/Church Of Christ," Fifty years ago many people did much of the maintenance and repair on their automobiles. Although, the basic workings of the internal combustion engine hasn't changed, with modern engineering and computer components it is much more difficult to do much to a car or truck today. That comparison has some similarity to God's Holy Spirit in the Old Testament compared to the New Testament. In the OT, God dealt directly with his people through prophets and priests and other leaders. Today, however, we have to go into the pages of God's Word to learn more about his Holy Spirit and we do not have visible evidence of His leading and guiding us. Of the thirty-nine books of the OT, twenty-three refer directly to the Holy Spirit. In the OT the Holy Spirit is mentioned using different names and titles. A few of the descriptors are; Spirit, Spirit of God, Spirit of Jehovah, Spirit of the Lord, and Holy Spirit. Of the eighty-eight distinct references to the Holy Spirit in the OT, there are 18 different names applied to him . There is nothing in the OT that gives credence to the NT theology of the Trinity and the distinct personality of the Spirit in the full NT sense. In Genesis 1:26 NASB we read, ""Then God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."" This reading implies plural personalities, but there is no clear distinction made. One would be hard-pressed to prove from OT scripture that the Spirit of God is a personality distinct from God. However, the OT does identify a distinction between God and the Holy Spirit. Psalm 139:7 NASB states, ""Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?"" God is present everywhere because God is Spirit . His presence occurs from the heights of heaven to the depths of the grave. No matter where we are, God's Spirit is there to guide us. There are multiple passages in the OT that indicate that God and the Holy Spirit are not identical beings. One poignant passage involved King David after his grievous sin with Bathsheba. Psalm 51:11 NASB reads, ""Do not cast me away from Your presence And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me."" These are the words of one who has walked with God but who knows that the relationship has been shattered. For about a year, David has lived with unforgiven sin because he has not repented of his actions and he created a gulf between himself and God. Now he hopes, by God's grace, that the barrier be removed and that he may once again be brought into the fellowship of the Lord. When Samuel the prophet had first anointed him as a youth to become the future king, ""from that day on the Spirit of the Lord came upon David in power"" . It would be frightening to know that you had been cast away from God's presence. David, the man for being known as a man after God's own heart , now feels the loneliness that comes from being away from God and His Spirit. David now experiences his own un-holiness in light of God's holiness. This account of David demonstrates that God and God's Spirit had distinct roles in his life and actions."
Mark 6:53-56,"('Healing', 'Hope', 'Help', 'Health')",Baptist," The Ministry, Message, and Messiah in the Book of Mark Week 15: ""Jesus is our Helper, Healer, and Hope."" (Mark 6:53-56) Crossroads Community Church Rev. Ricky A. Rohrig Sr., Founding Pastor Have you ever lost something before? How about your grocery list, you purse or your wallet, maybe your keys, a homework assignment or an important project fro work, maybe even at one time you lost your child momentarily, at to go one step further, maybe in the crazy chaotic world we live in, maybe sometimes it seems like you may be losing your mind. If you are all like me, whenever I lose something it is always at the most inopportune time. What about yourself being physically lost? Being in a strange place, where you're surroundings are not familiar? Of course us guys never want to admit to that we have ever been lost. If you ride with a guy driving we will just say we are ""taking the scenic route."" Funny how the scenic route always tool longer, then when you get there (however long that takes) ""the guy"" states, see I told you I knew where I was going! I believe women must have come together and said enough is enough, and they created GPS (let's call it Gals Providing Support) of course that would have never sufficed for us guys so they came up with something that sounds more manly and intellectual, Global Positioning System. Ever wonder guys why GPS is a woman's voice, starts sweet and if you don't listen and you get lost they tell you where you made a mistake, and redirect you? Sound familiar, just sayin'! Hopefully, we can all agree on is being lost is no fun. That we all at times have been, are or will be lost: "" Physically "" Mentally "" Emotionally "" Spiritually We could use the same to describe being sick: And going even one step further we have at one time or another all felt hopeless: The amazing thing is as complicated as our problems, burdens, and life becomes, the answer is found in Jesus. I don't mean knowing about Jesus through someone else, but having a personal relationship with Him! So today we are going to explore the importance of seeking Jesus for everything you need because Jesus is our Help, Healer, and Hope! If you have your Bibles our smartphones please go to Mark 6:53-56. This wraps up the 6th chapter of Mark. Last week we unpacked and answered the question, Are You Fearfully Afraid or Faithfully Focused? Jesus had just come to the disciples walking on the water in the midst of their storm, physical and spiritual. He has calmed the storm and their spirit as we pick it up today. Mark 6:53-56 53And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore. 54And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him, 55And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was. 56And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole."
Genesis 1:26-28,"('Human Life', 'Sacred Life', 'Life To Be Protected')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Creation, Sin, and More Sin The Image of God and the Value of Human Life Gen 1:26-28 David Taylor December 17, 2016 Emil Brunner said that ""the most powerful of all spiritual forces is man's view of himself, the way in which he understands his nature and his destiny; indeed it is the one force which determines all the others which influence human life. Plato pictures Socrates as a man obsessed in his quest for wisdom - namely, to know himself. But herein lies the problem for all of us, outside of divine revelation, we are incapable of knowing ourselves, our destiny, and our rightful place in the scheme of things. So let's look at what the bible say about the image of God. Human Life is Unique to all Creation The whole account of creation builds up to the creation of humanity. Humanity is the pinnacle of God's creative handiwork. You see a change in the flow of chapter one at verse twenty six, ""then, God said let us make man in our own image."" And because prose is not sufficient Moses must use poetry to show the grandeur of the subject matter. God has not said anything like this about the rest of creation. All this points to the uniqueness of humanity compared to the rest of creation. When I want to express my love and affection in an extraordinary way to Karen, I use poetry because it communicates my love more effectively than just saying it. Moses, who wrote Genesis, used poetry to describe the creation of humanity to emphasize our uniqueness over all the rest of creation. This is contrary to the well known philosopher, Peter Singer, who wrote a book in 1979 called Animal Liberation where he argued that we ought to extend to animals the same equality of consideration that we extend to humans. Yet I wonder what Singer would do if a child and their dog fell off a cliff and he was sent to rescue them. Who would he rescue first? Animals are magnificent creatures and I am frequently in awe of them. But none of them are on par with humans. My cat does not question whether attacking the shrew or vole is right or wrong. She is not even thinking about it because she is acting on instinct without any moral compass. Humanity is unique in all creation. Human Life is Sacred As we saw last week, being created in the image of God means that humanity uniquely reflects God. The stamp of the divine image means that every human life is sacred. Every human being has intrinsic value not just because of what they do or contribute but just because they are human. Remember, that word is where we get the word icon. An icon represents something else like a logo. Another metaphor to describe the divine image in humanity comes from ""St. Gregory of Nyssa, the 4th century bishop who wrote: 'The measure of what is accessible to you is in you, for thus your Maker from the start endowed your essential nature with such good. God has imprinted upon your structure replicas of the good things in his own nature, as though stamping wax with the shape of a design.' In ancient times, people signed documents by putting hot wax on the paper and pressing into the wax a seal carved with their unique design. The wax then bore the seal's imprint and showed that the document was theirs. God is like the seal, and our human nature is like the wax that shows forth the same design as God, but on a smaller scale. The wax receives the imprint by direct contact with the seal, and the copy receives its likeness to the model by direct contact with it. So God is present within his image, making it to be an image of God."" So being created in the image of God means that all human life has the thumb print of God on them so that every life sacred, even malformed life."
Judges 2:6-3:6,"('Abortion', 'Apostasy', 'Baal', 'Sanctity Of Life')",Baptist," Forgetting God It's not hard to forget the things of God. When we choose to sin, we are forgetting God. When we choose to change or underreport our income for tax purposes, we do that after we've decided to forget what God says about his care and ability to provide for his children. When we engage in sexual immoral practices (pornography, pre-martial sex, adultery, homosexuality, etc.) we first must forget what God has said and promised about purity and the sufficiency of Jesus. The action of sin is preceded by the forgetting of God, who he is, who he says you are, and what he promises his children. Or put another way: Spiritual amnesia will always lead to spiritual apostasy. The Next Generation (vv 2:6-3:6) This next section of Judges is best read as running parallel to Chapter 1 through 2:5. This is another introduction but it also keys us into patterns in the book as well. If you overlay this section with the first, you'll immediately see the source, the reason this all went south so quickly. It starts with Joshua and then moves to describe the type of faithlessness the Israelites displayed. The author is going to make clear the source of their rebellion, how they rebel, how God deals with this rebellion, and how Israel responds to God. The author here will give us five different characteristics of this infamous generation. The Generation that Forgot God (vv. 2:6-10) ""6 When Joshua dismissed the people, the people of Israel went each to his inheritance to take possession of the land. 7 And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work that the Lord had done for Israel. 8 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died at the age of 110 years. 9 And they buried him within the boundaries of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of the mountain of Gaash. 10 And all that generation also were gathered to their fathers. And there arose another generation after them who did not know the Lord or the work that he had done for Israel."" This account starts with Joshua in verse six sending the tribes to their inheritance. The people have renewed their covenant (Joshua 24) with God to obey and worship him and now they head off to take their inheritance. The verses then begin tell us a little more about Joshua's life and leadership. Apparently he was a pretty effective soldier and spiritual leader. The author notes that Israel not only served the Lord all the days of Joshua but also all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua. This was the generation that had walked across the Jordan River. This was the generation that saw the first battle one by horns and a few long walks around Jericho. Their faith was bolstered by sight and strengthened by Joshua's leadership. The author notes that he lived until he was 110 years old and he died and then other faithful generation died. This almost seems immaterial to the story - why do we care about how faithful Israel was under Joshua and why do we care that the next generation also served the Lord?"
"Luke 2:8-14, 1 Corinthians 10:31","('Christmas', 'Glory', 'Purpose', 'Image Of God', 'The Image Of God')",Baptist," ""Glory to God"" (Luke 2:8-14) And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. 9 And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear. 10 And the angel said to them, ""Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. 11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. 12 And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger."" 13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, 14""Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!"" Yesterday, pastor Yang shared a message based on the verse 10, the very first message concerning Jesus's birth: """"Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people."" And we learned from pastor Yang why it is a such a great joy that Jesus came. It was because through Jesus we can enjoy never ending friendship. Jesus also gives us the eternal life, purpose of life, and the rest we need the kind no one else can provide, among many other reasons to rejoice. For today I would like to talk about the second message concerning Jesus birth. The first message was delivered by one angel, but the second message was by the angel and a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying ""Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!"" I imagine the message was conveyed in thunder like music, most magnificent praise music. These angelic beings were proclaiming Jesus came for glory of God and peace on earth. They used antithesis to compare what happens in the highest with what happens in the earth. They didn't say peace on earth first, but Glory to God in the highest first. I believe they meant to say, peace on earth depends on our giving Glory to God in the highest. Why we don't enjoy peace on earth as much as we want? Why we don't find peace in our society, even in church and our family as much as we wish? I believe that's because we don't give glory to God while we seek our own glory. Unfortunately, according to the scriptures, our human history started with our first ancestor seeking their own glory rather than the glory of God. Even now most human being live in seeking their own glory. (I, I, I, I , I, I, I is the one to be glorified and worshiped, focused, and centered in our culture.) But, that's not how God designed and created us. God created us for His own glory. In ancient times and even today, kings and all kinds of gods want to display their glory by making their statues or idols. But, God commanded not to make any statues or idols after His image. Instead He created human being in His own image so that they as living being may display and reflect God's glory - His character, His majesty, His authority, His love etc. But, men were deceived by Satan, they chose to eat of the forbidden fruit in order to be like God, independent of him and wise in their own right. As a result they lost peace with God and they lost peace among themselves."
Philippians 1:21,"('Funeral', 'Graduation', 'Steve Jobs', 'Purpose Of Life')",Baptist," For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. Phi 1:21 On June 12, 2005, exactly today 11 years ago, Steve Jobs delivered a speech to the graduating class at Stanford University. So outstanding was his speech that many call the speech as the most memorable, best, life-changing and even legendary. And more than 24 million people viewed the speech on YouTube. Among many stories he shared in the speech, I thought one story stood out explaining why Steve Jobs was so special and so successful. Since his age 17 until the very day of the speech as 50 years old man, for the past 33 years, without missing a single day, he looked at the mirror every morning and asked himself: ""If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?"" And then whenever the answer had been ""No"" for too many days in a row, he knew he needed to change something. Isn't it amazing that he questioned to himself such question every morning for 33 years and then made decisions accordingly? Why did he keep reminding himself everyday for 33 years, ""each day could have been the last day of his life?"" This was his answer: ""Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything -- all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure -- these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important."" Simply put it, ""Live like you're dying so you may live doing what matters most"" So wise, Steve Jobs. Like Steve Jobs, the Bible also cautions us to be aware of the shortness of our lives: psalmist for example, said 'Remember how fleeting is my life' (Ps 89:47a) Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom. (ps 90:12) LORD, remind me how brief my time on earth will be. Remind me that my days are numbered--how fleeting my life is. 5 You have made my life no longer than the width of my hand. My entire lifetime is just a moment to you; at best, each of us is but a breath."" ps 39:4,5 Yet, with all the wisdom, discipline and success, he acknowledged his fear of death. He had been diagnosed as having incurable cancer, though later it turned out curable tumor and after the surgery he was fine, but, remembering the horror of having incurable cancer, he said he didn't want such experience a few more decades. He said ""No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there."" Though it sounds he even praised death as "" Life's change agent which he said clears out the old to make way for the new."" I could hear his desperate groaning ""I want to live. I don't want to die"" No one wants to die. This is why Jesus came in flesh and blood: ""Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death--that is, the devil-- 15 and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death."" 8 days ago, I was in Dallas Texas, attending my uncle's funeral service. Reminding me of the recent graduation ceremonies I attended, I thought it was like another type of graduation ceremony, namely final graduation."
"1 Corinthians 3:11, Colossians 1:16","('Local Church', 'Church Anniversary', 'Church Identity', 'Lord Of The Church', 'Church Purpose')",Baptist," ""Jesus, the Lord of the Church"" ""On this rock I will build My church; For no one can lay any other foundation than what has been laid down. That foundation is Jesus Christ."" (Matthew 16:18; 1 Corinthians 3:11) Why anniversary? It is because we want to remind ourselves of why we started and exist as the church. Why we started and exist church? The answer lies in what Jesus has to say because Jesus is the Lord of the church. We may call us as our church, but in reality this church belongs to Jesus. Jesus said, ""I will build my church', He was saying church is His. As we celebrate the anniversary, the primary factor should be to recognize, declare and confess that Jesus is the Lord of the church. And I would like to share three aspects in terms of why Jesus is the Lord of this church. First, Jesus is the Lord of the church because He is the creator of the church. ""For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him."" (Col 1:16) Bible tells us that all things were created through Him and for Him. You and I and all the people and all visible and invisible were created through Him and for Him. Unfortunately not every people recognize Him as the Creator; but the church is body of the believers who accept Jesus as the Creator. Whoever created something would know best its purpose and usage. Whoever created computer or smartphone or any other things for that matter would know best its purpose and usage. Likewise, Jesus as creator of the human being knows best why and how man exists.and why and how Church exists. According to the scriptures the church exists for Jesus and lives for Jesus. Whatever you do - as you study as student; as you work and do business; as you care and maintain as housewife - you do for Jesus. We confess Jesus as our Lord because we acknowledge we exist for Jesus and we live to please Him. It is a confession to follow His will. Let's always remember that Jesus is the Creator and the Lord of our individual life and the church. Secondly, Jesus is the Lord of the church because He is the savior of the church. The bible tells ""He is the Savior of his body, the church."" Ephesus 5:23 When God created the human being, they disobeyed God and chose to follow their own way like sheep. They turned away from God and chose to live independently from God. As a result, they were separated from God. But, God didn't give up. He sent His own Soon in human flesh so that He would die for our sins on the cross. THis is Jesus. Jesus is not only the Creator but also the Savior who died for our sins on the Cross and resurrected. The Bible calls His death on the cross as the Good News, the gospel. Why is it the Good news? While we were sinners, while we were enemies, while we were still helpless, Christ died for us ungodly, thus demonstrates the love of God. Yes, the Bible calls His death the good news because it shows how much God loves us."
"John 3:1-16, Ephesians 2:1-3","('New Life', 'Nicodemus', 'Sinner', 'Born Again')",Baptist," The Beginning of the New Life - the New Life (John 3:1-16) 1 Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling council. 2 He came to Jesus at night and said, ""Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him."" 3 Jesus replied, ""Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again. "" 4 ""How can someone be born when they are old?"" Nicodemus asked. ""Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother's womb to be born!"" 5 Jesus answered, ""Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. 6 Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. 7 You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born again.' 8 The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit."" 9 ""How can this be?"" Nicodemus asked. 10 ""You are Israel's teacher,"" said Jesus, ""and do you not understand these things? 11 Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. 12 I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? 13 No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven--the Son of Man. 14 Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, 15 that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him."" 16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. We all like new experience, new thing, new event, and meeting new persons. Some of you just graduated from the school you spent 2 years, 4 years and even 6 years. But, Suppose you have to go to a same school year after year but never graduating; you have only one place to visit year after year only; you have only one car to drive year after year; year by year getting old but never getting married; you have only one restaurant to go year after year. Your life would be like in a prison, so bored to death. Doing new things, having or trying new things always create some kind of excitement, hope, happiness and satisfaction. Only problem is our excitement doesn't last long before you find yourself longing another new thing. Solomon said he tried all the new things under the Sun: ""I also tried to find meaning by building huge homes for myself and by planting beautiful vineyards. 5 I made gardens and parks, filling them with all kinds of fruit trees. 6 I built reservoirs to collect the water to irrigate my many flourishing groves. 7 I bought slaves, both men and women, and others were born into my household. I also owned large herds and flocks, more than any of the kings who had lived in Jerusalem before me. 8 I collected great sums of silver and gold, the treasure of many kings and provinces. I hired wonderful singers, both men and women, and had many beautiful concubines. I had everything a man could desire!"
"Hebrews 10:25, Hebrews 3:12-13","('Graduation', 'Commitment To Church')",Baptist," Be Committed to Church ""let us not neglect our meeting together, as some people do, but encourage one another, especially now that the day of his return is drawing near."" (Hebrews 10:25 NLT) All the graduates, Congratulations! I commend you for all your accomplishment. We want to thank you for your faithfulness to this Church and to our EM group. May God lead and bless you as you are closing one chapter in your life and opening another new one. I you let me, I would offer a special recognition to JongHyun and Connie graduating from college because it is no longer a easy matter for any Christian to graduate college as Christian. A lot of surveys and researches have been done in terms of how many percentage of high school Christian graduates entering college remain Christian by the time they graduate college. Since many studies have been done, there are some variance in their analysis: some say only 50 percent maintain their faith, others say only 30% and still others only 10% What makes the situation worse is the religious trend among teenagers who tend to shy away from organized religion especially Christianity in ever increasing rate. It's almost scary. Just last week, a week ago last Sunday, I read fox news report, what they call ""11 million multiple surveys"". Two facts as conclusion: younger americans less likely to say religion is important in their lives; Today's teenagers are the least religious group of the last six decades Now then how can we fight back against the tide, such ungodly trend. Christian researchers identified several common factors among those who finish college years as strong believers. "" My parents were still married to each other and both attended church (prior to 18). "" Being trained in the church and At least one adult from church made a significant investment in me personally and spiritually (between 15 and 18). "" The pastor's sermons were relevant to my life (prior to 18). Concerning the parents' role there is nothing you can do about, but, I would like to share with you what you can do to stand strong in your faith in spite of Hostile environment against Christianity, that is, why it is important to commit yourself to church gathering. This would apply more to those in college and going into college than the rest of us, but it would apply to all of us one way or another.. 1. Why do you have to commit yourself to Church meeting? Because, you may continuously learn what you believe and why you believe. ""if someone asks about your Christian hope, always be ready to explain it."" 1 Peter 3:15 If you someone asks you about your faith and hope, are you ready to give him or her the answer? Can you honestly say you know what you believe and why you believe? One of the primary reasons why there are so many Drop-out Christians is because the professors. ""Tobin's findings echo the results of an earlier survey of college faculty summarized in the March, 2005 issue of the Washington Post. The article revealed that 72 percent of professors and instructors in colleges across the U.S. are liberal. That's a marked increase from just 20 years ago, when those who identified themselves as liberal was only 39 percent."""
"Matthew 22:37-40, Matthew 28:19-20","('Graduation', 'Commitment To Christ', 'Commitment To Church', 'Commitment To The Ministry')",Baptist," 3 Commitments 1. Commitment to Christ: ""Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. 38 This is the greatest and most important command..."" (Matthew 22:37-38) 2. Commitment to the body of Christ: ""The second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself. All the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commands."" (Matthew 22:39-40) 3. Commitment to the work of Christ : ""Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age."" (Matthew 28:19-20) I graduated from high school 40 years ago. 40 years and 5 months ago to be exact. Can you imagine I lived 40 years since then. Indeed, I do have many suggestions for people like you: I would say, for example, learn to speak fluently Korean and at least one more foreign languages, if your parents say OKay, plan to get married to your first girl or boy friend; I mean get married earlier than you now plan, and so on. But, for today, I would like to narrow down all my suggestions to one area, your spiritual life in terms of 3 commitments. Why commitment? Because you gonna do and gonna be what you are committed today. We are celebrating your graduation and your graduated from the school because you had committed to do so. (No doubt your parents also had committed to support you to finish the school.) It is the same in our spiritual life, to run all the way to the finish line we need commitment on our part but also we need to commit to help others. First of all, you need to commit yourself to the Lord. . Why do I say that? Because God commanded it: Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. 38 This is the greatest and most important command If you want to truly love the Lord you have to commit yourself to the Lord. But as you consider to commit yourself, remember He is not simply demanding your commitment to Him, but He committed Himself to you first. Indeed He first loved us and we are supposed to love Him: He demonstrated how much He loves us by sending His own Son. Going back to my high school years, I was very active in the church in my last 2 years of the high school years. I thought I loved the Lord, I even went to a bible college after the high school, but I didn't even know what it means to commit myself to the Lord nor how to commit myself to the Lord. It took about a year after I graduated from the high school that I finally learned what is involved in committing myself to the Lord and I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior. Though you may attend church, may be very active and you may be enrolled even in Bible college, however, that doesn't necessarily mean you are committed to Christ. There is a clear cut difference between church goer and Christian If you are not committed to Christ, you may be a church goer but not Christian. But, thanks to God, I know all of you accepted Jesus as your Lord and Savior as you committed yourself to Him and were all baptized. I am so grateful for that. Then, why do I emphasize the commitment to the Lord?"
Revelation 9:13,"('Book Of Revelation', 'Sixth Angel', 'Breastplates Of Fire')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 5-23-16 Lesson: III.C.8: Sixth Trumpet (Second Woe): Four Angels With an Army of Two Hundred Million, Killing A Third of Mankind (Revelation 9:13-21) Revelation 9:13-21 (KJV) 13 And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God, 14 Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates. 15 And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men. 16 And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them. 17 And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone. 18 By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths. 19 For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt. 20 And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk: 21 Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts. Introduction The horror of the vision mounts. The demonic locusts were allowed to injure but not kill; but now come the squadrons of demonic cavalry to annihilate a third part of the human race. Since the appearance of the eagle announcing the three woes in 8:13, the trumpets have been identified as woes (9:12). What is identified as the second woe here is also the six trumpet. This is a passage which is mysterious and whose details no one has ever been able to fully explain. John's conviction, though voiced as a lament, that idolatry has a hold on man so great that he will go on worshipping the works of his own hands even while the infinite power of the true God is displayed all about him. A subtle implication at the end of the passage is that the world is just this way. John wrote to Christians to encourage them to be faithful to God even though this evil world rejects Him. They must bear their witness in this world--as it exists. Commentary ? There were two alters in the ancient tabernacle, one stood without, in the court (the brazen alter; the alter of sacrifice)--and one stood within the Holy Place directly in front of the veil which covered the holy of holies (the ""golden alter,"" where incense was burned.). There is another ""golden altar;"" it is in heaven in front of the throne of God. It is not known whether this was the voice of Christ or of an angel, one of His delegated messengers. The ""horns of the golden altar,"" refers to the heavenly altar and its four decorative projections, one at each corner (See Exodus 27:2). This is where the ""voice""--one voice, instead of a symphony of the voices of all the martyrs (6:9, 10), and a voice of authority instead of an angel's voice--seemed to emanate, and it is probably the same altar mentioned in 8:3, the place where the prayers of the saints have been expressed to God. According to 6:9, this altar was where the souls of all who had been martyred were waiting for God's punishment to be executed on their enemies. Their prayers called for vengeance, and God was releasing it in these ""woes"": ""As I watched, I heard an eagle that was flying in midair call out in a loud voice: ""Woe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the other three angels!"" (8:13)."
Isaiah 6:1-12,"('Repentance', 'Holiness', 'Vision From Heaven', 'Security In Christ')",United Methodist," In the Year King Uzziah Died Isaiah 6:1-12 For as long as I have lived, Queen Elizabeth has set on the throne of Great Britain. Considering that I am nearing retirement age, this is quite a feat. She has been an inspiration to her subjects for 65 years. Even though her powers are constitutionally limited, she still is the social glue that keeps Great Britain together in turbulent social and political times. I remember when at a large football stadium the people sang God Save the Queen for the 50th anniversary of becoming Queen, you could see the tears and the great emotional outpouring of 100,000 people there. Even here in America, I can remember at St. Thomas Episcopal Church in New York the church singing ""God Save the Queen."" The sun may indeed set on the British Empire, but it does not set on those who admire her. Recently, the tabloids have reported about her health setbacks as she nears 91 years of age. There is a sense of fear in the people because she unifies the people. With the Brexit looming, what will happen to Great Britain? What will become of the monarchy? Will King Charles or as some suggest King William be able to bring stability in a time of upheaval? This brings us to this morning's text which begins with: ""In the year King Uzziah died."" At first it might be seen as a time marker to date the prophecy, but it is worth taking a deeper look at this statement. Uzziah was king over Judah for over fifty years. Only a few people there could remember any other king than Uzziah. Uzziah was seen as a source of stability in turbulent waters. Political, social, and religious threats threaten to engulf and swallow Judah. Even so, it was a time of prosperity for the nation. Isaiah lampoons Judah for her improper use of this prosperity and neglecting the needs of the poor, but it was generally good times for many. Uzziah wielded more political power than Queen Elizabeth, but there were limitation to his power as well. The Israelite monarchy was not meant to be absolute. For the great kink Solomon, Uzziah's ancestor had been anointed King by Zadok the Priest and Nathan the Prophet. This by the way is the text of Handel's great coronation anthem ""Zadok the Priest"" which is played at the coronation of a monarch in Great Britain. I remember Prince Edward commenting on this that the British people wanted the monarch ruled by the grace of God, the church and the people of Britain. Even the coins of the realm bear the motto in Latin which is translated ""Queen by the grace of God."" Uzziah is recorded to have been a pretty godly king, but he made one costly mistake. This is recorded in 2 Chronicles 26. He became angry with the priests and took the censor from them to offer the priestly service himself. The priesthood was established by God and the priests were separated from the people of Israel. Uzziah was king and not priest. It says that God struck Uzziah with leprosy. In a great irony, God separated Uzziah from the people of Israel, by his being shut up as a leper."
Job 40:1-24,"('Humility', 'Behemoth', 'The Beast Within', 'Simile', 'Humble The Proud')",Calvary Chapel," Job 40: 1 - 24 Behemoth - The Beast Within 1 Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said 2 ""Shall the one who contends with the Almighty correct Him? He who rebukes God, let him answer it."" 3 Then Job answered the LORD and said: 4 ""Behold, I am vile; What shall I answer You? I lay my hand over my mouth. 5 Once I have spoken, but I will not answer; Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further."" 6 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said: 7 ""Now prepare yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer Me: 8 ""Would you indeed annul My judgment? Would you condemn Me that you may be justified? 9 Have you an arm like God? Or can you thunder with a voice like His? 10 Then adorn yourself with majesty and splendor, and array yourself with glory and beauty. 11 Disperse the rage of your wrath; Look on everyone who is proud, and humble him. 12 Look on everyone who is proud, and bring him low; Tread down the wicked in their place. 13 Hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in hidden darkness. 14 Then I will also confess to you that your own right hand can save you. 15 ""Look now at the behemoth, which I made along with you; He eats grass like an ox. 16 See now, his strength is in his hips, and his power is in his stomach muscles. 17 He moves his tail like a cedar; The sinews of his thighs are tightly knit. 18 His bones are like beams of bronze, his ribs like bars of iron. 19 He is the first of the ways of God; Only He who made him can bring near His sword. 20 Surely the mountains yield food for him, and all the beasts of the field play there. 21 He lies under the lotus trees, in a covert of reeds and marsh. 22 The lotus trees cover him with their shade; The willows by the brook surround him. 23 Indeed the river may rage, yet he is not disturbed; He is confident, though the Jordan gushes into his mouth, 24 though he takes it in his eyes, or one pierces his nose with a snare. We are going to take a look at some significant things which have us believers looking stupid to those in the world around us. We have a lot of theologians contend back and forth about two creations revealed by our Holy and Majestic God specifically in chapters 40 and 41. These two are Behemoth and Leviathan. I for one strongly believe that this should not be happening. Our Great God Is not the author of confusion. Our Precious Lord and Savior Jesus Christ said this to us who believe in Him, ""No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I heard from My Father I have made known to you.[John 15:15]. So ask yourself should our Master Who has just said how He has made known to us through the Word of God The Father's truth give us some mysteries that we cannot figure out? So far I have found three possible explanations as to the exact identity of the biblical creatures known as behemoth and leviathan: (1) They are unreal, mythological monsters"

Southeast regularly runs over 20,000 on the weekend services...and on Easter Sunday those numbers exploded even bigger...Here's a video of Kyle expressing how he felt as he approached one Easter weekend...and how it influenced his thinking about being a follower of Jesus...and not just a fan. SHOW VIDEO (1:22) Kyle says, ""The biggest threat to the church today is fans who call themselves Christians but aren't actually interested in following Christ...our churches in America have gone from being sanctuaries to stadiums...and every week fans come to the stadium where they cheer for Jesus but have no interest in actually following Him."" The question this morning is how would we honestly define our relationship with Jesus...Are we ""enthusiastic admirers,"" which is the dictionary definition of ""a fan,"" or are we followers, which is what a disciple is all about? Jesus' Great Commission was to ""Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."" It's such a simple command...""As you follow me make other followers of me."" But following Jesus requires more than belief and admiration...It requires action. [Suppose you were out hiking one day and you decide to get off the trail and explore some of the most untraveled areas...and you get lost...I mean you are really lost and can't find your way out...and after a couple of days you are desperate...you're cold, wet, and hungry. And as you huddle at the base of a tree a rescue searcher calls your name...and you scream back... ""I'm here...Hey, over here."" And he finds you and says ""Follow me."" Now you believe he has come to rescue you...you admire his sacrifice to try and find you...but you say, ""No, I'll just stay where I am and wait for a better time...I think I can still find my own way out""...Does your belief get you home? No! Does your admiration for your rescuer save you? Not by a long shot. If you're going to get home...you have to follow him out.] When it comes to fulfilling Jesus' Great Commission to make followers who follow Him...we have to be followers who follow Him...we have to be following Him first...and that following starts with my death, burial and resurrection.

Galatians 5:13-15,"('Service', 'Love', 'Freedom', 'Conflict')",Evangelical Free," A pastor in Kansas City, Kansas, was organizing opportunities for people in his church to do small acts of kindness as a demonstration of Christ's love in the community. He phoned several neighborhood grocery stores and Laundromats for permission to do specific services. In one call, the employee who answered the phone hesitated, then said, ""I'll need to ask the manager, but first, let me make sure I understand: You want to clean up the parking lot, retrieve shopping carts, hold umbrellas for customers, and you don't want anything in return."" ""Yes, that's right,"" the pastor replied. After disappearing for a moment, the employee returned to the phone. ""I'm sorry,"" he said, ""we can't let you do that because if we let you do it, we'd have to let everyone else do it, too!"" (Ann Jeffries, Kansas City, Kansas, ""Lite Fare,"" Christian Reader; www.PreachingToday.com) How silly. Why NOT let everyone else do it? Wouldn't that be wonderful if everyone found ways to serve? It would be a little like heaven on earth. Do you want to find a little heaven in your home? Do you want to find a little heaven in your work? Do you want to find a little heaven in all your relationships? Then learn to serve. It's the reason why Christ set us free. If you have your Bibles, I invite you to turn with me to Galatians 5, Galatians 5, where we begin to see what our freedom in Christ means to us practically and how it can positively impact all our relationships. Galatians 5:13 You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love. (ESV) God called us to freedom, so we could love, not lust. God called us to freedom, so we could serve one another, not be in bondage to our sinful natures. So, since you are free... DON'T SERVE YOURSELF. Don't indulge your sinful nature. Don't give in to the demands of your baser desires. Literally, do not let your freedom become a base of operations (or a beachhead) for the flesh. In the early morning of June 6, 1944, 5300 ships carrying 153,000 American and Allied troops landed on the beaches of Normandy, France. It was D-Day, and the Allied Forces knew that if they could establish a beachhead at Normandy, they would eventually win the war, and that's exactly what they did. They established that beachhead at Normandy, used it as a base of operations to push the Germans back, and eventually won the war. That's the picture we have here in verse 13. God is saying to us, ""Don't use your freedom as a beachhead for selfish indulgence. Instead, use it as a beachhead for selfless service."" Leo Tolstoy's story Two Old Men tells the tale of two men, Efim and Elisha, who decide that before they die they must make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. After months of planning, they collect what they will need and begin to walk. After a long day on the road, they come to a village that seems deserted. Seeing a small hut, they look in to see what has happened. They enter its darkness and smell death. As their eyes adjust to the lack of light, they see bodies on beds. With some fear and trepidation, they come close and see that the people are still alive, but barely."
John 5:1-14,"('Healing', 'Wellness')",Christian/Church Of Christ," Do You Want To Get Well? 1Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews. 2Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades. 3Here a great number of disabled people used to lie--the blind, the lame, the paralyzed. 5One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. 6When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, ""Do you want to get well?"" 7""Sir,"" the invalid replied, ""I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me."" 8Then Jesus said to him, ""Get up! Pick up your mat and walk."" 9At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath, 10and so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, ""It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat."" HEY - isn't that just like the religious... Failing to rejoice in God moving because things were not done the way they think things ought to be done. I MEAN - a guy who has been an invalid for 38 years is now walking, that's good news, right? But he replied, ""The man who made me well said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.' "" 12So they asked him, ""Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?"" 13The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there. - John 5:1-13 IT - was a located just north of the Temple area in Jerusalem. It was a large pool surrounded by 5 colonnades or porches. It was built many years earlier to be a monument of wealth and prosperity... but it's residents now, are people of sickness and disease. IT was called the pool of 'Bethesda' a word that means 'house of mercy. AND - mercy is what the multitudes who were gathered that day were longing for... LISTEN - to how one author describes the scene; PICTURE - a battleground filled with wounded bodies, and you see Bethesda. IMAGINE - a nursing home overcrowded and understaffed, and you see the pool. CALL - to mind the orphans in Bangladesh or the abandoned in New Delhi, and you will see what people saw when they passed Bethesda. AND - as they passed, what did they hear? (An endless wave of groans). WHAT - did they witness? (A field of faceless need). WHAT - did they do? (Most walked past, ignoring the people). BUT - not Jesus. He is in Jerusalem for a feast. He is alone. He's not there to teach the disciples or to draw a crowd. The people need him so he's there. CAN - you picture it? Jesus walking among the suffering? WHAT - is He thinking? WHEN - an infected hand touches his ankle what does he do? WHEN - a blind child stumbles in Jesus' path, does he reach down to catch the child? WHEN - wrinkled hand extends for alms, how does Jesus respond? ... HOW - does God feel when people hurt? NOW - it's worth telling the story if all we do is watch him walk. IT'S - worth it just to know that he came. He didn't have to you know."
"Matthew 6:25-33, Psalms 77:1-15","('Seeking God', 'King Manasseh')",Christian/Church Of Christ," MELVIN NEWLAND, MINISTER RIDGE CHAPEL, KANSAS, OK (PowerPoints used with this message are available for free. Just email me at mnewland@sstelco.com and request #308.) TEXT: Matthew 6:26-33; Psalm 77:1-15 ILL. In the ancient Persian folktale, ""Aladdin,"" Aladdin is the son of a poor tailor. After his father's death, a wicked magician, who claims to be Aladdin's long-lost uncle, persuades Aladdin to go after an old lamp hidden in a cave. Aladdin gets the lamp, but suspicious of the magician's intentions, refuses to give it to him. The magician becomes furious at this & seals Aladdin in the cave, leaving him to die there all alone. Well, to make the story shorter, Aladdin discovers that the lamp contains a magic genie with the power to grant wishes. And as Aladdin makes his wishes, he becomes immensely wealthy, marries the sultan's daughter, defeats a fiendish plot by the wicked magician, & lives happily ever after. It is a fantasy that has captured the imagination of millions in many countries down through the centuries. Disney Studios took the story & made it into a hit animated movie found in the homes of many children today. A. Why? Why the popularity of ""Aladdin""? Well, I think there are a couple of reasons. First of all, we like to see the underdog come out on top, so we cheer for Aladdin. Secondly, I think we like to day-dream about having our own magic genie, & having all our wishes granted. But we're never going to have a magic genie. No one is going to appear suddenly & give us everything we want. It just doesn't work that way. If we want something we'll have to work for it. If our hopes & dreams are ever to be realized, we have to put forth an effort to bring them to pass. But I'm afraid that many have gotten their priorities confused. So much time is spent worrying about ""things"" that we lose sight of what truly matters. We seek gold while dismissing God. We seek health while neglecting holiness. We seek the latest fashions while ignoring robes of righteousness, & many wonder why they can't seem to find happiness while ignoring God. Of course, there are people hoping to ""strike it rich,"" to make some ""easy money,"" to win the lottery, to find the buried treasure. And they go through life, one day after another, hoping & worrying about what the future may bring. Now with that in mind, listen to Jesus in Matthew 6:26, ""Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, & yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?"" Continuing on in vs's 28-33, ""See how the lilies of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. ""If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today & tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' ""For the pagans run after all these things, & your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first His kingdom & His righteousness, & all these things will be given to you as well."""
Philippians 4:20-23,"('Grace', 'Fellowship', 'Blessing', 'Relationships')",Baptist," A Benediction to the Beloved Philippians 4: 20-23 As you study Paul's epistle to the Philippian church, it quickly becomes evident that they are very dear to his heart. They were his crown of rejoicing, and he longed to come to them once again if the Lord allowed. Having shared much with them, in an effort to increase their joy, and further equip them in the faith, Paul offered some gracious parting words. While he had done all he could while serving among them, he desired the church to remain vibrant and strong, even in his absence. Our text today offers nothing the believers had not heard before. Paul does not offer a deep, theological discussion, but he does offer words that were beneficial to the church in Philippi, and they remain relevant for us today. We have all heard the phrase - ""it is easy to miss the forest for the trees."" While we must focus on those deep, theological truths at times, the simple truths offer profound hope and courage as well. We must not allow the familiar to become so routine that we lose the wonder of it all. As we conclude our study in Philippians, I want to consider these parting words as we discuss: A Benediction to the Beloved. I. The Honor Expressed (20) - Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen. Paul had just spoken of the gracious provision of the Lord on our behalf, and he urged the church to give the Lord the honor and praise He deserved. Consider: A. The Deity - Paul had spoken much about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. He will have more to say about Him in the concluding thought, but he didn't want the church to forget or overlook God the Father. Paul was well aware of the gracious provision of the Father as well. He too loved humanity and the church. He was willing to send His only begotten Son as the sacrifice for our sin. Paul knew every blessing they enjoyed had come from the good hand of God. I stand amazed at the grace and provision of God. He is the Sovereign of the Ages, Creator of the universe, and yet He is mindful of you and me. His love for us is without question. He continually provides for our needs, and was willing to give His Son for our salvation. Surely He is worthy of our recognition, adoration, and praise! B. The Devotion - Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen. I am certain Paul realized that God's glory and deity were not dependent upon man's recognition or praise. His very nature reveals His glory. He is glorious because He is God. His glory is so radiant and overwhelming that is impossible for mankind to gaze upon it and live. Do you remember the encounter Moses had with God in the cleft of the rock? God only allowed Moses to see the backside of His glory, and yet the face of Moses shone so after the encounter that he had to wear a veil as he spoke to the people. God is radiant in His glory. However, it is clear that Paul encouraged the church to offer the Father praise and worship. While we cannot add to His glory, we can offer the praise He is due. Within the context of this verse, it speaks of honor, praise, and worship."
Micah 6:1-8,"('Mercy', 'Humility', 'Social Justice')",United Methodist," ""What Does God Want?"" Micah 6:1-8 18 years ago I was an Associate Pastor at a big church in Macon, Georgia and also going to seminary at the same time. I felt God calling me to reach out to a community of folks I had just recently heard about. It was a homeless shelter for indigent people living with HIV and AIDS. And the place was an old hotel. It was called the ""Rainbow Center."" This was back when there was still a really BIG stigma attached to HIV and AIDS. I suppose there still is, but I pray it's not as bad as it was then. In any event, I called the person who ran the Rainbow Center, introduced myself and asked if I could get involved in ministry there. He wasn't too thrilled to be hearing from me. ""What do you want to do,"" he asked hesitantly. ""Well,"" I said, ""I'd like to get to know you and the folks living there and perhaps I can learn from you and you can help me and perhaps I can help you."" He opened up to that. He told me that the residents eat a common meal in a common room every Friday afternoon. He invited me to come. I went, and continued to go until I finished seminary and no longer worked for that church. I was later told by the director, who became a dear friend, that the reason he was leery of me at first was because the only Christian Pastors who had ever called him in the past had wanted to come over and beat the people over the head with the Bible. The people at the Rainbow Center already felt judgement and condemnation. They'd felt it most of their lives. No one had ever wanted to build relationships, become part of the community, make friendships, love and help in other ways. It was one of the most rewarding ministries I have ever been involved in. Soon, some other members of the church decided to join me for lunch on Fridays. And the people living at the Rainbow Center started to become friends. They started to trust me and the other folks from the church who would just hang out with them on Friday afternoons. Soon, a group of about 15 residents decided they wanted to come to church. I didn't have to ask them--they asked me. So, every Sunday, a church member named Wally would drive one of the church vans to the Rainbow Center and pick up this wonderful motley crew of people--black and white, male and female, prostitutes, homosexuals, drug addicts and former drug addicts--who had contracted HIV and AIDS and were now homeless and whose families no longer claimed them as their own--and bring them to this big, middle to upper middle class white church where I was Associate Pastor. They went to Sunday school classes that eventually ""sort of"" adopted them. The church started collecting toiletries and food goods for the center. Residents would call me up at all hours of the day and night needing rides and money... ...and since I was a bit younger then and didn't have a young family like I do now--it worked out pretty well."
Daniel 1:1-6:22,"('New Year',)",Assembly Of God," The New Year is Aglow with Opportunities Daniel 1:1-7: 3:1-18; 6:1-22 We have now completed one month in the year 2016 and we are faced with many challenges and opportunities. As a Christian we are rowing upstream against a society that is basically anti-Christian. We are also living in a period where many churches are turning liberal in their theology and where commitment and dedication are hard to find qualities and where a faithful and dedicated Christian is a dying breed. In addition we have developed a "" tourist mindset"" in our practice of our christianity. We hop to see the latest christian personality (with the "" anointing"") or investigate the latest ""blessings"". Tourists want only the high points and they want entertainment. A christian cannot come to maturity this way. Many things about the future are both exciting and fearful. No matter what we face in the unpredictable 2016, as cultural, political and spiritual changes approach us a high speed, few of us will experience the intense, painful opportunities that a man named Daniel faced. Though this story is 2,500 years old, the message is as contemporary as today's headlines. In every crisis and trauma Daniel faced God used him for good in the world. What do we know about Daniel? A contemporary of Jeremiah and his fellow exile Ezekiel, Daniel (lit. ―God is my Judge‖) is unquestionably the author of the book which bears his name. Ezekiel refers to Daniel (cf. Ezek 14:14, 20; 28:3.) Daniel and his three compatriots, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, were forced into exile in 605 B.C. when Nebuchadnezzar descended for the first time upon Jehoiakim's kingdom of Judah. Daniel was of the royal seed. We can see that Daniel was a well-rounded young man. He not only was smart he was healthy and physically fit. We also can see that Daniel and his friends had godly parents who gave them a good grounding in the Word of God. Also Daniel had a high social standing. He was a relative of the king of Judah, raised with all the privileges and status of royalty: wealth, power and education. He probably had close connections with dignitaries throughout the Eastern Mediterranean world. With all his wealth and charm Daniel was every mother-in-law's dream. Yet with his privileges Daniel was not proud or arrogant. He was a young man of character. He was not lazy or self-indulgent. He was absolutely committed to God and refused to compromise himself in any area. Daniel was also was a young man with a future. He would have been voted the most likely to succeed in his class. But Daniel was caught in a system and culture that forgot God. The exile did not come overnight. It was due to a long period of rebellion against God's revealed will for Israel. Daniel was caught in a culture that ignored God. When a nation forgets God, everyone suffers : the righteous along with the unrighteous. God repeatedly sent prophets to warn the people of Israel but they continued to rebel and live in sin. In 605BC God allowed the superpower of that day, Nebuchadnezaar and his Babylonian armies to attack Jerusalem and take over the city."
Romans 5:8-11,"('Atonement', 'The Cross', 'Atonement Of Christ')",Assembly Of God," The cross of Jesus (Part1) As we start the period of Lent we shall be focusing on the cross of Jesus It is universally known that the standard symbol of Christianity is the cross.. Now there are many other symbols that the church could have chosen as a sign of the Christian Faith. But the Church has selected the Cross - why is this? The cross has chosen because the early Christians wished to make known that the main emphasis of the ministry of Jesus was not His birth, His teaching, His miracles, or even His Deity but .His death and crucifixion. There is no gospel without the cross neither would we be reconciled to God. The gospels portrays Christ not as a baby in the manager, a worker of miracles. a preacher and teacher of distinction, but as the crucified Savior. The good news of the gospel is that through our Lord's atoning death we have been given a new life. People wear a cross as a piece of jewellery even though they do not have any interest in what the cross stands for. So what does the cross signify? We will look into this issue in depth in this study, but consider this idea now - the cross made possible reconciliation between a holy and righteous God and a sinful man. The word ""reconciliation "" signifies a restoration of relationships between two parties. In Romans 5:8-11 Paul makes clear that our sin made us enemies of God. But the death of Christ made it possible for us to have fellowship with Him. Rom 5:8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Rom 5:9 Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. Rom 5:10 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. Rom 5:11 And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement. (KJV) Reconciliation is the meaning of the 'atonement' and shows what God has done for us in making us 'at one' with Himself. Now what does the word 'atonement' mean. The word ""atonement"" occurs frequently in the Old Testament and represents a key concept of OT theology. Many Christians think atonement in the OT originated with the Mosaic law, but in reality we recognized our need for atonement long before the time of Moses. When Adam and Eve committed the first sin, they hid from God because they were ashamed (Gn 3:8). Rather than giving them up as hopeless, God initiated a plan of atonement whereby the ruptured fellowship between Himself and humanity could be restored. Our English word ""atonement"" (at-one-ment) explains well the theology behind such restoration, for it suggests that God and humanity can relationally be ""at one"" again. How does atonement work? The first OT reference to atonement occurs when God provided animal skins to cover Adam and Eve's nakedness, an act necessitating the death of a sinless animal and hence the shedding of its blood on their behalf (Gn 3:21). This introduces a theme that runs throughout the Bible: atonement involves an innocent party taking the punishment that was due to a guilty party."
Leviticus 16:5-22,"('Message Of The Cross', 'The Cross And Grace', 'The Cross In The Ot')",Assembly Of God," The cross of Christ in the Old Testament. Today we shall look into biblical typology and see how the scriptures pictured Christ and the cross in the Old Testament. What is typology? A biblical ""type"" may be safely described as ""any person, place, event or thing in the Old Testament that serves the covenantal purposes of God, in a preparatory manner, until the fulfilling all things in redemption through the ""anti-type"", Jesus Christ, or some particular benefit of His saving work."" The fulfillment in the New Testament is termed ""anti-type"" Typology is a study of types. Etymologically the word ""type"" is derived from the Greek word which denotes: (1) the impression made by a blow; (2) the stamp made by a die--thus figure or image; (3) an example or pattern. The latter is the most common meaning in the Bible. It is a ""type"" which prefigures some future reality. In I Corinthians 10:6 this Greek word is employed to speak of certain Exodus events as a ""type"" of Christian life, in Romans 5:14 that Adam is a ""type"" of Christ, and in I Peter 3:21 a related word is used to indicate that Baptism is an ""antitype"" of the flood. Genesis and The Cross The chief scene that many of the 'types' in the Old Testament foreshadow is the most solemn event that has ever taken place on earth: the scene of Jesus' death on the cross. There are quite a few examples we can study to see these types that foreshadow His life and death on the cross. First, in Genesis 4, we see the story of Abel's lamb as a type for the sacrifice of Jesus thousands of years later. God declares Abel's sacrificial offering of the ""firstborn of his flock"" as worthy and that of Cain's unworthy. See Genesis 4:4. Abel's offering comes through a repentant and faithful heart, giving his best of his work from the land, while Cain's heart is unrepentant and he fails to sacrifice his best fruits in the offering. This ""firstborn"" mention of the lamb is possibly a type that refers to Jesus as the ""firstborn of all creation"" that reconciled all things to Himself through the shedding of His blood. (Colossians 1:15) Abel's offering signifies the individual sacrifice that Jesus made for each individual in His own sacrificial death. Secondly, there is the identification of Jesus in the New Testament with the Old Testament remembrance of the Passover lamb. The Passover celebration was initiated with God's rescuing the Israelites from the Egyptians by putting the blood of the sacrificial lamb over their doorposts. (See Exodus 12) When Jesus comes to earth, He identifies Himself as the Passover lamb, the ultimate and final sacrifice for the people's sin. This sacrifice then, represents the sin of the nation atoned for via first the lamb's sacrifice, and now, via Jesus' death once and for all. It was revealed to John the Baptist that Jesus was the lamb, as he cries out in John 1:29 and 35, ""Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!"" In the institution of the Last Supper, Jesus recognizes that He will be the final Passover lamb to sacrifice for the sins of the world, saying, ""This is my body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of me."" (Luke 22:19)"
Matthew 4:16-22,"('Discrimination', 'Justice', 'Injustice', 'Darkness And Light')",Episcopal," Matthew 4:16-22 When we proclaim our profession of faith, we say: 'We believe on One God. . . God from God, Light from Light'. . . I imagine that all of us have been afraid of the dark at some time in our lives. . . afraid of the monster under the bed, . . . the creature in the closet, . . . the shadows on the wall, . . . the distance of darkness between us and the nearest room with light. These dangers may have been imaginary, but everyone has had periods in their life as children and adults when darkness has stricken us to our very core with fear - shaking, our hearts thumping with fear! I have a confession to make. I do still get a little anxious when I'm walking in a dark or unfamiliar place by myself; maybe it's not being able to see; or maybe it's not knowing who's there or what to expect. Or maybe it's that being alone in the dark feels so just really alone. On the other hand, I find it amazing that light, any light, quickly dispels the anxiety darkness provokes. Just to see a light, is so comforting, even if it's some distance away. In some way, it's like a visible reassurance that there is somebody there, somewhere. And, of course, the closer you get to the light, the less you feel that anxious fear. As we grow up, we learn that all of these dark fears are baseless, just childhood imaginations. But as we grow up, we find that darkness takes other forms - mostly fear - a sort of psychological darkness or fear of being lost,. . . fear of failure, . . . fear of personal unworthiness, . . . fear of concern for our ability to care for our families, . . . fear that we will not make correct choices, . . . fear of illness, . . . fear of loss of loved ones, . . . fear about what is happening in our nation and the world. Last week has been full of significant events: we honored Martin Luther King, Jr. for the stand he took to bring for equality to all. Indeed, he gave his life to bring light to the darkness of racial discrimination. Our nation, bitterly divided about our recent election and its consequences, just saw the inauguration of the next President of the United States. There is fear that this inauguration will have consequences so far-reaching that history will record difficult and disastrous changes to the United States and the world. We also see that much of the world is fearful too! So amidst all this fear - this dark unknowing and black negativity - where is the light? How can we find that light? How can we be that light? If the new administration begins to mark people as ""other"" (based on their creed, color, gender, sexual orientation, income, age and health status) and targets them for deportation and various forms of discrimination, we need to step in to protect them from the looming darkness. As people of faith, we know no ""other""; we are one, and when one of us suffers, we all suffer. We are all children of God. During the Civil War, Union generals told President Abraham Lincoln that the Union would win because 'God was on their side'. But Abraham Lincoln wisely asked:"

""Stand up, plead your case before the mountains; let the hills hear what you have to say. Micah pictures a court of law, with Israel ""on trial"" before the Lord. "" As Israel steps up to the witness stand, God asks them, ""What have I done to you?"" He has done nothing but good to Israel, and has been repaid with rejection and rebellion. "" God says, ""I redeemed you from the house of bondage"": God did for Israel an enormous amount of good. He redeemed them and gave them godly leaders. God's case against Israel looks pretty good. 4I brought you up out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery "" God even gave them great Leaders to guide them vs 4I sent Moses to lead you, also Aaron and Miriam.

2 Timothy 2:3-4,"('Soldier', 'Warfare', 'Warrior For Christ')",Assembly Of God," WARRIORS FOR CHRIST 2 Tim. 2:3-4 INTRODUCTION A. HUMOR 1. At one Army base, the annual trip to the rifle range had been canceled for the second year in a row, but the semi-annual physical fitness test was still on as planned. One soldier mused, ""Does it bother anyone else that the Army doesn't seem to care how well we can shoot, but they're extremely interested in how fast we can run?"" 2. As a group of soldiers stood in formation at an Army Base, the Drill Sergeant said, ""All right! All you idiots fall out."" As the rest of the squad wandered away, one soldier remained at attention. The Drill Instructor walked over until he was eye-to-eye with him, and then raised a single eyebrow. The soldier smiled and said, ""Sure was a lot of 'em, huh, sir?"" 3. AIR FORCE RECRUITS a. The Air Force was way undermanned so they did a special hiring effort. A pair of twin brothers who looked like they had just stepped off a Marine Corps recruiting poster walked up to them. b. The Air Force recruiter asked, ""Son, what skills can you bring to the Air Force?"" The first brother said, ""I'm a pilot!"" The recruiter got all excited, turns to his aide and says, ""Get him signed up today!"" c. The recruiter asked the 2nd brother, ""What skills to you bring to the Air Force?"" ""I chop wood!"" ""We don't need wood choppers in the Air Force, what do you know how to do?"" ""I chop wood!"" ""You're not listening to me, we don't need wood choppers, this is the 20th century!"" d. ""Well,"" the young man said, ""you hired my brother!"" ""Yes, but he's a pilot!"" ""So what! I have to chop it before he can pile it!"" B. THESIS & TITLE 1. We Christians must know that we're combatants in a universal War. This knowledge will prepare our minds with the alertness and toughness to get through this life victoriously. 2. The title of this message is ""Warriors for Christ."" I. WARFARE: A FOREIGN CONCEPT TO THE N.T.? A. WARFARE IN O.T. TIMES 1. Throughout the O.T., warrior terminology was used because Israel was actively engaged in warfare with their surrounding neighbor-nations. 2. David said, ""He [God] trains my hands for battle"" 2 Sam. 22:35. David saw his physical battles as spiritual battles, because his nation alone had the knowledge of God, while all other nations were idolaters. If the other nations won, their gods won. 3. So they really were in a spiritual, as well as physical battle. David said that God trained him to win those battles. So we understand the use of O.T. warfare/ military terminology. B. WARFARE IN THE N.T.? CAN'T BE! 1. But when we get to the N.T., we're surprised to Paul and the Apostles also using military terminology in reference to our spiritual lives. They tell us that Christians are in a war. We are to fight because we're soldiers in Christ's army. We have weapons and armor. 2. ""Wait a minute!"" you say. ""I thought we're supposed to love our enemies, not fight them!"" 3. Well, the Bible does say that some humans are used as tools of the devil. Certainly the Jewish leaders were, Ananias & Sapphira, the Antichrist, Bar-Jesus, Judas, Alexander the Silversmith, and even Peter were named as people through whom satan operated to accomplish some aim (and he still uses people today!)"
Micah 6:1-8,"('Forgiveness', 'Humility', 'Laws Of Moses', 'Three Commands')",Anglican," How many of you have even been in court because of a lawsuit? If so, then the passage from Micah 6:1-8 sounds very familiar. This passage resembles a lawsuit that is being heard in court. Micah calls creation as a witness. The mountains, present throughout all of Israel's history, are called on as witnesses, because they have ""seen"" all that the Israelites have done. God's creation has witnessed the relationship between God and His people, so it was well-suited to reach a just verdict in this case. God questioned His people and gave them a chance to respond. God told of His faithfulness to his people in the past and demands obedience to the covenant he established with His people. The Israelites believed that God has wronged them. He challenged them to provide evidence to support their claims. He directed the events surrounding their flight from Egypt. When they remembered what He did for them in the past, their faith was strengthened. God showed in this passage that he was willing to set things right. He was not unjust to the Israelites, nor did He ask too much from them. He addressed them tenderly and compassionately. He kept the promises He made. On the other hand, the Israelites did not keep their promises. Spiritual blindness led them to offer everything except the one thing that God really wanted-a spiritual commitment from their hearts. Right behaviour would have resulted from this commitment. God isn't interested in sacrifices. He is more concerned with our attitudes. They come from the deepest part of our lives-our hearts-and show themselves in positive actions toward God and His people. God displayed considerable emotion in His dispute with Israel. For the Israelites to claim that God wearied them gave the impression that he did something to make them impatient and disobedient. In reality, He had mightily delivered them-from Egypt to Gilgal-in fidelity to His righteous nature and covenant promises. In verses 6-8, Micah summarizes the laws of Moses into three commands. These few things are what God truly desires of His covenant people, not innumerable sacrifices offered without a commitment to faithful living. The word ""mercy"" in the Hebrew language includes the idea of loyalty and faithfulness to God's promises. When we repent and walk with God, He will show us mercy. In fact, He loves to show us mercy. There is a connection between forgiveness and obedience. Since Israel had experienced a gracious remission of her sin of worshipping the golden calf, what sort of people were they to be now? The logical question for them to ask would have been, ""What does God require of us?"" The logical answer would have been the same things God provided to the Israelites when they repented: mercy, justice and humility. These things aren't always easy to do. They are not one-time accomplishments to be completed and checked off a list. They will help us understand God's heart, and in turn our own hearts will be shaped as we put these things into practice."

As he walked down the hallway, a light came on in his parent's bedroom and his mom asked, ""What time is it?"" It's midnight, Mom,"" he replied. But at just that moment, the family cuckoo clock let out two cuckoos. So Billy stood in the hallway and cuckooed ten more times! Now, do you think that boy fooled his mother? Of course not. ""You can be sure that your sin will track you down."" - Numbers 32:23 (The Message)"
Matthew 5:13-17,"('Stability', 'Witnessing', 'Sermon On The Mount', 'Salt Of The Earth', 'Ehmis ')",*other,atthew 5:13-17; Psalms 112:1-10; 1 Corinthians 2:1-," Theme: Jesus Salt! Proposition: Jesus affirms and encourages his disciples by sharing the Good News that they are the salt of the World. I. Like Salt we are to be Stable and Consistent II. Like salt we are to be Essential and Indispensible III. Jesus wants us to be Salt that is bursting with Flavor INTRO: Grace and peace from God our Father and from Jesus Christ, His Son who came to take away the sin of the world! This morning, I would like for us to look at a passage of scripture that we find in Jesus' Sermon on the Mount as recorded by St. Matthew. In chapter five, Matthew begins by telling us that Jesus wanted some quality time alone with his disciples. So, Jesus leads them up on a high mountain to get away from all the hustle and bustle of the crowds. What Jesus has to say to them is/was of the highest importance and he did not want them to be distracted by a great deal of noise. Jesus was wanting them to understand what it meant to be a Christ follower. That is what we discover as we read Matthew chapters five through seven. Matthew shares with us this beautiful collection of Jesus' teachings, principles and virtues that make up what it means to follow Jesus. This morning, if you have ever wondered what it means to be a disciple of Jesus then I would encourage you to take some time to read the Sermon on the Mount. However, let me also add a word of caution. Please don't attempt to fully understand and assimilate all of the Sermon on the Mount in one or two sittings. You will discover that it cannot be done and then you will be discourage. What Matthew has provided for us is enough material to last our life time. There is just so much truth, so many spiritual gems and so much of the LORD in these passages. When he wrote his book on the Sermon on the Mount, Dr. Martin Lloyd Jones was compelled to use over 300 pages in his attempt to share its riches. Father Richard Rohr writing recently on the Sermon isn't quite as verbose but even he could not condense it to less than 200 pages. There is just so much here to read, to meditate on and to soak up The passage I would like for us to look at this morning is the one that we find after the Beatitudes. Now, if you have read our Lord's Beatitudes or have heard them then you know this morning that you could spend a whole week just looking at, studying and understanding them. As you read them you begin to see how Jesus desires for us as His followers to have a whole new vocabulary, a whole new vision and a whole new value and virtue system. He invites us to understand the true meaning of having a life blessed by His Heavenly Father. He invites us to understand the depth, the breath and the width of God's Kingdom. It's all rather amazing! I would like for us focus our attention on Matthew 5:13 -16. In this section our Lord uses a couple of wonderful little designations or symbols to help us understand what it means to be His disciple. He uses these symbols to reveal a part of what He sees as their identity and character. Both of these symbols (salt and light) are very expressive and underneath them is the foundational thought that they never exist for themselves. Salt does not exist for itself and light does not exist for itself. Both of these symbols speak of reaching out and of being a service to others and to our world at large. Pliny the Elder, a great Roman scholar and writer around the time of Jesus said this, ""For the whole body nothing is more beneficial than salt and sun."" (Natural History 31:102). It is with that same attitude that Jesus wants us to see ourselves as His salt and light. He wants us to understand that in the Kingdom of God and its global mission we are necessary, indispensible and beneficial."
John 2:1-10,"('Empty', 'Full Life', 'Full', 'Fullness Of Life', 'Made Whole')",Pentecostal," Full Pt. 1 - Pushing Past Empty I. Introduction It is a new year. Usually a new year is filled with expectations, resolutions, big plans, and anticipation. But, I also wonder how many would be honest enough to admit that in the back of our minds there is also some fear? I was excited last New Year's Day too and look how it turned out. I was making these same plans last year at this time and look where I still am 365 days later. So, try as you might your excitement is measured with past pain and disappointment. As we step onto the pages of unwritten 2017, I want to challenge you examine your own life and determine whether or not you are full. You ""fullness"" will determine what overflows to every area of your life. But why should we even expect to live a life of fullness? I take you back to the last verse that I began the last night we shared together in worship in 2016. Text: Isaiah 53:10 The plan was that he give himself as an offering for sin so that he'd see life come from it--life, life, and more life. (Message) John 10:10 The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance - to the full, till it overflows. (Amplified Version) Colossians 2:9-10 You don't need a telescope, a microscope, or a horoscope to realize the fullness of Christ, and the emptiness of the universe without him. When you come to him, that fullness comes together for you, too. His power extends over everything. For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form, and in Christ you have been brought to fullness. It is prophesied and then Jesus Himself owns up to His divine appointment. We say He came to save us and He did. We say He came to make a way for us to get to Heaven and He did. We say He came to bridge the gap to the Father and He did. But that is an incomplete understanding of His goal and role! The accurate and mature understanding is knowing that salvation was only part of the picture. He came to save but He also came to enable us to experience fullness in life! Paul says, ""in Christ we have been brought to fullness!"" And yet, in our first step into 2017 some of us are empty and so the idea of fullness seems like a fantasy and a fairytale. So let's take a moment and examine an instance in Jesus' life that I think speaks to where most of us are on this first day of a new year. John 2:1-10 Three days later there was a wedding in the village of Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there. Jesus and his disciples were guests also. When they started running low on wine at the wedding banquet, Jesus' mother told him, ""They're just about out of wine."" Jesus said, ""Is that any of our business, Mother--yours or mine? This isn't my time. Don't push me."" She went ahead anyway, telling the servants, ""Whatever he tells you, do it."" Six stoneware water pots were there, used by the Jews for ritual washings. Each held twenty to thirty gallons. Jesus ordered the servants, ""Fill the pots with water."" And they filled them to the brim. ""Now fill your pitchers and take them to the host,"" Jesus said, and they did.When the host tasted the water that had become wine he didn't know what had just happened but the servants, of course, knew, he called out to the bridegroom, ""Everybody I know begins with their finest wines and after the guests have had their fill brings in the cheap stuff. But you've saved the best till now!"""
Luke 17:11-19,"('Thankfulness', 'Full', 'Fullness Of Life', 'Being Thankful')",Pentecostal," Full Pt. 2 - Thank Full I. Introduction At the start of new year I have challenged you to examine your own life and determine whether or not you are full. Your ""fullness"" will determine what overflows to every area of your life. Our difficulty is that we will do our very best to fill anything that is empty . . . Space, time, relationships, etc. and unless we know what we should be full of then often our lives are crammed with clutter, the trivial and the unnecessary to the point that we have no room left for that which God intended to fill us. Make no mistake He does intend for us to be full! John 10:10 The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance - to the full, till it overflows. (Amplified Version) Colossians 2:9-10 You don't need a telescope, a microscope, or a horoscope to realize the fullness of Christ, and the emptiness of the universe without him. When you come to him, that fullness comes together for you, too. His power extends over everything. For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form, and in Christ you have been brought to fullness. The accurate and mature understanding is knowing that salvation was only part of the picture. He came to save but He also came to enable us to experience fullness in life! So I want to clearly state for us some of the things that should fill us so that we are able to experience this fullness that Jesus came to give us. Luke 17:11-19 (Message) It happened that as he made his way toward Jerusalem, he crossed over the border between Samaria and Galilee. As he entered a village, ten men, all lepers, met him. They kept their distance but raised their voices, calling out, ""Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"" Taking a good look at them, he said, ""Go, show yourselves to the priests."" They went, and while still on their way, became clean. One of them, when he realized that he was healed, turned around and came back, shouting his gratitude, glorifying God. He kneeled at Jesus' feet, so grateful. He couldn't thank him enough--and he was a Samaritan. Jesus said, ""Were not ten healed? Where are the nine? Can none be found to come back and give glory to God except this outsider?"" Then he said to him, ""Get up. On your way. Your faith has healed and saved you."" We must be thank full! Jesus goes out of His way - actually traveling to an off limits area for Jews - adjusts His travel route, detours, and breaks rules to bring a healing, life changing, hope restoring touch that changes a death sentence, terminal situation for 10 men. We can focus on the 9 that received this touch and continued with life and say that their actions and response is indicative and the most accurate picture of our society and unfortunately most of us as Jesus touched people. We find ourselves living in and often living like those around us - we are consumed by an attitude and position of entitlement which then leads to a lack of gratitude and thanklessness. Desperate for help, receive help and continue on our way. No pause. No hesitation. No gratitude. The unexpected . . . expected and demanded. However, I want us to only take enough time to view the 9 as a cautionary tale and instead focus our attention on the 1 who got it right."
Luke 2:41-49,"('Purpose', 'Full', 'Fullness Of Life', 'Our Purpose')",Pentecostal," Full Pt. 3 - Purpose Full I. Introduction Are you full? If so, what are you full of? Your ""fullness"" will determine what overflows to every area of your life. And yet the truth is that if we find ourselves closer to the ""e"" than the ""f"" we are in the majority. In a recent study of 1,000 churches and the spiritual growth of their congregation the researchers discovered that only 11% (or in other words 1 out of 10) would say they are compelled by their faith to love God and love others! 89% in the wilderness. Saved? Yes. Full? No! Emptiness reigns in the church community. However, I want to remind you and challenge you that God does intend for us to be full! John 10:10 The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance - to the full, till it overflows. (Amplified Version) Colossians 2:9-10 You don't need a telescope, a microscope, or a horoscope to realize the fullness of Christ, and the emptiness of the universe without him.

For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form, and in Christ you have been brought to fullness.

So I want to clearly state for us some of the things that should fill us so that we are able to experience this fullness that Jesus came to give us. Last time, I said we must be thank full. I want us to continue on this path to fullness. Luke 2:41-49 (NKJV) His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover. And when He was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast. When they had finished the days, as they returned, the Boy Jesus lingered behind in Jerusalem. And Joseph and His mother did not know it; but supposing Him to have been in the company, they went a day's journey, and sought Him among their relatives and acquaintances. So when they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking Him. Now so it was that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions. And all who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers. So when they saw Him, they were amazed; and His mother said to Him, ""Son, why have You done this to us? Look, Your father and I have sought You anxiously."" And He said to them, ""Why did you seek Me? Did you not know that I must be about My Father's business?"" Jesus teaches us that . . . We must be purpose full! You can read between the lines of this account and come to this conclusion . . . By the age of 12 Jesus already had a very clear understanding of who He was and what He was on this earth to do. In other words, Jesus was purpose full. Knowing His purpose meant that even at 12, while most of us are playing video games and worried about trying to fit into the clique and impress classmates we don't even like, Jesus was already on task. So, I want to stop for a moment and say to our youth . . . figure it out now. Don't buy the lie that you have to wait until you are 25 or 35 to figure it out because the truth is too many of us bought that lie and then have become so full of cares that we can't figure out our cause! We have become so consumed with other things that we are no longer consumed by purpose."
John 1:14-17,"('Grace', 'Full', 'Fullness Of Life', 'Graceful')",Pentecostal," Full Pt. 4 - Grace Full I. Introduction Are you full? If so, what are you full of?

Saved? Yes. Full? No! Emptiness reigns in the church community. However, I want to remind you and challenge you that God does intend for us to be full! I am going to continue to read these because they are promises that we must allow to come to life in our spirit - not just for my neighbor but for me. John 10:10 The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that _________ (insert your name) may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance - to the full, till it overflows.

For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form, and in Christ you have been brought to fullness.

So I want to clearly state for us some of the things that should fill us so that we are able to experience this fullness that Jesus came to give us. I have declared that we must be thank full and purpose full. I want us to continue on this path to fullness. John 1:14 (NIV) The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us. We have seen His glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. John makes it clear that when Jesus arrives on the scene that He is full of grace. That was apparent wasn't it? You can't read about the life of Jesus and not come to the conclusion that He was full of grace. I don't have the time to reflect or even draw your attention to all of the example of that but here are just a few. Woman caught in adultery. Others wanted to stone her He cleared her. The woman washing His feet. Others wanted to cast her out He offered entrance. The woman at the well. Others wanted to avoid her and He detoured to get to her. One of His 3 best friends deny Him. Turned his back on Him. Jesus hands Peter a mulligan. And perhaps one of the greatest examples is how Jesus dealt with the thief on the cross. Notice I said the ""thief"" on the cross. No question of guilt. All appeals had been exhausted. Delays by lawyers have expired. He was a crook. He was tried, convicted and sentenced. You might even be able to draw the conclusion that he was either a repeat offender or stole something so significant that he winds up on a cross. Yet, Jesus was so gracious that He extends entry into heaven to this criminal that cries out for mercy. Jesus' entire life and ministry was marked by grace. It seems Jesus always went out of His way to give grace."

I have declared that we must be thank full, purpose full, grace full. I want us to continue on this path to fullness. Luke 5:12-16 (NIV) One day in a certain village he was visiting, there was a man with an advanced case of leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell to the ground before him, face downward in the dust, begging to be healed. ""Sir,"" he said, ""if you only will, you can clear me of every trace of my disease."" Jesus reached out and touched the man (something no one else would do - instantly became by religious standard unclean and now at risk to develop same sickness - grace full) and said, ""Of course I will. Be healed."" And the leprosy left him instantly! Then Jesus instructed him to go at once without telling anyone what had happened and be examined by the Jewish priest. ""Offer the sacrifice Moses' law requires for lepers who are healed,"" he said. ""This will prove to everyone that you are well."" Now the report of his power spread even faster and vast crowds came to hear him preach and to be healed of their diseases. But he often withdrew to the wilderness for prayer. Incredible account but because of the mind boggling act of grace and the miracle that was produced we miss it. It almost comes off as an afterthought. But slow down and read the last verse again. But he often withdrew to the wilderness for prayer."
"Galatians 1:10-12, Galatians 5:1-4","('Grace', 'Baptism', 'Salvation', 'Gospel', 'Discipleship', 'Obedience', 'Faithfulness', 'Justification', 'Righteousness', 'Book Of Revelation', 'Traditions Of Men', 'Servants Of Christ', 'Falling From Grace', 'Saved By Faith Only')",Christian/Church Of Christ," INTRODUCTION Outline. 1. The Servants of Men - Pharisees 2. The Servants of Tradition - Patriarchs 3. The Servant of Christ - Paul Remarks. 1. In our lesson today we are going to be discussing the theme: ""Paul, the servant of Christ."" This lesson deals with Paul's work as the servant of Christ. 2. First, we will consider the servants of men, the Pharisees called also the Judaizers. There were men in the first century who were compelled to oppose the work of Paul. They were men of the Pharisees, known also as the ""men from James."" These men sought to thwart Paul's work among the Gentiles. And when they could not hinder the ""obedience of the Gentiles to the faith"" they sought to compel them to follow the Law of Moses and the custom of circumcision. They claim, the Gentiles were not fully saved and members of the kingdom of God until they have conformed to the Pharisees' requirements of faith, grace, circumcision and the Law of Moses. To which Paul violently opposed. 3. Second, we will discuss the servants of traditions, the Patriarchs the Fathers of the Jewish religion. Still yet another group was also against the gospel of Christ, and that was those that held to the traditions of the ""fathers."" Paul, like the other Jewish leaders were learned in the ""traditions of the father."" These traditions become more important to the Jews than the Law of Moses. It was to these men that Jesus spoke against during His personal ministry. Our Lord declared them to be ""hypocrites"" who held to the ""traditions of men over the commandments of God."" The church must always be on guard against such teachings and teachers. 4. Lastly, we will investigate the servant of Christ, the apostle Paul. He now states that he is the servant of Christ; and not the servant of men. Here he means that his message though abhorred by men, it is the message that God had ordained that he preach. It is the message of grace. The gospel that was preached among the Galatians, believed and obeyed. But now, these babes in Christ had strayed away from the truth as a result of teachers which sought to bring them into the bondage of the flesh. That is, circumcision and the Law of Moses. We might not face a doctrine as this today; but, any message other than the truth of the gospel of Christ, places the believers in jeopardy of ""falling from grace."" The servant of Christ proclaims the message of grace without addition or subtraction! This is the message of salvation, hope and eternal life. Let's consider our first thought - the servants of men, the Pharisees. BODY OF LESSON I THE SERVANTS OF MEN - PHARISEES A. I do not persuade men. Is this Paul's motive, to serve men or to please God? The man of God cannot seek to ""persuade men"" to follow a message other than the truth of the gospel. In some situation - men will desire to persuade you to be silent in preaching the truth. You must however stand firm in proclaiming the truth without alteration. This stand will cause you to be out of favor with men pleasers. Notice:"
"Hebrews 11:32-34, 2 Corinthians 12:7-10","('Healing', 'Apostle Paul', 'Heroes Of The Faith', 'Strength In Weakness')",Pentecostal," Our Weaknesses Can Strengthen Us Our theme this year is discovering your destiny, and today on this Healing and Wholeness Sunday we are specifically thinking about strength out of weakness. Strength out of weakness, sounds a little impossible doesn't it? How can something that makes us weak cause us to be strong? It sounds like a paradox, strength out of weakness, it is a phrase that at first may not seem to make a lot of sense, many in the world today would consider weakness as a problem, as something negative. My prayer is this morning that each of us will grasp how our weaknesses can actually strengthen us. Maybe you have come here this morning feeling drained, maybe there are problems, or situations or circumstances in your life that are causing you to feel weak. Maybe there is something going on in the life of someone you know that is causing distress. God can bring Healing and Wholeness into each of our lives today. The Bible teaches us that God is able to turn weakness to strength. What may seem impossible to us is possible for God, God can use our weaknesses to strengthen us. In the bible there are many examples of how God works in the lives of His people. People who in the eyes of the world, and even at times in their own eyes seemed weak, yet God accomplished great things in them and through them. When they seemed to be at their weakest, when the circumstances seemed impossible, when the odds were against them and the situation was grim, that was when God stepped in, that was when God acted, when God transformed, when God moved in miraculous ways, when God showed that weakness could be turned to strength. Need an example from God's Word? In Hebrews 11 we read these words: It would take too long to recount the stories of the faith of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and all the prophets. By faith these people overthrew kingdoms, ruled with justice, and received what God had promised them. They shut the mouths of lions, quenched the flames of fire, and escaped death by the edge of the sword. Their weakness was turned to strength. (Hebrews 11:32-34) Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David and Samuel. Heroes of the faith, people who accomplished great things, people who knew great blessing. But they were people who were not perfect, they had problems, they had situations, they had times of distress, times of pain, times of suffering, times of weakness. Yet see those words: Their weakness was turned to strength! God worked in them and through them, God changed and transformed them! God strengthened them and He can strengthen you and me this morning. These heroes of faith were not perfect, you and I are not perfect, we stumble, we make mistakes, circumstances affect us, situations bring us down, our sin damaged bodies experience illness and fatigue, but God can turn our weakness to strength, God can bring healing and wholeness to our lives. That was an example of people from Old Testament times, lets consider someone from the New Testament. Let's think about the Apostle Paul for a moment."
Ephesians 2:10,"(""God's Purposes"", ""God's Purpose"", 'Opportunities', 'Wasted Opportunities', 'Going Ahead Of God')",Pentecostal," Introduction Our lives matter to God. There is a purpose behind your existence... Ephesians 2: 10 tells us that there are good works which God prepared in advance for us to do. Those good works are God's plan and purpose for our lives; what He created us to do. God doesn't wait for you to be an adult before He starts thinking about what you can do for Him or how you can impact lives. He doesn't even wait until the day you become born again to decide what He wants to use you to do. David, Jeremiah, Isaiah and Paul all discovered that before they were born, God had a plan and purpose for their lives. In Psalm 139: 13, David said ""For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb"". In verse 16, he went on to say ""all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be"". So David discovered that long before he was even born, God had a plan for His life. God Himself specifically told Jeremiah in Jeremiah 1:4-5 that ""Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations"". Isaiah and Paul also got to understood that God had put in place a plan for their lives even before they were born. In Isaiah 49:1, Isaiah said ""Before I was born the Lord called me; from my birth he has made mention of my name"". While Paul in Galatians 1:15 said God set him apart from birth to preach Christ to the Gentiles. That purpose did not change even when men like Paul were persecuting Christians and going in a direction completely different from what God originally planned for His life. These were men who understood that they were created for a purpose and that understanding greatly affected how they spent their time here on earth. God's Purpose for Our Lives Is Actually the Reason Why We Are Alive Today I don't know how many of us have bothered to ask about the circumstances leading to our birth. For some of us, it's a wonder we are alive today because we have been through situations that ordinarily should have taken our lives. We have had some real near death experiences but somehow, through it all, God preserved our lives. Some people had actually tried at some point to even take their lives, but nothing happened. The overdose of drugs and various suicide attempts failed. There are even some of us that before we gave our lives to Christ, we were involved in all kinds of wild and dangerous things. You were drunk and drove into an electric pole, yet came out of that accident without even a scratch. God has been preserving our lives, saving us again and again from all kinds of dangers and attacks because of His plan and purpose for our lives. So it's not about you, that you are safety conscious person, or you know how to pray and fast very well, or because it has always been your desire to start your own business at 40 that's why God preserved you to see your 40 birthday. It's all about God and His purpose for our lives (2 Timothy 1:9). We are alive today because of the divine purpose behind our existence."
Revelation 10:1-11,"('Rainbow', 'Book Of Revelation', 'Little Book', 'Mighty Angel', 'Lion Roar')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 6-19-18 Title: The Angel with the Little Book (10:1-10:11) Revelation 10:1-11 (NIV) 1 And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire: 2 And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth, 3 And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. 4 And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not. 5 And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, 6 And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer: 7 But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets. 8 And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. 9 And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. 10 And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. 11 And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings. Introduction If you have been expecting the seventh angel to sound the seventh trumpet at this point, you are going to be disappointed. Between the breaking of the sixth and seventh seals we met with a sort of interlude. That Interlude (chapter 7) described how God remembers mercy in the midst of wrath and seals a host of Jews and Gentiles. We mentioned in that earlier study that another such parenthesis would appear between the six and seven trumpets. The passage before us (10:1-11:14) is that parenthesis. The sixth trumpet has already sounded, but the seventh trumpet does not sound until later (11:15). These interludes, or parentheses, are parts of the whole. They are not unconnected segments. As we begin our study, note that [5]John's position has suddenly changed from Heaven to earth; the Mighty Angel came down from heaven. This angel is not to be identified with any other angel previously mentioned; he is not one of the seven (Some Bible scholars claim that he is not Christ and that Christ is never an angel in Revelation). This is another angel described in glorious terms. Commentary ?"
Ruth 1:1-4:16,"('Blessing', 'Grandmother', 'Patience And Trust')",Baptist," A COMPROMISING MOTHER BECOMES A GODLY GRANDMOTHER A. HOW NAOMI COMPROMISED 1. She compromised her spiritual priorities. a. Did not continue in difficulties. ""A famine in the land"" (Ruth 1:1). b. Enticed by the well-watered plains of Moab (1:1). c. Left the Promised Land. ""Ephrathites of Bethlehem, Judah"" (1:2). 2. She compromised her commitment to the Lord. When Ruth, her daughter-in-law wanted to go with Naomi, she directed her to go back to her foreign god. ""Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law"" (1:15). 3. Naomi compromised her family influence. Naomi's son, Chilion, married outside the faith (1:4). 4. Naomi criticized God's provision for her. ""I went out full, and the Lord has brought me home again empty"" (1:21). B. NAOMI'S REPENTANCE SEEN IN HER ACTIONS 1. Naomi recognized God's punishment. Naomi recognized God's punishment. ""The Lord hath caused me to suffer, and the Almighty has sent me such tragedy"" (1:21, NLB). 2. Naomi's counsel toward family heritage. When Ruth ""happened"" on Boaz's field, Naomi said, ""Blessed be he of the Lord, who has not forsaken His kindness to the living and the dead! And Naomi said to her, This man is a relation of ours, one of our close relatives"" (2:20). 3. Naomi counseled toward redemption. ""Then Naomi her mother-in- law said unto her, 'My daughter, shall I not seek security for you, that it may be well with you?'"" (3:1). 4. Naomi counseled patience and trust. ""Then she (Naomi) said, 'Sit still, my daughter . . . for the man will not rest until he has concluded the matter this day'"" (3:18). C. THE BLESSING ON GRANDMOTHER NAOMI ""Then the women said to Naomi, 'Blessed be the Lord, who has not left you this day without a close relative; and may his name be famous in Israel! And may he be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him'"" (Ruth 4:14-15). 1. Naomi is given more importance in the Bible than Ruth. a. The women blessed Naomi (4:14). b. The child is recognized as ""kin"" to Naomi (4:14). c. Naomi had oversight for the child's care (4:16). 2. The child is identified with this grandmother (not father or grandfather). Note: legal line not through Naomi and Elimelach (4:21). 3. The child Obed would be famous in Israel. a. The word famous means, ""name is proclaimed widely."" b. Obed was the great grandfather of Daniel. c. Obed comes from two words, (1) Obadiah i.e., a worshipper of God, (2) ebed, i.e., servant. Obed was a true servant and worshipper of the Lord. 4. The child gave grandmother Naomi a purpose in life. a. Naomi had been a compromiser, but she became a woman of conviction. b. Naomi didn't have any hope. She told Ruth, ""Turn back, my daughters, go-for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have hope, if I should have a husband tonight and should also bear sons"" (1:12). But God gave her a new life. ""He (Obed) shall be unto thee, a restorer of life"" (4:15)."
John 13:1-30,"('Humility', 'Cleansing')",Baptist," A. INTRODUCTION 1. It was little known what Jesus did during the day, because it was the custom to do no work and prepare for the Passover. 2. Peter and John (new friendship) prepared for the meal. 3. How were the disciples prepared to face Passover and the cross? Sinful attitude. ""There was a rivalry among them (the disciples) as to which of them should be considered the greatest"" (Luke 22:24). 4. The cross did not surprise Jesus. ""Jesus knew that His hour had come that He should depart from this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world; He loved them to the end"" (John 13:1). B. THE LAST SUPPER (JOHN 13:1-30) 1. Servant symbol. ""Jesus laid aside His garments, took a towel and girded Himself . . .began to wash the disciples' feet"" (John 13:4-5). 2. Peter refused. ""If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me"" (John 13:8). 3. Spiritual lesson: a. The bath - Salvation. b. Washing of feet - daily cleansing. ""He that is bathed needs only to wash his feet"" (John 13:10). 4. Humility. ""If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet"" (John 13:14). 5. How did Jesus warn Judas? a. "". . . you are clean, but not all of you"" (John 13:10). Suggestion. b. ""He who eats bread with Me, has lifted up his heel against Me"" (John 13:18). Quote Scripture. If you have never really accepted Jesus as your personal Savior, would you do it right now? Do not delay or put it off. If you would like to receive Christ by faith, pray this simple prayer in your heart: Dear Lord, I acknowledge that I am a sinner. I believe Jesus died for my sins on the cross, and rose again the third day. I repent of my sins. By faith I receive the Lord Jesus as my Savior. You promised to save me, and I believe You, because You are God and cannot lie. I believe right now that the Lord Jesus is my personal Savior, and that all my sins are forgiven through His precious blood. I thank You, dear Lord, for saving me. In Jesus' name, Amen. If you prayed that prayer, God heard you and saved you. I personally want to welcome you to the family of God and rejoice with you. All PBC lessons are available online at trbc.org/pbc.

Ephesians 4:2-6,"('Community', 'Unity', 'Teamwork', 'Oneness Of Faith')",Baptist," Being a Team Player Ephesians 4:2-6 January 29, 2017 I love this picture! Look closely at the picture, each boat is rowing at the same speed, at the same rate. It's a great example of teamwork. We don't go canoeing very often. I do remember canoeing with my family and we had to remind one another of the need to row together - - so we could go straight or gain a little speed. It's not just a matter of coordination, it's a matter of utilizing team work. Team work is vitally important to any organization. Think about football players and their success. To be successful, you need the other players on the team to perform their jobs. This past Christmas, Dallas Cowboys running back, Ezekiel Elliot bought these John Deere Utility vehicles for his offensive line. They cost about $10,000 each. The most outrageous gift was by a guy most here love, Tom Brady, in 2008, he gave his offensive lineman Audi Q7 SUV's valued at $42,000 each!! Not to bad. There's lots of players who give great gifts, especially after they've had great seasons! Why do they do this? Brady wouldn't be as good as he is without a great offensive line - - - and Ezekiel Elliot wouldn't be the great rookie running back without his offensive line blocking well for him. It's the same in other areas of life. Whenever movie stars win an Oscar, they give the same basic speech: ""I would like to thank all the people who helped make this night possible -- my agent, my manager, my director, my producer, the writers, the members of the cast..."" and on and on. On July 20, 1969, when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, he was the focus of attention for the entire planet. Even today, his name is most associated with the moon voyage. His statement ""One small step for man..."" will never be forgotten. What is forgotten, is that the Apollo expedition succeeded because a large and committed team of individuals sacrificed day and night for years to make it happen. Neil Armstrong was only one of over 218,000 people who worked on the Apollo project. He received most of the recognition, but he would be the first to tell you - - it was a team effort. Remember the Challenger disaster, remember what the cause of the disaster was? An O-ring! It was a part which didn't cost much, yet because it didn't work properly, there was a disaster and 7 people died. That's the way it is with every area of life. Life is a team sport. God intends for us to work together in order to achieve success. One person cannot do it alone. And sometimes, when one person doesn't do what they need to do, we suffer as well. It's the same at church. Church is a team sport. In order to do the work God has called us to do, we must work together as a team -- though that is not the strategy most churches use. Too often, the strategy is to hire a ""professional"" (or group of professionals) to do the work of the ministry for the people, who are the recipients of ministry. That's not the Biblical model. The Bible tells us God's method in Ephesians 4 ~ 11 It was He who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers,"

Revelation 4:1-11,"(""John's Vision"", 'Heavenly Throne')",Baptist," I. Introduction A. Turn to Revelation 4:1 Revelation 4:1-2 After this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open in heaven. And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, ""Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this."" (2) At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it. 1. John saw a vision a. and this morning we are going to zero in on the vision of the throne and the person on that throne b. Five things happen in rapid succession (1) First, there was a door, standing open before John (a) This is the third door mentioned in the Revelation i) The first was the door Christ opened before the church at Philadelphia a) Which was the door to evangelization and missions - that door is still open to us!! ii) The second was the door to the Laodician church that Christ was knocking upon a) Christ is still standing there knocking, hoping to be allowed to enter into many of these local churches and institutions today (b) This third door was opened to John and it is the door to the Revelation of Jesus Christ i) This door is open to all who are indwelt by the Holy Spirit ii) The main difference is that today, the door lies in the Word of God iii) The Holy Spirit illuminates these revealed truths to our hearts (2) Second, a commanding voice calls to John (a) This is the same voice that John heard in the beginning of the Revelation Revelation 1:10 On the Lord's Day I was in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet, (b) And here, ""And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said,"" (3) Third, the voice said, ""Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this."" (a) I pointed out two Sundays ago that the voice is telling John that the things he would see are those things which must, of necessity, happen, because they are divinely decreed to happen (4) Fourth, John is immediately in the Spirit, in heaven. (a) Paul describes an experience much the same, however, he did not know whether his experience was a vision or he actually went into heaven 2 Corinthians 12:2 I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven. (b) John seems to realize that his experience is a very real vision (5) The fifth thing that happens is John sees a throne and some one sitting upon it. c. The vision that John has of God is quite obviously symbolic (1) Moses asked to see God's face and was told that no man could see God and live (2) Moses was allowed to see a vision of God's back and it effected Him tremendously (a) Moses face shown with God's reflected glory for quite a while after his experience (3) But, being symbolic, there is a great revelation here if we will seek to see the significance of the symbols (a) This morning we are going to explore the symbol's revelation of God Almighty II. Body A. The very first symbol John mentions is the throne"
Revelation 5:1-14,"('Redemption',)",Baptist," I. Introduction A. Turn to Revelation 5:1 Revelation 5:1 Then I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals. 1. First we have to remember that the scene is the same as the one in Revelation 4 a. John is in the Spirit, in heaven b. He saw God Almighty upon His throne (1) The supreme majesty of the universe (2) Surrounded by the 24 representative elders c. Then, in this first verse of chapter 5 (1) John sees a scroll in the right hand of God (2) We must remember that the right hand is the hand of power and the hand of honor d. The King of creation, God the Father, Jehovah is sitting holding out this scroll which is sealed with seven seals 2. We must now pause and ask ourselves, what is this scroll? a. The scroll is written on both sides (1) The inside (2) And outside b. We can find part of our answer to the significance of the scroll in Jeremiah 32 (1) Starting with the 7th verse Jeremiah 32:7-17 Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle is going to come to you and say, 'Buy my field at Anathoth, because as nearest relative it is your right and duty to buy it.' (8) ""Then, just as the LORD had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard and said, 'Buy my field at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. Since it is your right to redeem it and possess it, buy it for yourself.' ""I knew that this was the word of the LORD; (9) so I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel and weighed out for him seventeen shekels of silver. (10) I signed and sealed the deed, had it witnessed, and weighed out the silver on the scales. (11) I took the deed of purchase--the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions, as well as the unsealed copy-- (12) and I gave this deed to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel and of the witnesses who had signed the deed and of all the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard. (13) ""In their presence I gave Baruch these instructions: (14) 'This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Take these documents, both the sealed and unsealed copies of the deed of purchase, and put them in a clay jar so they will last a long time. (15) For this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Houses, fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land.' (16) ""After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD: (17) ""Ah, Sovereign LORD, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too hard for you. (2) When a Jew was unable to pay his debts, the Lord made provisions for relief (a) The man could sell his land and himself (b) When the land was sold, two parchments were prepared i) In these parchments was detailed the terms of the land sale ii) In the Sabbath year, the man was to be released from his servitude and the land was returned to him iii) However, if the man was able to repay his debt before the sabbath year, he was freed and the land returned"
John 5:1-15,"('Bible', 'Kjv', 'Bible Translations', 'Missing Bible Verses', 'The Holy Bible')",Nazarene," John 5:1-15 (Please open your Bibles to this passage.) This passage is the account of Jesus' healing of the lame man at the pool of Bethesda; an account which only appears in the Gospel of John. Many Bible scholars (a person can be a Bible scholar without being a Bible believer ...) believed that the pool of Bethesda never existed. Those who doubted the truth of the account believed that John invented the story to embellish the story of Jesus. Why? To make Him look greater than just another prophet? To make a prophet into the Son of God? In other words, to create a God where one doesn't really exist? However, in the very late 1800's an excavation was started in Jerusalem near the ancient sheep gate and guess what they found! The pool of Bethesda right where the Bible said it would be! So, let's go ahead and read John 5:1-15 and today I'll be reading from the NIrV which is a variation of the NIV and is specifically for those who perhaps have limited reading skills. --- Reading from NIrV Translation ------------------------------------------------------------ Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish feasts. In Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate is a pool. In the Aramaic language it is called Bethesda. It is surrounded by five rows of columns with a roof over them. Here a great number of disabled people used to lie down. Among them were those who were blind, those who could not walk, and those who could hardly move. One person was there who had not been able to walk for 38 years. Jesus saw him lying there. He knew that the man had been in that condition for a long time. So He asked him, ""Do you want to get well?"" ""Sir,"" the disabled man replied, ""I have no one to help me into the pool when an angel stirs up the water. I try to get in, but someone else always goes down ahead of me."" Then Jesus said to him, ""Get up! Pick up your mat and walk."" The man was healed right away. He picked up his mat and walked. This happened on a Sabbath day. So the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, ""It is the Sabbath day. The law does not allow you to carry your mat."" But he replied, ""The One who made me well said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.' "" They asked him, ""Who is this fellow? Who told you to pick it up and walk?"" The one who was healed had no idea who it was. Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there. Later Jesus found him at the temple. Jesus said to him, ""See, you are well again. Stop sinning, or something worse may happen to you."" The man went away. He told the Jewish leaders it was Jesus who had made him well. --- End of Reading from NIrV Translation ------------------------------------------------------------ Now, I do not know what translation you were reading from but if you were reading from a relatively modern translation the second half of the third verse and all of the fourth verse are left out, bracketed or footnoted but are found in other Bibles."
Acts 2:1-47,"('Baptism', 'Holy Spirit Baptism', 'Day Of Pentecost')",Baptist," TITLE: The Spirit Falls TEXT: Acts 2 INTRO: Acts chapter 2 tells us what happened to the Disciples on the day of Pentecost. Pentecost means fiftieth"" and refers to the feast of weeks , which was celebrated 50 days after Passover. At Pentecost the Jews celebrated the giving of the law. Now, we see the church given the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. I. THE WAITING (v.1) A. Waiting for the Promise 1. The disciples were not cowering in fear, but waiting for God's direction -In one place -In one accord 2. They were doing what Jesus told them to do (Act 1:4-5 ESV) ""And while staying with them he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, ""you heard from me; for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now."" B. Waiting is Not Time Wasted 1. If we run ahead of God, then our efforts will be wasted 2. We need inspiration from God (Pro 3:6 KJV) In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. 3. We need to receive God's power for the task at hand (Isa 40:31 ESV) ""but they who wait for the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint."" II. THE WONDER (v.2-3) A. The Sound of a Roaring Wind 1. In both the Hebrew and Greek languages, the word for spirit (as in Holy Spirit) is the same word for breath or wind. 2. When Adam was created, he wasn't alive until God breathed life into Him (Gen 2:7 KJV) And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. 3. The word Inspiration literally means ""God breathed"" (2Ti 3:16 KJV) All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: B. The Cloven Tongues of Fire 1. Rested upon each one of them 2. A symbol of purification, as a refiner uses fire to make pure gold. 3. The filling of the Holy Spirit is not just for abstract power, but for purity. C. For All Believers 1. All who believe in Christ receive the Holy Spirit at the moment of salvation (Gal 3:2 KJV) This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 2. The Holy Spirit Dwells in the Believer (Rom 8:9 KJV) But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. III. THE WORD (vs. 4-8) A. The Gift of Tongues 1. For the Purpose of Sharing the Gospel with everyone (Act 2:4 KJV) And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. 2. A special gift for the early church (1Co 13:8 ESV) Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. B. Peter's Sermon (vs. 14-47) 1. Tells the crowd that had gathered that the disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit"
"Matthew 24:3, Mark 13:3-4","('Perseverance', 'Never Quit', 'Jesus Is Coming Soon')",Assembly Of God," WHEN? DO WE KNOW THE TIMES AND SEASONS?... WE CAN'T QUIT... By Wade Martin Hughes, Sr. Kyfingers@aol.com Matthew 24:3 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? We had a beautiful cuckoo clock that my older brother sent us from Germany. It hung on the wall and announced the hours by making sounds of a cuckoo's call to tell what time it was... ONCE THE HANDS ON THE CLOCK GOT MESSED UP--- THE CUCKOO LIED TO US, until we learned how to pop the hand off and place it back where it should have been. We would stop and count as CUCKOO would sing. One day the cuckoo bird sang until it was horse... It sang 32 times: I SAID: LINDA IT IS 32, IT IS LATER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN BEFORE... I HAVE MANY PEOPLE I GREATLY RESPECT... ONE OF THOSE MEN I RESPECT FROM THE TWENTIETH CENTURY IS: MAHATMA GANDHI... Several stories have made an impression in my heart. I read once that Mahatma Gandhi attended a church in Northern Africa. Gandhi had read about Jesus' teachings and he loved the words of Christ, especially involving the philosophy of peaceful nonviolent resistance. He had studied the teaching of ""TURNING THE OTHER CHEEK."" So Gandhi had the opportunity of attending a Christian Church while on a visit to Africa. Some of the white people saw Gandhi enter the church and assumed he was black. Several asked him ""TO LEAVE AND NEVER COME BACK!"" Wow, how mean and anti-Christian can you be? I understand Gandhi never returned to a church again. I read once, Gandhi was traveling and the train was pulling out of the station as he boarded. As he was running along side the train his sandal fell off. So he bent down and quickly pulled off his other sandal and threw in down beside the train. Someone asked him: WHY DID YOU DO THAT? Gandhi said: SOME POOR PERSON WILL FIND THE SANDAL THE I LOST, SO I WANT THEM TO HAVE THE PAIR. Gandhi was an important leader in a difficult time in India. He was loved by his people and by those around the world. A POOR MOTHER approached Gandhi --- HER SON WAS IN VERY POOR HEALTH AND WAS OVERWEIGHT. This mother walked all day with her son to seek Gandhi's help. Gandhi enquired: HOW CAN I HELP YOU? With tears running down her face she said: MR. GANDHI, MY SON IS ADDICTED TO SUGAR AND IT IS KILLING HIM. COULD YOU PLEASE ASK MY SON TO STOP EATING SUGAR IN EXCESS? HE WILL LISTEN TO YOU! Gandhi looked at the mother and asked her: COME BACK IN A WEEK? So one week later the Mother brought her son to Gandhi to speak with her son about his addiction to sugar. The Mother asked Gandhi: WHY COULD YOU NOT SPEAK TO MY SON LAST WEEK? Gandhi replied: UP TO LAST WEEK I, TOO, ATE TOO MUCH SUGAR. NOW I CAN SPEAK WITH HIM. A GOOD LEARNER MUST LEARN TO ASK QUESTIONS. WE ARE TOLD THERE ARE SEVERAL QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWER IN AN ACCURATE REPORT? WHO? WHAT? WHEN? WHERE? WHY? APPEARS THYE DISCIPLES KNEW THE WHO? AND THE WHAT? THEY WERE CONCERNED WITH THE WHEN? Mark 13:3 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James"
1 Peter 3:13-18,"('Christian Witness', 'Being Prepared')",Baptist," TITLE: Always Ready TEXT: 1Peter 3:13-23 CONCL: A Romanian pastor was captured and tortured in order to get him to tell where other Christians were meeting so they could be arrested as well. But they could not get the pastor to break and disclose the location of the other Christians. So, the authorities went and found the pastor's 14-year-old son and brought him to the prison. Then, in front of the pastor, they beat and tortured his son.After taking as much as he could, the pastor called out to his son and said, ""I love you my son. I must tell them what they want to know."" But, the son called back, ""No, father. They may kill me. But do not do me the disgrace of giving me a traitor for a father."" We are living in days of fear. It is similar to the time in which Peter wrote to the Christians in Rome to strengthen their faith and prepare them to be witnesses for Jesus. I. BE SANCTIFIED (vs.13-15a) A. To Sanctify Means to Set Apart (15a) ""But sanctify the Lord Jesus Christ in your hearts..."" 1. If you are a Christian, you should set apart Jesus Christ as Lord of your heart! 2. That means that He is boss 3. It means He is in charge. 4. It means He is worshiped and adored. 5. It means He can direct our thoughts, words and actions B. Preparing to Face Persecution (vs.13-14) 1. Jesus said we would face persecution 2. It is an honor to suffer for Jesus rather than for wrong # Someone asked C.S. Lewis, ""Why do the righteous suffer?"" ""Why not?"" he replied. ""They're the only ones who should be able to take it."" 4. Whatever happens, we can overcome (1Jn 4:4) Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. II. BE READY (vs.15b-17) A. When People Ask Questions, (15b) ""And be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason..."" 1. Suppose one day, someone asked you, ""How do I become a Christian?"" Would you be able to tell them? 2. You can't share something you don't possess B. Remember, the World is Bound for Hell 1. We are surrounded by people who do not believe in the Bible, Christ, or the Church 2. Jesus loved the lost and we should love them enough to tell them about Jesus III. BE HOPEFUL (vs.15c-18) A. We Have a Hope Others Don't Have (15c) ""...of the hope that is in you..."" 1. Our hope is in Jesus # My hope is built on nothing less Than Jesus' blood and righteousness. I dare not trust the sweetest frame, But wholly trust in Jesus' Name. 2. We are overcomers (Joh 16:33) These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world B. We Don't Cower in Fear 1. In the Middle Ages many Christians retreated to monasteries & lived apart from the world. 2. We are in the world, but not part of it, (Joh 15:18-19) If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you."
1 Peter 3:1-12,"('Marriage', 'Family Relationships')",Baptist," TITLE: Living in Relationship TEXT: 1Peter 3:1-12 INTRO: A marriage counselor was talking to a wife who was having difficulties with her husband. The counselor said, ""Maybe your problem is that you've been waking up grumpy in the morning."" ""No,"" she said. ""I always let him sleep late!."" It is difficult to find examples of good marriages in the Bible. But here are a few: -Adam & Eve before they sinned -Abraham & Sarah before Hagar -Solomon & his Shulamite bride before all his other women -Mary & Joseph, and -Aquila & Priscilla In the previous chapter, Peter talked about following Christ's example (1Pe 2:21) ""For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow His steps. "" In our lesson today, he gives some practical counsel on how to follow Jesus' footsteps . I. FOR THE WIVES (vs.1-6) A. Her Lifestyle (vs.1-2) 1. Voluntary subjection, by an equal, not forced 2. The purpose is to bring her unbelieving husband to Christ by the way she lives her life 3. It never means submission to abuse # I have actually advised wives who were being abused to move out to a safe place. B. Her Appearance (vs. 3-4) 1. What people see on the outside affects their estimation of what's in your heart. 2. Real beauty comes from within II. FOR THE HUSBANDS (v. 7) A. Likewise -Peter uses the term ""likewise"" for both husband & wife. It means ""in the same way"" and it refers back to Christ's example in chapter 2. B. His Behavior The ESV makes it plain (1Pe 3:7 ESV) Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered. 1. Understand, she is a beautiful & delicate treasure and treat her sol 2. Christian husbands & wives are both children of God 3. The way you treat your wife reveals who you are 4. If you don't honor your wife, your prayers will not be heard. III. FOR ALL BELIEVERS (vs. 8-12) A. Being of One Mind 1. Differences of opinion should not divide us 2. Care about one another and help one another 3. A Christian should always be courteous (Philippians 2:5-6 Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, B. We are Different from the World 1. We must not harbor resentment 2 As Christ forgave us, we must forgive others 3. Evil words should never come from our mouths 4. We must avoid evil, but do what is good 5. Jesus is the ""Prince of Peace"" & His peace should characterize our lives. C. God Sees & Knows What We Do 1. You can win an argument but lose your witness 2. God hears our prayers but He is against evil, whether its in the world or in our lives. CONCL: We have to take personal responsibility for obeying God. We shouldn't expect others to change while we stay the same. Amen"
Job 41:1-34,"('Leviathan', 'Beast From Without', 'Made Without Fear', 'Children Of Pride')",Calvary Chapel," Job 41: 1 - 34 The Enemy From Without 1 ""Can you draw out Leviathan with a hook, or snare his tongue with a line which you lower? 2 Can you put a reed through his nose, or pierce his jaw with a hook? 3 Will he make many supplications to you? Will he speak softly to you? 4 Will he make a covenant with you? Will you take him as a servant forever? 5 Will you play with him as with a bird, or will you leash him for your maidens? 6 Will your companions make a banquet of him? Will they apportion him among the merchants? 7 Can you fill his skin with harpoons, or his head with fishing spears? 8 Lay your hand on him; remember the battle--never do it again! 9 Indeed, any hope of overcoming him is false; shall one not be overwhelmed at the sight of him? 10 No one is so fierce that he would dare stir him up. Who then is able to stand against Me? 11 Who has preceded Me, that I should pay him? Everything under heaven is Mine. 12 ""I will not conceal his limbs, his mighty power, or his graceful proportions. 13 Who can remove his outer coat? Who can approach him with a double bridle? 14 Who can open the doors of his face, with his terrible teeth all around? 15 His rows of scales are his pride, shut up tightly as with a seal; 16 One is so near another that no air can come between them; 17 They are joined one to another, they stick together and cannot be parted. 18 His sneezing flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. 19 Out of his mouth go burning lights; sparks of fire shoot out. 20 Smoke goes out of his nostrils, as from a boiling pot and burning rushes. 21 His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth. 22 Strength dwells in his neck, and sorrow dances before him. 23 The folds of his flesh are joined together; they are firm on him and cannot be moved. 24 His heart is as hard as stone, even as hard as the lower millstone. 25 When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid; Because of his crashing they are beside themselves. 26 Though the sword reaches him, it cannot avail; nor does spear, dart, or javelin. 27 He regards iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood. 28 The arrow cannot make him flee; Sling stones become like stubble to him. 29 Darts are regarded as straw; He laughs at the threat of javelins. 30 His undersides are like sharp potsherds; He spreads pointed marks in the mire. 31 He makes the deep boil like a pot; He makes the sea like a pot of ointment. 32 He leaves a shining wake behind him; One would think the deep had white hair. 33 On earth there is nothing like him, which is made without fear. 34 He beholds every high thing; He is king over all the children of pride."" In our last study we came across a monstrosity called Behemoth. In our study we discovered that this beast represents the satanic twist that we all labor with and struggle against in our own lives which the Bible calls the flesh, the fallen nature within us - our humanity - with its continual desire to assert it and live for it. The second sizeable obstacle which we will look at in this study represents the world in all its vast influence upon every one of us, pressuring us to conform, to reflect the values and attitudes of those around us, dominating all our thinking and all our life in every possible way. Behind them both is the devil, with his malevolent, cunning wisdom and power, incredible in his might and his control of human events."
Job 42:1-17,"('Job', 'I Abhor Myself')",Calvary Chapel," Job 42: 1 - 17 You'll Love The Ending 1 Then Job answered the LORD and said: 2 ""I know that You can do everything, and that no purpose of Yours can be withheld from You. 3 You asked, 'Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge?' Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know. 4 Listen, please, and let me speak; You said, 'I will question you, and you shall answer Me.' 5 ""I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees You. 6 Therefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes."" 7 And so it was, after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, that the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, ""My wrath is aroused against you and your two friends, for you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has. 8 Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, go to My servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and My servant Job shall pray for you. For I will accept him, lest I deal with you according to your folly; because you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has."" 9 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the LORD commanded them; for the LORD had accepted Job. 10 And the LORD restored Job's losses when he prayed for his friends. Indeed the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before. 11 Then all his brothers, all his sisters, and all those who had been his acquaintances before, came to him and ate food with him in his house; and they consoled him and comforted him for all the adversity that the LORD had brought upon him. Each one gave him a piece of silver and each a ring of gold. 12 Now the LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; for he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and one thousand female donkeys. 13 He also had seven sons and three daughters. 14 And he called the name of the first Jemimah, the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-Happuch. 15 In all the land were found no women so beautiful as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers. 16 After this Job lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his children and grandchildren for four generations. 17 So Job died, old and full of days. How many times have you talked with someone about a movie you might be interested in seeing. I think we have all experienced this where the person who we are talking with tells us that they do not want to spoil it for us by telling us about the film. Yet, in addition, to this remark, on some occasions, they have commented that 'You will love the ending.' In the book of Ecclesiastes 7:8 we read this, ""The end of a thing is better than its beginning; the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit"". Our Bibles reveal a similar story. Our Holy and Great God created the heavens, the earth, and all that is in them in six days. In reviewing His Creation He said that what He saw was 'Good', and 'Very Good'. Then in His Awesome Grace and Kindness He went up to Adam and said, 'My son, all this I give to you."" All this good stuff was covered in just two chapters. So, as you know he disobeyed our Holy Maker. In His Love for us our Master then set out to right the wrongs that were done so that we could again have a fellowship and relationship with Him. We learn through 40 selected individuals writing through His guidance how all this came about. The significance for us was the realization that in order for this to happen there must be a blood sacrifice. There is no forgiveness without the shedding of blood. Since we could not do it on our own, our Lord designated an innocent substitute which was lamb. However, this only served as a temporary forgiveness. To complete this requirement once and for all our Loving and Holy God came to earth and paid the price of our sins by volunteering to give His life for us at the cross. So, when we now get to the final chapters of the book of Revelation, because of His shed blood and death on the cross and resurrection we can rejoice that the end is Great!"
Hebrews 10:1-22,"('Forgiveness', 'Gift Of Salvation', 'Forgiveness Of Sin')",Assembly Of God," What Jesus accomplished on the cross If you can grasp the significance of what Christ accomplished for you in His Death on the Cross, your life will never be the same. That single revelation will open you up to a whole new world of limitless possibilities. You will have a new energy and life driving to make a difference in this world. My prayer is that as you read this, you would see for yourself how Jesus' death means a whole new life on a whole new level for you. SO WHAT DID CHRIST'S DEATH ACCOMPLISH? No1. To absorb the wrath of God God's law demanded, ""You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might"" (Deuteronomy 6:5). But we have all loved other things more. This is what sin is--dishonoring God by preferring other things over him, and acting on those preferences. The seriousness of an insult rises with the dignity of the one insulted. Since our sin is against the Ruler of the Universe, ""the wages of sin is death"" (Romans 6:23). Not to punish it would be unjust. So God sent his own Son, Jesus, to divert sin's punishment from us to himself. God ""loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation""--the wrath-absorbing substitute--""for our sins"" (1 John 4:10). Then God publicly endorsed Christ's accomplishment by raising him from the dead, proving the success of his suffering and death. No2. So that we would be free from the curse of the law There was no escape from the curse of God's law. It was just; we were guilty. There was only one way to be free: someone must pay the penalty. ""Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us"" (Galatians 3:13). The law's demands have been fulfilled by Christ's perfect law-keeping, its penalty fully paid by his death. This is why the Bible teaches that getting right with God is not based on law-keeping: ""A person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ"" (Galatians 2:16). Our only hope is having the blood and righteousness of Christ credited to our account. No 3. To reconcile us to God The reconciliation that needs to happen between man and God goes both ways. God's first act in reconciling us to himself was to remove the obstacle that separated him from us-- sin and the guilt of our sin. He took the steps we could not take to remove his own judgment by sending Jesus to suffer in our place: ""While we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son"" (Romans 5:10). Reconciliation from our side is simply to receive what God has already done, the way we receive an infinitely valuable gift. When we accept Jesus as our Savior, we receive salvation and forgiveness. But that's not all. The Bible says we also receive justification, redemption, reconciliation, atonement, propitiation, and regeneration. Each of these theological terms expresses wonderful truths about the blessing we receive when Jesus becomes our Savior."
Luke 2:22-40,"('Poor', 'Vulnerable', 'Turtledoves', 'Poor Offering', 'Suffering Christ')",Catholic," Feast of the Purification/Presentation 2017 Joy of the Gospel I have a special affection for this feast, which celebrates the bringing of Jesus to the Temple forty days after His birth, because I was baptized on this day seventy years ago. It is called Candlemas, because a procession with candles is often done to symbolize the going up of the Holy Family from Bethlehem to Jerusalem for the offering and prayers. As I get older, also, I find myself in a kind of solidarity with Simeon and Anna, who are remembered because of their faith in the God of Israel, who rewarded that faith by showing them the Messiah before their deaths. The poverty of the Holy Family is highlighted by the Scripture today. The sacrifice Joseph and Mary made for her purification and in celebration of their child's birth was the sacrifice of poor families who could not afford a lamb. St. Luke is being very theological here. Jesus made Himself poor so that we could become rich with the wealth of God's grace. Moreover, He was the true Lamb of sacrifice. Mary, who conceived and gave birth as a virgin, and Queen Mother, needed no purification. Finally, the offering of turtle doves brings to mind the union of heaven and earth symbolized in the Song of Songs. It's an awesome story that has that scary prophecy from Simeon about the revolution that Jesus would bring to the earth, and the sword that would break open the Blessed Virgin's heart. The Holy Father continues in his own musings on our responsibility to the poor: 'Jesus, the evangelizer par excellence and the Gospel in person, identifies especially with the little ones (cf. Mt 25:40). This reminds us Christians that we are called to care for the vulnerable of the earth. But the current model, with its emphasis on success and self-reliance, does not appear to favour an investment in efforts to help the slow, the weak or the less talented to find opportunities in life. 'It is essential to draw near to new forms of poverty and vulnerability, in which we are called to recognize the suffering Christ, even if this appears to bring us no tangible and immediate benefits. I think of the homeless, the addicted, refugees, indigenous peoples, the elderly who are increasingly isolated and abandoned, and many others. Migrants present a particular challenge for me, since I am the pastor of a Church without frontiers, a Church which considers herself mother to all. For this reason, I exhort all countries to a generous openness which, rather than fearing the loss of local identity, will prove capable of creating new forms of cultural synthesis. How beautiful are those cities which overcome paralysing mistrust, integrate those who are different and make this very integration a new factor of development! How attractive are those cities which, even in their architectural design, are full of spaces which connect, relate and favour the recognition of others! 'I have always been distressed at the lot of those who are victims of various kinds of human trafficking. How I wish that all of us would hear God's cry: ""Where is your brother?"" (Gen 4:9). Where is your brother or sister who is enslaved? Where is the brother and sister whom you are killing each day in clandestine warehouses, in rings of prostitution, in children used for begging, in exploiting undocumented labour? Let us not look the other way. There is greater complicity than we think. The issue involves everyone! This infamous network of crime is now well established in our cities, and many people have blood on their hands as a result of their comfortable and silent complicity.'"
Ephesians 1:7-10,"('Grace', 'Forgiveness', 'Redemption', 'Blessings')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Scripture We are currently in a series of sermons on Ephesians 1 that I am calling, ""God's Supreme Purpose."" The Apostle Paul's emphasis in chapter 1 is not on what we must do for salvation, but rather on what God has done for us in Christ. Ephesians 1:3-14 shows us how each Person of the Trinity is involved in the salvation of God's people. Our salvation was planned by the Father (1:4-6), purchased by the Son (1:7-12), and sealed by the Holy Spirit (1:13-14). Last time we examined the Father's plan of salvation in Ephesians 1:4-6. Today, we shall examine how our salvation was purchased by the Son in Ephesians 1:7-10. Let's read about how our salvation was purchased by the Son in Ephesians 1:7-10: 7 In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, 8 which he lavished upon us, in all wisdom and insight 9 making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ 10 as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth. (Ephesians 1:7-10) Introduction Dr. Bryan Chapell tells the story about an author who was interviewed on National Public Radio. He described his experience in a New York subway. A reasonably dressed, but apparently disturbed man walked through the crowd, pointing to individuals and addressing them with these words: ""You're in, you're out."" There was no apparent rhyme or reason to the choosing. One chosen to be ""in"" might be poorly or well dressed, black or white, male or female. Sometimes two or three in a row would be ""in"" and then abruptly someone else would be ""out."" ""You're in, you're in, you're in, you're out."" The crazed man making choices for no reason at all neared the author, whose heart involuntarily began to pound and his breath quickened in anticipation of the coming choice. It was silly. Apart from the potential danger of the crazed man, there was nothing to gain or to lose in being chosen. There was no competition to be won, no qualification to be met. Who cared if you were a loser in this game? The man came still closer, pointing a finger at young or old without distinction: ""You're in, you're out."" Finally, he came to the author, pointed a finger at his chest and said, ""You're in."" The author said later that he could not help feeling a sort of euphoria. He was among the chosen. Chosen for what? He did not know. He knew it was senseless to be proud of being so chosen, but he couldn't help but feel that there was some privilege earned, some approval gained, or some reward deserved now that he was among the chosen. He felt special for being chosen, but at the same time he felt silly for appreciating such a distinction that had no apparent benefits. The Bible teaches that each Person of the Trinity was involved in the salvation of sinful men and women. The Father planned that he would choose a vast number of people to salvation, the Son came to earth to purchase their salvation by his life, death, and resurrection, and then the Holy Spirit applied that salvation to the elect by enabling them to believe the gospel. Last week we examined the Father's role in our salvation, which was primarily that of election. Today, we shall examine the Son's role in our salvation. We shall see that there are blessings that flow to believers from God's election of us."
Revelation 11:1-13,"('Temple', 'Holy City', 'Bottomless Pit', 'Two Witnesses')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 7-4-16 Lesson: III.C.9.b: The Two Witnesses and Destruction of Jerusalem (11:1-13) Revelation 11:1-13 (KJV) 1 And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein. 2 But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months. 3 And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth. 4 These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth. 5 And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed. 6 These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will. 7 And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them. 8 And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified. 9 And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves. 10 And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth. 11 And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them. 12 And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them. 13 And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven. Introduction In the first 14 verses, chapter 11 continues with the interlude between the sixth and seventh trumpets, and in the concluding verses, we have this blowing of the seventh trumpet. In this chapter we learn that 42 months remain of the Times of the Gentiles and that there are two witnesses who will prophesy for 42 months. We also have the second woe and then the blowing of the seventh trumpet. This chapter brings us back to Old Testament ground. The temple, the dealing with time periods, and the distinction which is made between Jews and Gentiles all indicate that we are again under the Old Testament economy (beliefs and methods). Chronologically, the seventh trumpet brings us to the return of Christ at the end of the Great Tribulation Period."
"Philippians 3:17-21, John 10:10, Joshua 24:15","('Citizenship', 'Choices In Life')",Christian/Church Of Christ," MELVIN NEWLAND, MINISTER RIDGE CHAPEL, KANSAS, OK (PowerPoints used with this message are available for free. Just email me at mnewland@sstelco.com and request #309.) TEXT: Philippians 3:17 21; Joshua 24:15; John 10:10 As most of us are well aware there has been a lot of talk during this election season about media bias. And now that the election is over it is obvious that some in the media are upset about the election results. Well, it is not my intention to talk about any of that this morning. But I do want to remind you that efforts to ask ""gotcha"" questions are not new at all. ILL. For example, back in 1988 Dan Quayle was selected as the vice-presidential running mate of George H.W. Bush. Within hours of that announcement he faced the most intense media questioning of his life. One of the ""gotcha"" questions, & his answer, not only dominated the news reports of that press conference, but was used to dog his steps the entire time he was the Vice-President of the United States. The question was that while the Viet Nam war was going on why did he enlist in the National Guard & thus avoided the draft. He could have answered that legally he had the right to make that choice & was within his rights in doing so. But instead of defending himself that way, he candidly replied, ""I didn't know back then that I'd be standing before you today."" In other words, ""If I had known back then what I know now, I would have made a different choice."" Many people have echoed that same cry, ""If only I had known, I would have done things differently than I did."" ILL. Lyle Alzado, a star player on the Super Bowl 18 Champion Oakland Raiders team, died at age 43. He was convinced that his use of steroids during his football career had caused the brain cancer that was destroying him, & he warned fellow athletes to stay away from steroids. ILL. Mickey Mantle, one of the most famous baseball players who ever lived, during a press conference in Dallas while waiting for a new kidney, expressed regret over years of alcohol abuse. He said that he wished he had known the damage alcohol was doing to his body all those years, & warned young people everywhere, ""Don't be like me."" And it's not just in sports where this happens. It can happen in every walk of life. Our choices have consequences consequences that can affect not only our life but also the lives of those around us. In Deuteronomy 30:19, God told the Israelites that He was setting before them ""life & death, blessings & curses"" & He encouraged them to choose life. Joshua challenged his countrymen, ""Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve... but as for me & my house we will serve the Lord."" (Joshua 24:15) I. MAKE SURE YOUR CHOICES HONOR GOD Now let me summarize the whole point of this sermon: Every day, make sure your choices honor God. You'll never regret it! A. We are living in an age when many are consumed with the idea of success & winning. Some will do almost anything to succeed or to win. ILL. When Bill Veeck owned the Cleveland Indians baseball franchise, it is said that he would have the outfield fences moved either in or out, depending on the team that they would be playing next. He would position the fences in a way that he felt would give the Cleveland Indians an advantage over their opponents."
1 Corinthians 1:18-31,"('Paul & Corinthians', '1 & 2 Corinthians', 'Corinthians')",*other," The word theology comes from two Greek words: Theos (God) and logos (study, research). Thus, theology is the study of God. I am richly blessed to be a graduate of Evangelical Theological Seminary. My course of study (Master of Divinity) included five semesters in systematic theology, among the most difficult in the program, eclipsing even language studies by a considerable margin. To complete five semesters a student invests nearly 1,000 hours in class time, reading, research and writing. Theological studies--while wonderfully valuable--are very challenging. But you aren't finished with theology when you complete these; the next five semesters are designed to put your theology to work in practical ways through the study and practice of spiritual disciplines. One identifies a weakness, chooses a discipline to address it, develops a strategy for improvement, and carries out that plan daily through the semester. Each project is complete when you submit a paper on your results. Survivors of practical theology learn the difference between an academic understanding and a practical understanding of theology. The faculty's reasoning is sound. Theology, if not extended by a deep commitment to changing one's life, is simply academic--an intellectual enterprise. The goal is the self-examination and response to that which God reveals to students through study and prayer. [Sound advice for all Christians-not just seminarians. Knowledge is important, but insufficient. Man's wisdom is folly compared to God's. So, what good is knowledge if faith is all that we need?] I. INTRODUCTION 1. Two weeks ago, we studied Paul's opening remarks to the believers in the Churches in Corinth, concentrating on his use of the word call to describe their relationship to God made possible by Christ. Called into fellowship with Christ, and hence called to holy living considering that fellowship. 2. The urgency of Paul's message is not coincidental; there are serious divisions forming in the church at Corinth. Paul writes to correct and explain the necessary balance between wisdom and faith. 3. Some believers in Corinth mistake their recent understanding of the gospel as a form of special wisdom given only to a few beneficiaries--a group to which they naturally belong. This happens after Paul leaves for Ephesus and other teachers arrive on the scene: A. Apollos, an accomplished Alexandrian Jew who is ""mighty in the Scriptures"", having learned at the feet of Pricilla and Aquila in Ephesus (Acts 18:24,26), comes to preach the Gospel in Paul's footsteps (and perhaps with greater eloquence). No problem here: but B. Other teachers, less friendly to Paul and with leanings to Judaism, also begin to work. In a short time, the infant church splits into parties, with each claiming a teacher as its leader (apparently without the consent of that teacher). C. Their confidence in human wisdom stifles their spiritual growth and endangers the church. 4. Paul intervenes quickly and powerfully. He challenges the Corinthian believers to compare God's wisdom to man's wisdom by claiming that the gospel is in fact a contradiction to wisdom. OYBT 1 Cor. 1, as we consider Paul's treatise on wisdom and folly."
Galatians 3:13-14,"('Blessing', 'Power', ""Christ's Power"")",Assembly Of God," January 29, 2017 Morning Worship Text: Galatians 3:14 Subject: The Blessing of Abraham Title: Redeemed to Receive the Holy Spirit WE have spent the last eight weeks in a series that we called ""Redeemed"" and the focus of the series has been to raise your faith level to the point where you can fully understand who you are ""in Christ"" and to ""forgot not all His benefits""... Galatians 3:7-9 (NKJV) 7 Therefore know that only those who are of faith are sons of Abraham. 8 And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, saying, ""In you all the nations shall be blessed."" 9 So then those who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham. I believe with all my heart that the bible teaches us that it is God's desire that those who know Him be blessed. Now you can define blessing any way you want. Paul wrote to the church in Ephesus that God has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms... So if you want to you can limit the blessings to being blessed spiritually and you won't be any worse off for it. But I believe that we are intended to receive blessings from the Lord as the church of Jesus Christ. Physical health, power and authority, the fulfillment of our needs and even God's blessing on our finances, our businesses, our families, our work places, and potentially every decision we make for our future... Now, having said all that, I will say this: Though all these blessings are real for us there is more to it than just recognizing the promise and then claiming it as your own. You have a responsibility to live out a prescribed course of action for your life if you are ever to have the confidence and the faith to receive from the Lord. Galatians 3:13-14 (NKJV) 13 Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, ""Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree""), 14 that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. I believe this is God's word... I believe it is for me... I accept it as mine... I will appropriate it to my life today... Verse 14 is the key to everything that we have spoken of for the last two months. The key thing to see here... The blessings only come through your receiving the promise of the Spirit. Understanding this equates our relationship with the Father as the same as that of Abraham. Paul, in writing to the church in Rome about Abraham, Romans 4:18-22 (NKJV) 18 who, contrary to hope, in hope believed, so that he became the father of many nations, according to what was spoken, ""So shall your descendants be."" 19 And not being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body, already dead (since he was about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah's womb."
1 Corinthians 1:10-17,"('Paul', 'Apollos', 'Paul & Corinthians', 'Corinthians')",*other," An African proverb says, ""When elephants fight, grass gets trampled."" Elephants do not throw their weight around for nothing. The average African elephant weighs 16,534 lbs. The largest elephant on record weighed about 24,000 pounds and was 13 feet tall! Wild elephants eat all types of vegetation, from grass and fruit to leaves and bark--about 220 to 440 pounds each day. They also drink about 30 gallons of water each day. Building a church is hard enough without bigger-than-life characters causing a stampede. Often, there are conflicts, disagreements and misunderstandings. The church at Corinth had been nurtured by two of the world's greatest evangelists: Paul and Apollos. Their individual followers were displeased with each other, disrespected each other, and distant from each other. This strained the fellowship in the church, neglected the work of the gospel, hurt the name of the church in the community, and destroyed any hope of possible reconciliation. I. INTRODUCTION 1. The Church began as a singular, apostolic band of believers. In the last 2000 years, it has divided, and divided, and divided again. We've done some harm to the unified body Christ intended. 2. The history of Christendom is fraught with division. Believers trusting their own wisdom to the exclusion of another's, and this 'fight to be right' divides the church. It did not begin with us; the church in Corinth had a similar problem. OYBT 1 Corinthians 1. 3. It's tempting so see this passage as just a 'fight to be right', because we so easily identify with that in the contemporary church. But the problem in Corinth is not that simple, as we'll see in the next few minutes. [Jesus wants us to abandon our compromised, self-centered involvement in the church and turn to the God-centered communal life He can use for his resolve. The purpose of the church is to reflect God's character to the world. When elephants fight, grass gets trampled.] II. THE CHURCH: CALLED TO HOLINESS (10) 1. I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ... A. Paul considers them brothers and sisters based on their adoption into God's family. In Christ, they are God's children--joint heirs with Christ--therefore Paul's (holy) siblings. B. His appeal is in Christ's name, not his own. Paul wants the believers in Corinth to know that being a child of God means behaving in a pattern of holiness. 2. Agree with one another in what you say...perfectly united in mind and thought. A. Our first inclination is ""no way!"" We aren't perfect people, but sinners saved by grace! God knows my flaws and shortcomings--he understands me. He accepts me. It's OK. B. Consider this: God brought us into fellowship with him through the blood of his own Son. He wanted us, who are unholy, to be holy--as He is holy. Christ accomplishes that for us, calling us (the church) to a holy lifestyle before God on His merit. [The purpose of the church is to reflect God's character to the world.] III. THE CHURCH: CALLED TO UNITY (11-17) 1. (I have heard) there are quarrels among you."
Genesis 1:1-3,"('God Watches', 'God Sees', 'God Knows Us', 'God  Almighty')",Baptist," YOU MAY RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE. Genesis 3: 7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. 8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. 9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? 1. Why men try to hide. Fear caused by God's holiness. Exodus 3: 5 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. 6 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. Isaiah 6: 6 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: 7 And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged. 8 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me. Revelation 1: 17 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: Fear caused men's sinfulness. 2. Where men hide. Behind false hopes. Behind indifference Behind self-righteous acts. Behind innocence. Behind ignorance. 3.You may run but you can't hide impossible. Proverbs 28: 12 When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden. 13 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. Amos 9: 2 Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down: 3 And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them: 4 And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good. Jonah 1: 3 But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD. Psalms 139: 7 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? 8 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. 9 If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; 10 Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. 11 If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me. 12 Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee."
"Matthew 7:1, John 7:24","('Judgement', 'Hypocrisy', 'Reprove')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," In the pluralistic culture we currently live in the greatest 'sin' is intolerance and self-contradictory moral relativism runs rampant as judgments are suspended so that each person can define what is morally right or wrong for them. The Bible verse most often taken out of context to condemn those who quote the Bible to expose a false teacher, prophet, or corruption and sin in the ministry is ""Judge not, that you be not judged"" (Matt 7:1 ESV, See also 7:5; John 8:7-8). The irony exposed here is that the person using this verse, and others like it, have taken them out of context and hypocritically pronounced judgment on those they accuse of judging. The word ""judge"" is the Greek word ""diakrino."" It is often translated as ""judge, discern and weigh carefully."" However, the word actually means to separate, examine, investigate, question, select, choose, or determine like a Court Judge presiding over a case as they listen to all the facts presented before rendering a verdict (Lev 19:15). Jesus said to ""Judge with righteous judgment"" (John 7:24). The Apostle Paul said, ""I speak as to wise men; you judge what I say"" (1 Cor 10:15). Every Born-Again Christian is implored to ""test"" (Gk: ""dokimazo"" which means to examine, analyze, prove) ""everything"" and ""hold fast what is good"" (1 Thess 5:21-22 ESV). It is impossible to go through life without judging, and there is no escaping it in this life or when entering into the next (1 Cor 6:9-10). Without judgment forgiveness is impossible. The Bible clearly gives every Born-Again Christian the authority and right to humbly discern and make the distinction between truth and error, right and wrong, good and evil and the teaching or behavior of others, as long as they honor and obey God's Word by making sure their observations are following the rule of law in order to separate truth from error. It is by ""their fruits"" that a Born-Again Christian is recognized (Matt 7:16). The Golden Rule says that people should treat others the way they want to be treated (Matt 7:12). They should not make rash, hypocritical and overly harsh judgments about anything. If they do, God will treat them the way they have treated others (Mt. 5:14-15; 7:12). Only Jesus can truly know and judge a person's heart (Ps 44:21; 1 Sam 16:7) and determine if someone is a Born-Again Christian because He alone is the author of salvation (Prov 16:2; Rom 2:16). Jesus doesn't warn against the judging of another's actions or behavior but warns against self-deception, pride, and hypocrisy (Matt 7:1; 1 Cor 4:5). In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus warns of the human tendency to judge based on one's own faults and flaws and condemns hypocrisy rather than judgment, rebuking those who judge others for doing what they themselves do. Righteous judgment begins with personal reflection and prayer just as King David did. ""Search me, O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my thoughts! And see if there be any grievous way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting!"" (Ps 139:23-24 ESV)"
"John 3:1-21, 2 Corinthians 1:12","('Evangelism', 'Salvation', 'New Birth', 'Water Baptism')",Church Of God," Jesus & Nicodemus Series: Conversational Evangelism Lakewood COG | Pastor Jonathan | 1-29-2017 John 3:1-21 Introduction: Jesus was a conversationalist. There are a few times where we see Jesus standing and crying out but the majority of the teachings of Jesus we conversational in nature. (He sat down and taught them saying, He spoke to them by the way, He walked up to them and said come and follow me, He stopped on the road at a sycamore tree and asked Zacchaeus to come down for tea, etc.) In our text today we see Jesus having a conversation with Nicodemus. Let's explore it together! Shall we? I. The Strongest Attraction to the lost is the Power of God on Display (V.2) A. Nicodemus knew that Jesus was not just another individual. 1. He called Him Rabbi B. People in powerful positions are constantly watching the Church to see if they produce what they profess. 1. He was a ""Ruler of the Jews"" who came to Jesus by night. 2. Most of the time you will win people to Christ who are in powerful positions privately. 3. Never take advantage of their position for personal gain... Most of them are used to being used and are constantly looking for the shoe to drop. C. Nicodemus knew that there was something supernatural about Christ. (V. 2) 1. ""...no man can do these miracles that you are doing unless God is with Him."" II. Conversational Evangelism - Jesus realized that his heart was opening and He began to talk with him about the condition of his heart. (V. 3-7) A. Seeing the Kingdom of God can be interpreted in many ways. 1. If Jesus is not in your heart you will not go to heaven. 2. Seeing the Kingdom of God is to see God's systems and ways of doing things. (Matt. 6:33) 3. It can also be further interpreted as understanding things pertaining to the Kingdom of God. B. Nicodemus was trapped in ""practicality"". (How can we enter back into the womb and be born?) (V. 4) 1. We can't expect lost people to think like we do... C. V.3 Is ""See"" the Kingdom - V.5 is ""Enter"" the Kingdom 1. Jesus explains that there must be a natural birth and a spiritual birth. - Born of the water is the Natural Birth - Born of the Spirit is the New Birth D. Jesus uses nature to further explain the meaning of the New Birth (The Wind) 1. The message of the New Birth was never intended to be complicated. 2 Corinthians 1:12 For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward. 2 Corinthians 11:3 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty (trickery), so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. 2. In communicating with lost people we should be discerning of our environment. God my use it to further explain the message of the Gospel in a simple, tangible and uncomplicated way. - Jesus and Nicodemus may have been outside where the wind was blowing... III. Nicodemus's next question had to do with ""How could this be"". It's almost like He was saying, ""Even if I did accept what you are saying at face value Jesus, How is this possible?"" (V. 9-15)"
2 Samuel 6:5-11,"('Worship', ""God's Holiness"")",Baptist," ""David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the LORD, with songs and lyres and harps and tambourines and castanets and cymbals. And when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah put out his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah, and God struck him down there because of his error, and he died there beside the ark of God. And David was angry because the LORD had broken out against Uzzah. And that place is called Perez-uzzah to this day. And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and he said, 'How can the ark of the LORD come to me?' So, David was not willing to take the ark of the LORD into the city of David. But David took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. And the ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months, and the LORD blessed Obed-edom and all his household."" [1] The people were worshipping with genuine enthusiasm--celebrating before the LORD! There was laughter, music, singing, dancing. The congregation was filled with joy--rapturous, untrammeled joy. The dulcimer sounds of lyres and harps harmonised with the mournful sound of trumpets as tambourines and cymbals kept time [cf. 1 CHRONICLES 13:8]. The king was leading the festivities, dancing with all his might, when the oxen stumbled. Over thirty thousand hand-selected men were accompanying the Ark of the Covenant, led by the King himself. It was only a momentary slip of the beasts' feet, but it was enough to rock the Ark which was on the cart they were pulling. The priest driving the cart reached back to steady the Ark so it wouldn't fall; but the moment he touched the Ark, he fell dead. Everything changed in that one moment. Those blowing on the trumpets lowered them in shock at what they witnessed. The ones strumming on the lyres and the harps stopped moving their hands across the strings. The cymbals and tambourines hung loosely from hands as the dancers stopped their lively steps. Everyone stared silently; God had struck Uzzah dead. WORSHIP THE LORD IN THE BEAUTY OF HOLINESS -- ""David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the LORD, with songs and lyres and harps and tambourines and castanets and cymbals."" For seventy years, the Ark of the Covenant had been held by the Philistines. These warlike peoples defeated Israel in battle, capturing the Ark of the Covenant [see 1 SAMUEL 4:1-11]. The Ark was kept as a trophy of war, but the Philistines were most uncomfortable with this symbol of the LORD God in their midst. Strange things happened wherever the Ark was situated. The Ark was set in the Temple of Dagon, but each morning the idol of Dagon was toppled and found the following morning on the face. At last, the idol suffered the indignity of having the head and hands cut off and placed on the threshold of the Temple. It was unnerving how this kept happening. On top of that, the people suffered with unexplained tumours in the city of Ashdod. So, the Ark was sent to Gath so those people could enjoy the spoils of war [see 1 SAMUEL 5:1-8]."
Ephesians 2:1-10,"('Grace', 'Grace Alone', 'The Five Solas')",Wesleyan," I was sixteen when Gary Gilmore died it was January 17 1977. And maybe some of you are thinking: That name sounds familiar. Gilmore was a petty criminal from Texas who would have lived and died in complete obscurity except for one thing. He became the first person in the United States to be executed after the supreme court reversed a 1972 decision that had ruled capital punishment to be a cruel and unusual punishment. In July of 1976 Gary Gilmore committed two armed robberies in the state of Utah and in both cases shot and killed the people he was robbing. He was sentenced to death and because he refused to appeal his sentence he was executed six months later. So we only know about Gary Gilmore because of the medias fascination with him being the first American executed in five years. And even though it was forty years ago I still remember all the media hype that the case generated. As a side note the United States has executed 1444 people since then and if you kill a white person you are 3 times more likely to be executed than if you killed a person of colour. Just saying. The other thing that captured the attention of the media and society was that Gary Gilmore was executed by firing squad. Which seemed to me as kind of strange at the time. Utah and Oklahoma are the only two states that allow execution by firing squad and in this case Gilmore actually requested that he be allowed to die that way. And there was a reason, you see Gary Gilmore's mother was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ and Latter Day Saints, that is she was a Mormon, and that had a profound effect on how Gary would choose to die. Gilmore's brother Mikal would write that his brother's decision was because he wanted ""To spill his blood on Mormon soil, as an apology to God."" Which might seem a little strange to us but was based on the LDS theology of Blood Atonement that had been taught by Brigham Young. And while blood atonement is no longer required by the church in 1978 LDS apostle Bruce R. McConkie, claiming to reflect the view of church leadership, wrote that he still believed that certain sins are beyond the atoning power of the blood of Christ. And while we might not hold to the theology of Blood Atonement there are those who still believe that some sins are beyond the Grace of God. This is week four of our ""Old Foundation"" series. 2017 is the 500th anniversary of the Protestant Reformation. In 1517 a catholic priest by the name of Martin Luther took the church to task for what he felt were theological errors that needed to be corrected. He wrote a list of these errors and nailed them to the door of the largest church in the area, the Wittenberg Cathedral. Now a couple of things that we need to understand. Martin Luther did not start down this road in order to start a new denomination. His intention, as a priest and theologian was to start a healthy debate within the church which would ultimately bring the church back to its roots. It was ""The Church"", after all."
Mark 9:2-13,"('Glory', 'Moses', 'Transfiguration', 'Splendor And Majesty')",Baptist," A Mountain Top Experience Mark 9:1-13 Rev. Brian Bill January 28-29, 2017 What one incident or event comes to your mind when you think of the life of Jesus? Turn to the person next to you and share what it is... There was one miracle foremost in the Apostle Peter's memory, so much so that he wrote about it more than 30 years after it happened. According to 2 Peter 1:16-18, a glimpse of God's glory had so gripped him that he couldn't stop talking about it: ""For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. For when he received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, 'This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased,' we ourselves heard this very voice borne from heaven, for we were with him on the holy mountain."" This eyewitness encounter showcased the power, majesty, honor and glory of Jesus Christ. And notice that this was not just Peter's perspective because he uses the emphatic phrase, ""we ourselves,"" referring to his buddies James and John who were also there. I love how Mark lays out the flow of events in his gospel. The big idea last weekend was this: Salvation is free, but discipleship will cost you your life from Mark 8:34: ""'If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."" We're called to line up our desires, to deny ourselves, to die to sin, and to devote ourselves to follow Him. We learned that we're as close to Christ as we want to be. This is certainly one of the most challenging statements Jesus ever made. After driving this truth deeply into our souls, our passage today showcases who Jesus is and that there's a better world waiting for Christ-followers. Here's the sermon summary: A glimpse of glory will keep us going. As I prayed about how to preach through this passage, I decided to approach the sermon differently. Instead of concluding with a number of action steps, my aim is simply to have our view of God grow grander. Specifically, I'm praying that we will catch a glimpse of the glory of Jesus Christ and that this will motivate us to gather, grow, give and go like never before. I like this quote from A.W. Tozer's book The Knowledge of the Holy: ""What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us...the cause of many of our modern spiritual woes is the loss in today's church of a lofty concept of God."" He argues persuasively that the cure lies in our rediscovery of God's majesty. By the end of our time today, I'm hoping that our minds will be blown [demonstrate] by the bigness, the majesty, the greatness, the goodness and the glory of Jesus Christ. A generation ago J.B. Phillips wrote a book called, Your God Is Too Small. This captures the struggle many of us have because our God is much smaller than the God of the Bible. I long for each of us to grow in our grasp of how great God really is because it's so easy to fall into an inadequate view of the Almighty."
Revelation 11:14-19,"('Temple Of God', 'Book Of Revelation', 'Seventh Angel', 'Third Woe', 'Voices In Heaven')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 7-22-16 Series: Verse By Verse Through Revelations Title: Seventh Trumpet (Third Woe): The Victory of Christ and His Kingdom Proclaimed (11:14-19) Revelation 11:14-19 (KJV) 14 The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly. 15 And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever. 16 And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God, 17 Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. 18 And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth. 19 And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail. Introduction The last trump is about to sound, and that will lead to the outpouring of the vials of God's wrath. But first we are given a glimpse of the crowning in Heaven of God's rightful king. It seems as though they never get tired of crowning Him in Heaven! The title deeds of earth were given to Him in chapter five, and the elders cast their crowns at His feet. Here He is acknowledged as earth's rightful King. Later, in chapter 19, he comes forth as King of kings and Lord of lords, and on his head are many crowns. ? The scene is in Heaven, but news of what is happening is released on earth, with the result that the nations are enraged. They want no king but Caesar. One is tempted to linger long over this passage because the next two chapters are indeed deficient of blessings because they are occupied with the purposes of the evil one. Two truths are set before us here. The third woe on earth is described, and the thankful worship in Heaven is described. The two events stand in stark contrast to each other. Judgment on earth, jubilation in Heaven; rage on earth, rejoicing in Heaven; cursing on earth, crowning in Heaven; woe on earth, worship in Heaven. God balances the one against the other with expert skill. OUR STUDY OF THE BOOK OF REVELATION REQUIRES THAT WE BEAR IN MIND THAT JOHN IS DESCRIBING THE VISION THAT GOD GAVE HIM OF FUTURE EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE END OF THE WORLD. Commentary Verse 14 marks the end of the parenthetical portion of the vision; that includes everything that takes place between the sixth and the seven trumpets (10:1-11:14). The flying eagle had warned of three ""terrors"" or ""woes"" to come upon the earth: ""As I watched, I heard an eagle that was flying in midair call out in a loud voice: ""Woe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the other three angels!"" (8:13). The first woe was recorded in 9:1-12; the ""second woe"" in 9:13-21 and 11:1-13. The ""third woe"" is coming very soon. Most likely, 11:18 hints at the third woe which will include the battle of Armageddon--the final battle between God and Satan. This will begin when the angel sounds the seventh trumpet."
1 Corinthians 1:26-31,"('Boasting In Christ', 'Boast', 'Christ The Wisdom')",Lutheran," I want to begin by testing your celebrity savvy this morning. Who said the following? ""Let me tell you, I'm a really smart guy."" ""I'm also honored to have the greatest temperament that anybody has."" ""I think I am, actually humble. I think I'm much more humble than you would understand."" ""I've had a beautiful, I've had a flawless campaign. You'll be writing books about this campaign."" Yes, Donald Trump, now the 45th president of the United States, made those statements. I'm not drawing your attention to these quotes so that we can laugh at President Trump. He is after all an elected official, and even though he's not our leader we would do well to pray for him and his presidency because what happens in the U.S. affects us here in Canada. And anyway, it is God's will that we pray for those in authority, as well as honor and respect them. But it is hard to respect someone who is so blatantly boastful. The thing is, Trump has only verbalized thoughts we all entertain. When you answer correctly a tough question in class or propose a solution your coworkers really like, you may not say it but you do think it: ""Let me tell you, I'm a really smart guy."" And because you don't say that out loud you also think to yourself: ""And I'm really humble, more humble than you may realize."" Such boasting is of course not God-pleasing. But the Apostle Paul teaches us today that God isn't against all boasting. In fact Paul wanted the Christians in Corinth and we Christians here to know that we are a church fully equipped to boast...in Christ. Let's find out how to become better boasters. Our text once again comes from Paul's letter to the Christian church in the Greek city of Corinth. Corinth itself had a reputation for brashness. People who lived there felt sorry for those who didn't--the way people on Vancouver Island feel sorry for central Albertans. Unfortunately this arrogance had also spilled into the church. Some in the Corinthian congregation were well to do. They were proud of this fact and made a show of their wealth even at church. Other members liked to brag about how much of the Bible they knew and understood while looking down on others who were just learning the basics. To put matters into perspective for these braggarts, however, the Apostle Paul said: ""Brothers, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. 27 But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. 28 He chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things--and the things that are not--to nullify the things that are, 29 so that no one may boast before him"" (1 Corinthians 1:26-29). The fact was not many of the members in Corinth had much to boast about. Most were not rich. Most were not the movers and shakers in society or the trendsetters. Instead they were slaves or blue collar workers. Doesn't that sound a bit like our congregation? I haven't seen any of you interviewed in the newspaper because some journalist thought that our city would be interested in your views. Sure, you live in decent homes, but nothing a magazine would want a picture of. And although our new church building is a big upgrade from what we had, it's not a cathedral. If this congregation was really influential and rich, wouldn't we have been able to afford to build an even nicer and bigger sanctuary?"

Every shipmaster, all who travel by ship, sailors, and as many as trade on the sea, stood at a distance 18and cried out when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, 'What is like this great city?' 19They threw dust on their heads and cried out, weeping and wailing, and saying, 'Alas, alas, that great city, in which all who had ships on the sea became rich by her wealth! For in one hour she is made desolate.' 20Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets, for God has avenged you on her!"" 21Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, ""Thus with violence the great city Babylon shall be thrown down, and shall not be found anymore. 22The sound of harpists, musicians, flutists, and trumpeters shall not be heard in you anymore. No craftsman of any craft shall be found in you anymore, and the sound of a millstone shall not be heard in you anymore. 23The light of a lamp shall not shine in you anymore, and the voice of bridegroom and bride shall not be heard in you anymore. For your merchants were the great men of the earth, for by your sorcery all the nations were deceived. 24And in her was found the blood of prophets and saints, and of all who were slain on the earth."" We pick up today where we left off last Sunday in chapter 18. Last week we read about the destruction of Babylon.

Matthew 24:42-43,"('Death', 'Communion', 'Return', 'Illustration')",Christian/Church Of Christ," They planned it for many months if not for years. They had the right stuff - They brought a hammer and crowbar to break the locks - They wore gloves and hooded sweat shirts to protect their identities They waited for the right time - They waited for the stroke of midnight until the ball dropped - They waited for over 7,000 New York City Police to be distracted THEY were a trio of burglars, who made off with $6 million in gems from Gregg Ruth, a commercial jewelry store in downtown New York City. - The store was known for its rare yellow and pink diamonds. - Their pendants and necklaces are worth up to $150,000 apiece. And on New Year's Eve - When everyone was singing, partying, and waiting for the ball to drop AND - When the New York City police were keeping a watchful eye on the 2 million people plus watching the ball drop in Times Square Three thieves stole 6 million dollars' worth of precious jewels and diamonds. Jesus said in Matthew 24:42 ""Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. 43 But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. 44 So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him. One day Jesus will come back - We don't know when that will happen - We only know it will happen at a time when we least expect it Until Jesus comes back we have been given a way to remember He will come back 1 Corinthians 11:26 For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. The Lord's Supper Declares to the World Jesus Died For Our Sins That He Is Coming Back To Take His Church Out This World."
Matthew 5:1-12,"('Blessing', 'Beatitudes', 'Sermon On The Mount')",Baptist," Matthew 5:1-12 Bless You! What if you could be content no matter how tough life got? What if you could know for certain that things would turn out ok? Jesus says you can, without a doubt. Today I have a sermon on a sermon, in fact the most famous sermon ever preached! Matthew 5-7 contains Jesus' famous ""Sermon on the Mount."" People crowded on the hillside to hear it. Jesus sat down before them, the typical pose of a rabbi about to teach. And Jesus shared what we now call, ""The Beatitudes."" The word ""beatitude"" means ""blessed"" in Latin. To be blessed is much more than being happy. It's to be in a condition where you know you're okay because God says you are, regardless of your feelings. You have a profound sense of God's joy and peace. You might feel down, or flat, or up--it doesn't matter--and still be blessed at the same time. Blessedness is much more than an emotion; it is a certainty that God will take care of you, that ultimately things will turn out well. Jesus shares some blessings available now and some reserved for the life to come. For instance, his first and last beatitudes serve as bookends with an immediate blessing: ""Theirs 'is' the kingdom of heaven."" It's already unfolding! And then all the other beatitudes in the middle carry a future promise, that one ""will' be comforted, for instance. Some promises we have to wait for, until God brings in his new heaven and new earth. But others are ours right now, as we follow God. Blessed are the spiritually humble, the sorrowful, the patient, those spiritually hungry for righteousness, the merciful, the pure in heart, the peacemakers, and those who are persecuted for doing right. Let's unpack each of these. First, Jesus says, blessed are the ... 1. POOR IN SPIRIT. These are people who are desperate for God. They recognize their great need for his Spirit and can't get enough. This is the lady so broken over her sin that she washes Jesus' feet with her tears (Luke 7:37-38). It's the tax collector who beats his chest, praying, ""God, have mercy on me, a sinner"" (Luke 18:13). Jesus promises those who are poor in spirit already have the kingdom of heaven. If you know you are desperate for God, that you are spiritually bankrupt without him, you're there. You have arrived. As Jesus would say, ""The kingdom of God is at hand."" You are living in the kingdom as you are desperate for God to come through. Be blessed, as you recognize your utter dependence on the only one who can save you, who can give you strength and endurance and purpose and unconditional love. If you yearn for God above all else, you've got the kingdom of heaven. It's yours! Next, Jesus tells us, blessed are ... 2. THOSE WHO MOURN, those who grieve the loss of someone or something. Jesus promises comfort. I know some of you live this out as you walk without your mate at your side anymore. You didn't know how you would survive, but you did, one day at a time, with God's help. I could reflect on so many here, but I remember Bill Harris looking helplessly at his dear wife of 50 plus years in the ICU and turning to me and saying, ""Pastor, this is tougher than being a fighter pilot in Vietnam!"" Yes it is, but God will bring comfort."
Genesis 18:32-19:10,"('Faith', 'Sodom And Gomorrah')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Protected In The Midst Of It All Scriptures: Gen. 12;4-5; 13:5-11;18:32-19:10; 2 Pet. 2:4-9; Phil. 4:6-8 Introduction In my message last week I asked you if you were a starter or a finisher. I acknowledged the fact that you can't finish something unless you first start it and that there are many people who plan to start something and never get around to it. As it relates to our relationship with Christ, I made the assumption that all of us have started in that race but we have to finish it. If you recall from last week I reminded you of the story of Lot's wife and how after she had made it to safety from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, she turned around and looked at the destruction and turned into a pillar of salt. In this instance she had started but was not able to finish. The cost of her disobedience was her life. In addition to this story I shared with you what Jesus told His disciples in Matthew chapter twenty-four. Jesus said in the last days, the days in which we are living in now, many will fall away. Please understand that you cannot ""fall away"" from something that you never had. Jesus made it clear that there will be some who will be walking with Him and stop - just as some of His disciples did when He walked the earth (John 6:66). If you recall, these disciples followed Him until they became offended in some of His teaching and they left Him. In the last days we will have people who will walk away from their faith. They started in this race but will not finish it. If you are concerned about whether or not this could happen to you, take heart because God has given us a promise of protection in the midst of the world around us. This week we will examine Lot from the viewpoint of remaining a righteous man in the midst of wickedness. Remember, when God commanded Abraham to leave his home and his family, Abraham took Lot with him. Both Abraham and Lot had possession and after leaving Egypt, their possessions grew which led to them having to separate because the land they were dwelling in could not sustain both of their cattle. This led to Lot choosing to dwell in the city of Sodom. Turn with me back to Genesis chapter eighteen. We will begin reading at verse thirty-two. ""Then he said, 'Oh may the Lord not be angry, and I shall speak only this once; suppose ten are found there?' And He said, 'I will not destroy it on account of the ten.' As soon as He had finished speaking to Abraham the LORD departed, and Abraham returned to his place. Now the two angels came to Sodom in the evening as Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. And he said, 'Now behold, my lords, please turn aside into your servant's house, and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may rise early and go on your way.' They said however, 'No, but we shall spend the night in the square.' Yet he urged them strongly, so they turned aside to him and entered his house; and he prepared a feast for them, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. Before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter; and they called to Lot and said to him, 'Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may have relations with them.' But Lot went out to them at the doorway, and shut the door behind him, and said, 'Please, my brothers, do not act wickedly.' Now behold, I have two daughters who have not had relations with man; please let me bring them out to you, and do to them whatever you like; only do nothing to these men, inasmuch as they have come under the shelter of my roof."" But they said, 'Stand aside.' Furthermore, they said, 'This one came in as an alien, and already he is acting like a judge; now we will treat you worse than them.' So they pressed hard against Lot and came near to break the door. But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them, and shut the door."

John 11:1-45,"('Resurrection', 'Lazarus Raised', ""Jesus' Resurrection"", 'Jesus Is The  Life')",Anglican," How are you at reading the signs? I don't mean street signs or advertising signs, I mean the signs of God's kingdom? Over the last few months we've been looking at how John draws out sign after sign from Jesus' life; signs of who Jesus is and signs of what he came to do; signs in fact of God's kingdom being revealed on earth. And the point of all these signs is to bring us to belief in Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God; to show us the way to life. In fact that idea of Jesus bringing life comes out very clearly doesn't it? We've seen how Jesus is the bread of life; how he offers the water of life; how he is the light of life; and today we discover that he's the resurrection and the life. But the question is, what does that mean for us? In what sense is he the resurrection and the life for you and me? Well, let's see what we find as we look at this passage. The narrative begins with Jesus hiding from the Jewish leaders across the Jordan where John had been baptising at the start of the gospel: interestingly, it's also called Bethany in ch1, but not the Bethany where Martha and Mary lived. While he's there Lazarus, Martha and Mary's brother, becomes ill. So they send a message to Jesus to come and heal him. Lazarus, we discover, is one of those who's particularly loved by Jesus. They would have expected Jesus to respond quickly to this plea but instead he tells his disciples there's no need to worry because this illness doesn't lead to death. Rather it's for God's glory. Do you remember 2 weeks ago we read how Jesus said a similar thing about the blind man's illness? He wasn't blind because of some sin but so that God's glory might be revealed. Well the same applies here. But notice what else he says: ""rather it is for God's glory, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it."" What they're about to witness is a sign that both glorifies God but at the same time glorifies the Son of God. In fact if you think about it, Jesus is the one in whom God pre-eminently reveals himself. So any glory that Jesus receives is, at the same time, glory that God receives. Or to think of it the other way round, God delights to see his Son glorified and the Son delights to glorify the Father. What we're about to see is the beginning of the glory of Jesus being revealed. It's not the full glory though, just a glimpse. His full glory will be revealed in his death and resurrection as we discover in the next chapter, but right now he's about to perform his greatest sign so far, a sign that shows him to be the one the whole world is waiting for. Now clearly Jesus knows what's going on. He has some sort of supernatural knowledge of the events in Bethany. But he doesn't hurry off to heal Lazarus. Instead he waits two full days. What's he doing? Some people have suggested there's a hardheartedness in Jesus actions here. Rather than hurrying off to care for his friends he leaves them to mourn for 4 days before getting there. But John makes it quite clear that that's not the case. He loves Martha and Mary and Lazarus. But they need more than just his comfort and care. They need to read the signs in a way that leads them to true faith in him and as a result to eternal life."
Mark 11:12-24,"('Palm Sunday', 'The Fig Tree')",Assembly Of God," Mark 11:12-11:24 We're going to look from the scriptures at two of Jesus Christ's most misunderstood actions. The two actions I'm talking about are: (a) Jesus Christ's cursing of a fig tree and (b) his action of driving out the money changes from the Jewish temple. On their own, these two events are very difficult to understand, but together these two events explain each other. Now the way Mark tells us these two stories, he wants us to know that the two events help explain each other. You see, throughout his biography of Jesus , Mark uses a sandwich technique, where he starts with one story, goes to a different story, and then comes back to the original story. Mark's starts by telling the story of Jesus cursing the fig tree, then interrupt that story to describe Jesus driving out the money changers from the temple and only then will he return to the story of the fig tree. This is Mark's way of telling us that these two events are related to each other, and that if we miss the meaning of the fig tree, we'll miss the meaning of the clearing out of the temple as well. 1. The Fruitless Fig Tree (Mark 11:12-14, 20-21) We begin with Jesus cursing a fig tree starting with one side of the sandwich in vv. 12-14 and then the other side of the sandwich in vv. 20-21. Many people have struggled with why Jesus curses this fig tree. This is Jesus' last recorded miracle in Mark's biography, and it seems odd that it's a miracle of destruction. Since Mark tells us that wasn't the season for figs, Jesus' expectation to find figs seems unreasonable to us at first. In fact, the famous atheist writer Bertrand Russell listed this miracle as one of the reasons why he's not a Christian. Jesus has left Bethany and is on his way to Jerusalem. So most likely the tree would be found in the vicinity of the Mount of Olives which would be on his way to Jerusalem. On the protected side of the mount of olives fig trees can be seen in leaf many times at the end of March or early April. Early green figs will appear before the leaves, they do not taste very good, nor do people eat them. They do not ripen until June, and very oft en will fall off, leaving only leaves. Jesus knows there will be no fruit. Yes, Jesus is hungry, but his action, like the action of entering Jerusalem and the action of cleaning the Temple point to a greater, deeper meaning, what will happen to Jerusalem, Israel and the Temple. The prophets frequently spoke of the fig tree as referring to Israel's status before God: Jer. 8:13, 29:17; Hos 9:10, 16; Joel 1:7, Micah 7:1-6. Jer. 8:13 "" 'I will take away their harvest, declares the LORD. There will be no grapes on the vine. There will be no figs on the tree, and their leaves will wither. What I have given them will be taken from them.'"" The destruction of the fig tree is associated with judgment Hos. 2:12 ""I will ruin her vines and her fig trees, which she said were her pay from her lovers; I will make them a thicket, and wild animals will devour them."" Isaiah 34:4, Luke 13:6-9. Here in this context the fig tree symbolizes Israel in Jesus' day and what happens to the tree is the fate (it withers) that will happen to Jerusalem."
Matthew 1:18-21,"('Fatherhood', 'Stepfathers')",Episcopal," Listen to the Scripture on Joseph's side of the Nativity story: Now the birth of Jesus the Messiah took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, but before they lived together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. Her husband Joseph, being a righteous man and unwilling to expose her to public disgrace, planned to dismiss her quietly. But just when he had resolved to do this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, ""Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."" (Matthew 1:18-21) Here we are, on the Fourth Sunday of Advent. Christmas Eve is just two days away and we are all waiting for the celebration of the birth of the Christ Child. But waiting for what? Some are waiting for travel and returning to families, for parties and merrymaking; "" children wait wide-eyed for Santa and gifts, "" while others delight in special music, plays and art displays. "" Some are waiting for meals to be cooked and eaten, houses in disarray to be made right, order to return after chaos, and to be able to stop pretending all is perfect when it almost never is. The most common answer to what we are waiting for is the celebration of the birth of Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ Child, who we believe came as a prophet, teacher, example and God Incarnate - to show the world a better way to live. But . . . what does that mean - for us today. . . in this complex world of 2016? Today's scriptures tell the Nativity story from another point of view: from the standpoint of Joseph, the father. We all remember the story of the Angel Gabriel visiting Mary and telling her she would bear the Son of God. Today's scriptures however, points us to an aspect of our beloved Christmas story often glossed over - the fact that Joseph was NOT the father of Jesus. He is described as a 'righteous man', a member of the synagogue and follower of Jewish law. But he went against all Jewish religious and cultural laws to stay with his young betrothed, to shield her from certain infamy and dishonor, as well as himself. To be, in fact, the stepfather of Jesus - - all of this because God spoke to him in a dream! How many of you are stepfathers? Imagine yourself in Joseph's place; here he is betrothed to a lovely young maiden, probably making him the envy of Nazareth. And, all of a sudden, she is pregnant! Now, he knows he is NOT the father. In those times, when a couple was betrothed, the girl moved into the house of her espoused to learn from her future mother-in-law, making this situation even more disturbing. So, it wasn't as if she was living somewhere else and could have been carrying on with someone behind his back. Joseph intended to quietly dissolve the arrangement and send Mary back to her home. Jewish law said that a man and woman were not supposed to have intimate relations until they were married. A righteous man like Joseph, would have honored that law. But he suddenly learns that his fiancé is ''with child"" - and he doesn't know it has come through the Holy Spirit. All he knows is that he has a horrible dilemma. If he marries Mary, others would assume that he disobeyed the Jewish laws."
Romans 12:2,"('Change', 'Renewing The Mind')",Baptist," We come to the ""V"" in ""recovery"", which stands for ""voluntarily."" Voluntarily submit to every change God wants to make in my life and humbly ask Him to remove my character defects. 1. Where do our character defects come from? A. My Chromosomes - They are inherited. Your parents contributed 23,000 chromosomes each. You inherited some of their weaknesses. This explains a predisposition towards certain problems, but it doesn't excuse sin. Because of my folks, I may have a tendency to lose my temper but it doesn't excuse my committing murder. I may have a tendency to be lazy but it doesn't excuse me to live as a bum. I may tend to be given to certain addictions, but it doesn't excuse me making the choice to become addicted. B. My Circumstances - They are nurtured. You're raised a certain way and learned things from parents and others. A lot of defects are self-defeating attempts to address legitimate needs. We all have a need for respect. But you didn't get respect early in life, so you figured out ways to get attention. We all have a need for love. But if you didn't get love you may settle for cheap sex, to get emotional closeness. We all have a need for security but if you didn't get it, you may have tried to find it in materialism and ""things."" C. My Choices - They are habitual. If you choose something long enough, it becomes habit. Habits you never intended to develop, become habits because if you choose to do a certain thing often enough, it becomes a habit! 2. Why is it so hard to change character defects in my life? A. Because I've had them so long. Many of these habits may be self-defeating but at least they're familiar. Like an old pair of shoes. They may not be the best for running, but they're comfortable. It's hard to let go of them. B. Because that's how I identify myself. We can confuse our identity with our defect. ""I'm a workaholic, or overweight, or anxious, or fearful."" You can't change because you're afraid - ""If I let it go, will I still be me?"" C. Because of the payoff. My defect can mask pain; give an excuse to fail; compensate for guilt; get me attention; or let me control others. When negative behavior is repeated, even if self-destructive, it's because there's a payoff. We do what get rewarded. So we don't want to let go of it. D. Satan discourages me. Satan's says, ""This'll never work, you can't change. Who do you think you are? Other people can change, but not you.."" The Bible says Satan's a liar; but the truth sets us free. So, let's look at the truth. 3. How do I cooperate with God's change process in my life? READ TEXT Romans 12:2 says, ""Be transformed by the renewing of your mind."" If you want to change your life you've got to change the way you think. If you're in a boat and the autopilot says East, you can force it to go West, but pretty soon you get tired, and let go of the boat, because it wants to go back East. Because it's set to go East. I think a certain way and am preset to certain courses of action. I can try by my will power to redirect my life, but I soon become weary and fail. But when you enter into a relationship with God through faith in Christ, He dwells within you by His Spirit. And by the power of the person present within you, your life can be changed from the inside out, as you change the way you think! But you've got to receive, before you can achieve! You must trust in Him before He can transform you."
Philippians 4:8-13,"('Peace', 'Happiness', 'Contentment')",Baptist," ""The Secret to Contentment"" Philippians 4: 8-13 An old Chinese Proverb says this.... If you want happiness for an hour, take a nap; if you want happiness for a day--go fishing, if you want happiness for a year, go inherit a fortune; but if you want happiness for a lifetime-go help someone. Whatever we call it---joy, gladness, being blessed, happiness or contentment, it is something all of us want. In many ways it is a journey and for many people they are on that journey for their entire life and never seem to find it. We look at other people and we think ...they sure look happy...why do they seem to get all the breaks in life? What are they doing that I am not doing? And sometimes if we really get to a low place we start thinking everybody's happy, everyone else is content except poor old me. ? There was a man in the scripture named Saul and Saul was on a journey much like we are. We look for fulfillment; for happiness but we don't always look in the right places. Saul was a man who seemed to have it all, a Pharisee who was very intelligent, knew the law inside out, studied the Hebrew scripture under one of the finest teachers in his day, born to Jewish parents who had Roman citizenship. Saul had great power. He was feared and respected by many people. For Saul, he seemed to find his identity through prestige and power and wealth. But like many people he realized he was following a path that would only lead to destruction. Let me start with a question to help us think this morning. Why is it that we pray for happiness but then we look for it in the wrong place? Think about these 3 places we look. (1) One of the more obvious places we turn to is money/things. For some reason we have been made to believe by every ad we see on TV or on billboards that money will buy happiness. Because if we have money we can buy products that will make us happier. Coca-Cola's new theme is ""when you open a coke you are opening a bottle of happiness. I like Coke. I collect Coke products but believe me when you open a bottle of Coke you are opening bottle of sugar water. Those who work in marketing secretly work to create an image that if you use their product you will somehow be happier. Coca-Cola says open the bottle. You will open happiness. Volkswagen says Get in-Get happy. Drive a certain car. Use a certain product. Use a certain deodorant and your life will certainly improve. The Bible puts all of this into perspective and we are told that if we put Christ first then all of these other things will fall into place. The answer will not be found in owning things. Last year America spent $70 billion on lottery tickets. More than we spent on sports tickets, books, video games, movies and music-combined. People love the lottery. And the reason is simple. We believe it's a chance to find real happiness. But it's just the opposite actually. According to Time magazine here's how winning the lottery can actually make you miserable. These are actual testimonies. "" One man went broke four years later after winning $315 million. He lost a daughter and a granddaughter to drug overdoses. He was robbed of over a half million dollars while sitting in his car. He said I don't like what I've become. I wish I had torn the ticket up instead."
Matthew 6:1-18,"('Forgiveness', 'Freedom', 'Bondage')",Baptist," ""Get out of jail, Free"" Matthew 6:1-18 Medical science has been telling us now for years that there is a very close relationship between physical illness and stress. That shouldn't be hard for us to believe since when you go through a time of extended stress and difficulty, many times we become physically sick. I read this week in fact that it is possible that up to 80% of those who are currently hospitalized have a stress related illnesses. 80%. Hospital chaplains have noticed also that many times there is a strong connection between the physical and spiritual. Jesus obviously knew this and we see this teaching being applied in the gospel of Matthew... Chapter 9. A man who was paralyzed is brought to Jesus on a mat. Jesus heals the man and the Bible says that he jumped up and went home. Amazing. But if you read the passage too quickly you will miss the words Jesus spoke to bring healing to the man. Here they are. Jesus said, be encouraged my child, your sins are forgiven. Interesting words to speak to heal someone. Yet the words, your sins are forgiven are possibly the most powerful words we can speak to someone who has hurt us... Offended us, damaged us in any way. Jesus teaches on this topic of forgiveness on numerous occasions and the results are always powerful. In Matthew chapter 6, he addresses the topic again and it is here that He tells us how to pray and He concludes with a powerful statement about forgiveness. We need to look at all of these verses to fully understand what Jesus was saying. There are actually at least four topics he addresses here... Giving, praying, forgiving and fasting and He addresses them in that order. I want to look at each one briefly but want to focus on the topic of forgiveness. Because these topics have a definite connection. (1) When you give, give with the right attitude. It would be easy for me as your pastor to simply say, ""I don't really care how you give, just as long as you give"" but that's not what the Bible teaches. When you give you must give with the right attitude. Here is the principle. When you give, give privately, not publicly. Jesus is letting us know right off the bat that if we give for the purpose of being seen by others, to impress someone, to make some kind of righteous appearance-you will have no reward in heaven. This word reward runs through this passage like a red thread shows up on white material... In other words it is very obvious. Seven times we will see it today. It is a definite theme and it is the theme that seems to connect these passages. I don't think most of us give expecting a reward but Jesus makes it clear that if we give with the right attitude there will be one. Notice two things he tells us specifically not to do when we give. "" Don't give for public applause. "" Don't tell others about your giving. Give in private. In Jesus day, right at the entrance to the temple there were large metal containers, like a box, used to collect monetary gifts. The box had a type of funnel at the top, larger at the opening than at the bottom. It was made of metal. So if you were skilled and knew how to toss that coin in just the right way, it would ring out like a trumpet, as Jesus mentions here in verse two. It was very loud. Never give for the applause or approval of others. ""Then,"" He says, ""don't tell others."" Give privately. Don't let others know how much you are giving. Give in secret. Then Jesus says and only then, will you be rewarded."
John 3:16,"('Christmas', 'Salvation', 'Gift')",Baptist," ""In Search of the Perfect Gift"" John 3:16 Some of us have in our lives a person who is very difficult to buy for. Perhaps they already have nearly...you know what do you buy for the guy who has everything? What does Bill Gates' wife get him for Christmas? After all, he is now worth 75 billion dollars. She probably doesn't get him a computer. Or Mark Zuckerberg; his wife probably doesn't send him a note on Facebook. The text I have chosen for today is probably the most quoted verse in all the Bible. Probably the first verse you ever memorized. But I would suggest that none of us have completely grasped the truth of this verse. 1. When we are looking for the perfect gift, one of the first things we consider is need. "" If it's cold and someone doesn't have a coat, you buy a coat. "" If your CD player is broken and you love music, someone might buy you a new CD player. If we see a need, we know what to buy. So if I were to ask you this morning, what is your greatest need right now how many of you would not have to think very long? Perhaps you're having trouble and you think ""I wish Santa would bring me a new car."" Whatever it is it is an easy question to answer. Pour answers usually fall into one of these 4 categories. "" A material need. Car. Clothes. Something that that costs money. "" A physical need. We're ill perhaps. The doctor has given us some news we just don't want to hear. Cancer, maybe. Something that has completely changed everything. And we think God, if you would just heal me or heal my friend---that is all I want/need. I understand that right now. "" An emotional need. Depression. Grief. You've been dealing with it for much too long and you need answers. At this time of year depression affects more people than at any other time. It is often referred to as the Holiday blues or the Christmas blues because it has become so common. At a time when we should have joy and peace we have just the opposite. But there is also a 4th need and it is the need this verse addresses. "" A spiritual need. The Bible teaches that all of us have a sin problem. It's genetic actually. We were born with this terrible disease and it affects all of us. No one get left out. Since the time of our birth we have had a sin nature. Our nature is bent toward sin. You do not have to tell children how to do the wrong thing. You do not have to tell teenagers how to do the wrong thing. It just comes natural. The Bible in fact says ALL have sinned and come short of the standard God has set. ALL. The good news is that since all of us suffer from the same problem-sin-the solution is also the same for ALL of us. 2. So God gave us a gift that would meet this need. Everyone is searching for the same thing. We all have a deep need to know that we matter to someone. That our lives matter to someone. That our lives have made a difference. We want to feel important to someone. Last year the US generated 957 million dollars from online dating services. In many ways they have been helpful. In many ways they have caused problems. I overheard a woman in a store this week who was very excited to announce to her friend that she would be getting married this February. Her friend asked how they met and she said online. Her friend so oh, what's he like? She said, ""Well I haven't met him yet. We will meet in January and then get married in February."""
Mark 4:35-41,"('Fear', 'Peace', 'Storm')",Baptist," ""Finding Peace in the Midst of the Storm"" Mark 4:35-41 If I were to ask you this morning this question--what is the one thing this world needs? What would you say? That question has been posed many times; including in beauty pageants. Here is one featuring Sandra Bullock in the movie Miss congeniality. Look at this brief clip. MOVIE CLIP What is the one thing this world needs? Let's all say it together... ""World peace."" If only it was that easy. I asked my oldest son, David, who is almost 40 and has spent many years working in military intelligence. Asked him this week them how many wars are currently being fought in the world. He said (this week) there are about eight that are actually considered to be wars. There are also about 55 armed conflicts going on. The difference between the two by the way is this-an armed conflict is declared a war once 1000 people have been killed. One more fact. Of the past 3400 years, man has been entirely at peace only 268 of those years. That is 8% of recorded history. Man has always had difficulty finding peace. The disciples did as well. In John 13, Jesus has just identified Judas as the one who will betray him. In addition, he has predicted that Peter, considered to be the leader of the 12; that he will deny Jesus three times. He has also let them know once again that a time will come very soon when he will be leaving. The disciples have built their entire lives around Jesus for over three years-they left jobs and family and other commitments behind to follow him and now he is going away. The last thing the disciples felt was peace. Jesus knew this of course so as he begins to speak the disciples listen to what he has to say... Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid. One word Jesus uses, is the word I RAY NAY which means to join together or to be tied together as a whole. In other words peace often involves taking something that is broken, disconnected, fractured, shattered and putting all the pieces back together. Peace can be about putting pieces together. But it also means something even deeper. And that is what we find in this story today. MARK 4:35-41 Now the Sea of Galilee is only 5 miles wide and 13 miles long but it has a very unique history involving storms. Fact is, it is 600 feet below sea level, so deep in the basin where it fits that cold air and warm air often come together and the result is a huge storm. Jesus had just finished speaking and this was exactly what happened. Jesus had just finished a long day of ministry. He had been confronted by some of the leaders of the day; the crowds were constantly with him, he was teaching them and by now he was likely exhausted. So Jesus took a boat to cross the lake and did what most of us would do. He went to sleep. That was when it seemed that out of nowhere a terrible storm begins. Matthew uses the word seismos, which means earthquake, to describe the storm. This storm was more like a hurricane. Luke tells us it was so bad that the ship was full of water. The waves covered the ship and unless something were to change they were headed for the bottom of the sea. One of the main points of this story to me is this....storms can happen when you least expect them."
James 1:12-18,"('Perseverance', 'Endurance', 'Temptation', 'Testing')",Baptist," Bona Fide A study of James Genuine Christian living Part 4 ""The Temptation within"" Today as we continue our study of James We will continue to connect the dots That James lays out For Bona Fide Christian living We began this series with the pressure test If you will remember we looked at trials and troubles as pressure in our lives And we saw how God uses the pressure to bend us Not break us He does this In order to give us the tools for true spiritual growth and the ability to overcome anything that Satan or the world throw at us Last week we took a quick look at wisdom And discussed the difference between the worlds wisdom and God's wisdom And we saw how surrendering to the worlds wisdom and not accepting and following the wisdom of God in our lives Often causes us to waver To be blown by the winds of this world And we end up like Jake spoon Sitting on a horse with a rope around our necks Today I am going to skip ahead just a little to verses 12-15 of James The verses I am passing by are very important But Like wisdom I plan to cover the topic in those more in depth later in this series But for today I want to look at the cause of pressure The cause of those winds in our lives The root cause of sin And I want to discuss some misconceptions about temptation And then ""get real"" Get Bona Fide On this subject Please open up your bibles to James Chapter 1 Let me start out with verse 12 12 God blesses those who patiently endure testing and temptation. Afterward they will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him. "" This is a recap from week one We saw how when we overcome the pressure When we pass the test We receive the blessing that God has for us He uses Listen Uses Key on the word uses here Trials Troubles and pressure in our lives to produce endurance Perseverance In order to strengthen us Grow us Give us the tools to get it done Remember I told you just a moment ago to key on the word uses God uses trials to grow us But he does not send the temptations that cause the trials He tests us But he does not tempt us Let's read verse 13 13 And remember, when you are being tempted, do not say, ""God is tempting me."" God is never tempted to do wrong,[a] and he never tempts anyone else. Many people want to blame God for tempting them when the wheels fall off of their lives But James Jesus' brother James Shows us in scripture that this just ain't true He says That God never tempts anyone to do evil There is no evil in God None And he will not and cannot use evil to tempt anyone So that excuse won't hold water So we tend to move on to other excuses for our temptations and our surrender to them ""It's not my fault"" ""I couldn't help it"" ""It was just a mistake"" ""Everyone else is doing it"" ""Nobody's perfect"" ""I didn't know it was wrong"" ""I was pressured into it"" Or one of the most common excuse ""The Devil made me do it"""
Ephesians 2:8-10,"('Purpose', 'Destiny', 'Calling')",Baptist," ""Made on Purpose, for a Purpose"" Ephesians 2:8-10 There are several words or phrases I could use that depending on the generation you grew up in, you would know exactly what I mean. "" I am trying to find myself "" I want to find my destiny "" Lord what is my calling "" Lord do I have a purpose? These four statements are really just four different ways of saying the same thing. This morning I want you to really focus and listen as I read from the Scripture but I'm going to ask you to do something different. I want you to bow your head and close your eyes right now and I want to read some verses of Scripture from God's Word and I want you to visualize that God is speaking these words directly to you. Genesis 1:27 (NLT) 27 So God created human beings in his own image. In the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. Proverbs 20:5 (ESV) 5 The purpose in a man's heart is like deep water, but a man of understanding will draw it out. Proverbs 20:5 (NIV) 5 The purposes of a person's heart are deep waters, but one who has insight draws them out. Jeremiah 29:11 (NLT) 11 For I know the plans I have for you,"" says the Lord. ""They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope. Ephesians 2:10 (NLT) 10 For we are God's masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago. Ephesians 1:5 (NLT) 5 God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ. This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure. Psalm 139:13 (NIV) 13 For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb Jeremiah 1:5 (NLT) 5 ""I knew you before I formed you in your mother's womb. Before you were born I set you apart Proverbs 19:21 (NLT) 21 You can make many plans, but the Lord's purpose will prevail. Prayer. Let me ask you three questions this morning. (1) Does God have a purpose for everyone? (2) Does God want me to know what my purpose is? (3) Is it possible to go all the way through life and not understand my purpose? The answer to all three of these questions is yes. Yes, God has a purpose for every person here today. Yes God want you to know exactly what it is. Yes, it is possible to go completely through life and miss your purpose. Look with me at several truths this morning. 1. First of all you are made in God's image. The creator of this world created light and at t the end of the first day H said ""this is good."" On the second day he created the sky and said ""it was good."" This continues for three more days as he created the universe we live in and each day He paused and looked at his creation and simply said, this is good. It is on the sixth day, the final day of creation that He then created man in his image... You will notice he says in our likeness. That is a reference to the Trinity. Father. Son. Holy Spirit. All present from the beginning. But His response on this day is different this time it is...""very good."" The Milky Way is only one galaxy in our universe. Astronomers are now telling us that the universe holds as many as 200 billion galaxies. Beyond anything we can comprehend. Yet God says that when he made man, that mankind was his crowning achievement. He made this universe, the animals, as far as we can see and beyond what we can imagine yet man is the only one that was made in his image. Now what does that mean? Well it does not mean that we look like him. God is spirit. When we are made in the image of God, it means that God gives us the ability to be able to communicate with him. That privilege is not given to the stars as astrology teaches. That privilege was not given to the earth as New Age philosophy teaches. That privilege is only given to man. You and I have the ability to be able to communicate with the God of this universe-because we are made in his image."
Mark 5:1-20,"('Christ', 'Obedience', 'Liberation', 'Demon Possession')",Evangelical Free," Last week we noted from Mark 4 that during a boat trip, Jesus taught His followers about faith. Faith is basically completely trusting what Jesus said by taking action accordingly until what was said is accomplished. Faith can be defined this way: Faith is believing what God says and putting it to action till completion! We asked ourselves last week ""How can I build my faith?"" And so, let us continue to build our faith by listening to what God wants to tell us from Mark 5:1-20..... v1-5: What type of person greeted Jesus? A person(s) possessed by demons met Jesus; lived in the tombs, could not be handled physically, in pain, and causes himself pain. We can note that demons are real! What can we say about demons based on this?? - can possess people - many can be in the same spot/person - prefers to live among the dead - can empower people physically - looks for ways to cause pain on people v6-8: Who was speaking to Jesus?? - a legion of demons! What did it know about Jesus?? - Son of God - Has power to judge demons - Has power to liberate a person from demons v13: Jesus allowed the demons to possess pigs who killed themselves. The passage does not tell us exactly what happen to the demons except they definitely left the person(s). Why did Jesus allow the demons to go to the pigs? - We can note at least 2 reasons: - Jesus freed the person(s) from demon possession. - v14-16?? - Jesus wanted the people to know what happened! But how did the people respond to Jesus? v15-17: The people were afraid and kicked Jesus out of town! Why do you think?? The people were comfortable with evil and they didn't want to follow Jesus! But in contrast, what can we note about the healed person in v18-20?? The healed person(s) begged to follow Jesus! Jesus challenged the healed person(s) to testify! The healed person(s) obeyed Jesus and impacted many people! What Biblical principles must we note from this passage? 1. We must not be spiritually blind to powerful demons who can possess people! 2. Jesus Christ, available to every person, has power over all demons! Based on these 2 biblical principles, what can we summarize?? If a person do not have Jesus Christ in their lives, they are susceptible to evil influences! And, what can we note about the people in general in this passage?? 3. People refusing Jesus Christ should not surprise us. And finally, what can we note from the healed person which we can apply to our Christian lives?? 4. We Christians should always have a desire to be with Jesus and a willingness to obey Him!"
2 Kings 5:1-27,"('Humility', 'Leprosy', 'Arrogance', 'Miracle')",Independent/Bible," The Leprosy Exchange (2 Kings 5:1-27) 1. Probably every one of us thinks, ""I hope I never get to a condition where other people have to take care of me because I am bedfast."" 2. But the future is unknown, and life can take a sudden turn. Take Charles Krauthammer, a political analyst many respect: Krauthammer became permanently paralyzed after a diving accident while in his first year studying at Harvard Medical School. After spending 14 months recovering in a hospital, and although wheelchair-bound, he returned to medical school, graduating to become a psychiatrist involved in the creation of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III, and later developing a career as a Pulitzer prize-winning writer. He is a contributing editor to the Weekly Standard and a nightly panelist on Fox News Channel's Special Report with Bret Baier. He was a weekly panelist on PBS news program Inside Washington from 1990 until it ceased production in December 2013. 3. Not everyone has the brains to opportunity to pursue such a career after that kind of an injury. It is pretty rare. 4. About 2800 years ago, a well-respected Syrian general was afflicted with leprosy. His name was Naaman. And, as we shall see, God used his afflicted to do a work of grace in his heart. But he had to be humbled, first. Main Idea: When we humble ourselves, we can draw near to God and be blessed by Him. When we elevate ourselves or self-interest, we are driven from Him and under his discipline. I. Naaman: A Great Man Who HUMBLED Himself (1-15) A. Naaman and his AFFLICTION (1-2) "" The Hebrew word is a broad term for a variety of skin conditions B. Naaman seeks to be CURED (3-12) About 2.5 million dollars today. 1. Humiliating: seeking help from a country he had probably helped attack 2. He was at the mercy of foreigners 3. He was given the run around Aaron T. Lockhart writes, ""Naaman felt that he had to travel all this way only to be redirected by a fearful king, snubbed by a silent prophet (whom Naaman no doubt regarded as a lesser man than he), and instructed by a servant to bathe in a dirty river."" C. Naaman cured PHYSICALLY and spiritually (13-15) D. Naaman wants to live as an obedient BELIEVER in a pagan environment (16-19a) Andrew Drury points out that in today's text, everyone is out of their comfort zones. "" A slave girl extracted from Israel and now a servant in Syria. "" Elisha, leading a counter-cultural movement back toward Yahweh. "" Naaman, a Syrian genral who is forced to visit Israel to be killed "" The king in Israel who is afraid of more incursions by the king of Syria. But sometimes God shakes things up and takes us out of our comfort zone, and it is only then we will listen to him. Anne LaMott: ""There's a lovely Hasidic story of a rabbi who always told his people that if they studied the Torah, it would put Scripture on their hearts. One of them asked, ""Why on our hearts, and not in them?"" The rabbi answered, ""Only God can put Scripture inside. But reading sacred text can put it on your heart, and then when your hearts break, the holy words will fall inside."""
"Romans 1:27-28, Hosea 4:6","(""God's Sovereign Will"", 'God Is In Control', 'God Is More Than Able')",Pentecostal," Theme : THE WORD Text: Job 22:22, Hebrews 4:12 From our text..in Job..we were encourage and prayed for to recieve the Law from His mouth , and lay up His words in our heart. The law is also describe as the instructional manual of God for mankind. So deviating from such is so devastating and might lead to regrets and shame of an individual, knowing fully well that the true revelations of who we are is embeded in the Law of God and not the speculation or scientific theory of what man think of us. Lamentation 3:37 First and foremost let us get a clear interpretations of the word. In the old testament the word of God implied both a word about God and a word from God. In effect the word of God refers to what God says and at the same time describe God, His essence and attribute. The new testament on the other hand, present the word of God as a person, the second person of the trinity the Lord Jesus, who was with the father from the begining of creation. Gen 1:26.. Colosians 1:16-18, I paraphrase everything that exist and will ever exist has it begining from the word, without it nothing was made that is made and was meant to bring Him glory.. Now this is the big question, how does the word of God relates to our theme from the begining "" YOU CAN KEEP DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND EXPECTS A DIFFERENT RESULT "" IGNORANCE..Taking this phrase into consideration there is a wrong at work, hence our text for today in Job 22:22, will give us the right insight to apply and overcome such error. Starting a year that a word through prophecy (Open doors of pleasant surprises) from the throne of grace has been set in place for dominance, failure to walk in line of the originator of such prophecy, rob you of it benefits irrespective of your existence during the set time of the word, for eg (2kings 7:1-20). A man heard the prophecy, doubt and mock the word and was trampled upon because of his disbelief and mockery, I pray for you the grace to belief and walk in faith the Lord will grant unto you and make you a beneficiary of it blessing in Jesus Name. Yesterday we learn that inorder for us to have a better tomorrow, we need to acquiant and align our ways to the Lord, in other words we need to sync our life with the purpose and plans of God (Prov 19:21), and let go of our perspective and the way of the norms, then our open door this year will be achieved and fulfilled. Remember John 11:25, I paraphrase states a word from God can revive a dead destiny, as the dead destiny of Lazarus ressurected by the ressurrection and life, I hereby decree before this month comes to an end, Your life will recieve a word that will cause man to celebrate with you in Jesus Name. Today we are told in verse 22 of Job 22 to recieve the word and lay it on our heart..why do we need such discipline and how can we obtain and live in such discipline; 1. We must Recieve the Word; Without the reception of the word , one destiny becomes dead and stagnant irrespective of who you are.. Is the amount of information you have that enable dominion in a particular sphere of life. what you recieve and feed on you turn to believe and behave..Rom 10:17"
"Job 22:22-21:28, James 4:7-8","('Drawing Near To God', 'Align To The Ways Of God')",Pentecostal," Theme: Acquaint thyself with the Lord Text: Job 22:21; Isa 48:17 The word aquaintance means to know or get familiar with something or somebody. Phil 3:10..Paul illustrates how vital knowledge of the Lord is to a believer. Knowledge is power but detrimental in the hands or mind of the wrong person. Wisdom is authority. I would like to explain why paul emphasizes on not just knowing the Lord but also the power of His resurrection. It was the resurection that completed the joy of His mission, so in other words for our joy to be full this year we need not just to know the Lord but His ressurection as well thus enabling us to apply wisdom in our dealings. Many have got so familiar with God therefore compromising His standards which is devoid of respect for Him. Power which comes from knowledge can be guarantee and genuine when it is authorize. Take for instance a man has a gun, he has power but if not authorized to use and he is caught using will be arrested, so is the same with power which is gain from knowledge. Like it is clearly stated Paul long after the ressurrection, talks about the solution, seeking wisdom as followers of Christ will be much more better than knowledge because in so doing we will be authorize and our God will be pleased. We are so specific about our theme..that speaks ""You can not keep doing the same thing and have different result"" ..so how can acquainting ourselves to the Lord open unto us a new door.? Matt 11:28 says and I paraphrase come just as you are with your load and burden, I am capable of giving you full rest. Remember in our text in Job 22:21, when you acquaint then peace come which brings goodness/open doors.. from that error made by many christians doing the same or living the same way and expecting a different result, there must be a change of orientation and approach this year as regards our resolution and such change should coincide with the Lord then we are guarantee a success this year by His grace. However let us look at what Job, a contemporary of Moses have to offer us to change our orientation and approach this 2017.. HOW DO I ACQUAINT MYSELF TO THE LORD..James 4:8..says and I paraphrase Knowledge of the Lord comes when you are closely intimated with Him and His presence. Rom 8:16, says and I paraphrase..it is the spirit of God in you that shows that you are His own and can lead you to Him, which connote intimacy..Are you??? As it is clearly noted a son that stick closer to the father enjoy and benefits a lot more from the father than the others.. Ps 91:1, Rom 10:17. This is my question to you all: How much of your time you spend in His presence in your past years, be not decieve this year, God will only go the extra miles for those that will value His presence, not just visitors but dweller, much more obedient dwellers..In His presence there is liberty, and His word carries power. Isa 9:8, John 11:25, says..He is a word that transform and the ressurrection and life, I hereby decree, that very word that will open unto you doors of great opportunity and the ability to enjoy and be a blessing this year the Lord will give you this very season in Jesus Name and everything that has died due to your distance from His kingdom, this year as you prioritise Him, He shall give life to it and empower you to recover all your lost ground in Jesus Name. 1sam 30:6-8 Cletus Blamo commented on Jan 30, 2017 I my very self when the Lord open up these revelations to me..it helps me to reorganize and amend my ways before Him..so I am bless i must admit and I hope it will inspire and redirect your motives as you reflects on His plans for you this year..God bless

Zechariah 10:1-8,"('Prosperity', 'Breakthrough Prayer')",Pentecostal," TEXT ASK FOR RAIN ZECHARIAH 10:1-10 Sometimes God speaks things to us that don't make any sense, sometimes they just seem to be out of order. This text is an example of that: God says ask for rain in the time of the latter rain, now to my natural mind that doesn't make any sense. Why would you need to ask for rain when it's raining? that doesn't make any sense at all. Thats like walking outside and standing in the pouring rain and looking up to the sky and saying: I sure wish it would rain. But the truth is: This is spiritual and what God is saying is this; there are seasons of visitation, there are times of refreshing, there are times when God manifest his presence and his power and His glory to his people. But the only ones that will benefit from that, and the only ones that will be blessed by the rain and blessed by the presence of God and the manifestation of his glory, are those who ask for the rain. In a spiritual sense you don't get wet just because it's raining, (you have to ask for the rain). You have to put a demand on God. You have to let God know that you need the rain, and that you want the rain, and that you will not be satisfied without the rain. You must position yourself to receive the rain: It doesn't matter what God is doing, if you are out of position you will miss it. Attitude has a lot to do with positioning, because in a spiritual sense your attitude determines your position. For example: God is manifesting his presence, his power is being manifested, glory is filling the atmosphere) but your attitude says (I don't like these songs, or i don't like that sermon, or i can't wait till service is over so i can go eat) Well you may be physically in the right place, but if your attitude is wrong you are spiritually in the wrong place. The bible says: Repent then times of refreshing will come from the presence of the Lord. I want to tell you something: I love you with all my heart, and i want to be the best pastor I can be, but God didn't send me here to make freinds, and to eat chicken, and to pat everybody on the back and say: your ok i'm ok, we're all ok. I am here in the divine plan of God and destiny over this church (to push you, to build you, to equip you, to train you, to empower you) to help you position yourself to receive all that God has for you and to walk in his anointing and power. And that means sometimes you'll get uncomfortable, because growth means stretching, and growth means change, and if my preaching and teaching never challenges you, then I'm wasting my breath and your wasting your time. But I believe in the power of the gospel, and i believe, when i line myself up with the word (the blessings of God come like rain) We're not trying to get anything from you: We're trying to get Gods blessing to you. I don't talk about tithing because I'm trying to get your money) I talk about about it because if I don't God will hold me personally responsible for witholding his truth from you. We're entering a season of divine prosperity: There has been a major shift in the Spiritual climate. Paul Thomas Buckmaster Adams commented on Feb 7, 2017 Praise God, I'm so happy to see you posting again, your sermons have been a God send, we are in the same vein concerning the prophetic and our preaching styles. My last two dozen messages were inspired by revelations shown to me in your sermons. Thank you for your unadulterated non diluted 180 proof truth, I felt like I was on an island with my preaching until someone said, check this guy out, you guys sound alike, LOL.
God bless you brother !

"Job 36:11-22:23, 1 Corinthians 3:9-10","('God', 'God Is Great', 'God  Working For Good')",Pentecostal," Theme: The master Builder Text: Psalms 127:1, Job 22:23-24, Our God is the master builder..if you read Exo 1:21, He build houses for the midwives, because they chose to obey Him instead of pharoah who had a negative plans for the birth of male child due to the prophesy that was unfold concerning tje deliverer of God's people. He also build cities..Heb 11:10. He make and remake everything. He specializes in building people's life, 1cor 3:9. Until you subconciously absorbed that He is the builder of your life, consciously you will always find yourself in guilt when there's a damage done to you. Like any master builder he builds according to plan. Let take a deep studies on this scripture in Ps 33:8-11, Rev 1:8, and see the attribute of our Master builder and why we should be confident enough in Him, like I was studying one of my morning devotion, which speaks of the pathway of fools. Only fool sees all these beautiful creation and in his folly acknowledge tha there is no God talkless of Him building his life. The very end of such life is disasterous irrespective of what he has achieved or gathered (Prov 23:5, ps 14:1).. so open with me in Ps 33:8-11 From this scripture ..it is clearly stated 1. when God speak it is done..ps 62:11, Rom 9:15-16. You need a spoken word inorder to have your world form. In Genesis 1:3, the earth was void and empty but at the spoken word, the Spirit moves upon the water, and the emptiness and darkness became full with light. I hereby decree to your life by the Power of the spoken word, recieve life and light in your chaotic situation in Jesus Name. The Lord builds by speaking. Today He shall speak to your life and every unabandoned project shall be perfected in Jesus Name. 1peter 5:10 2. He makes the plans and devices of the heathen non effective. God has the power to frustrate the dealings of the wicked, because He sees their dealings. Whoever is mandated to frustrate your open doors this year shall all fail in Jesus Name. Job 5:12, Exo 14:14. Isaiah 44:25-26 3. State that the counsel of God stands forever. The counsel of the Lord is the guarantee tool you need inorder to rearrange and reverse every damage done to your destiny. Remember Christ on Calvary paid that very price for you, so instead of calculating, analysing, murmuring and complaining, just surrender and obey Him fully and your broken walls shall be rebuild in Jesus Name. Jere 29:11, 3rd John 2, deut 7:14. Are you believing God for conception and delivery before April this year you will take in and in nine months time you shall bring forth your joy in Jesus Name. Are you unemploy, or unfruitful in your work, this year, the Lord shall be merciful, make you an employer and make you fruitful in Jesus Name. Now we are fully aware of who our God is and what He is capable of doing, so lets us go to our phrase ( "" SOME KEEP DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND EXPECT A DIFFERENT RESULT"" IGNORANCE,) and also see from Job 22:23-24, how can we benefit from the teaching of Job in changing our orientation so we can access our open doors and become relevant and a true blessing to others."
Revelation 12:1-17,"('Child', 'Dragon', 'Book Of Revelation', ""The Woman's Offspring"")",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 8/12/16 Series:Verse By Verse Through Revelation Lesson: IV .A.1: The Woman, Child, Dragon, and Rest of the Woman's Offspring (12:1-17) Revelation 12:1-17 (KJV) 1 And there appeared a great wonder in Heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: 2 And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered. 3 And there appeared another wonder in Heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. 4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of Heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born. 5 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne. 6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days. 7 And there was war in Heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, 8 And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in Heaven. 9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. 10 And I heard a loud voice saying in Heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. 11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. 12 Therefore rejoice, ye Heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. 13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child. 14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. 15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood. 16 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth. 17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. Introduction This book of revelation is one of the most wonderful in all the Word of God, and the chapter before us is one of the most picturesque in the book. It is the great ""sign"" chapter. The word ""wonder"" in verses 1 and 3 is ""semeion,"" translated ""sign"" in the Revised Version, and used here for the first time in the Revelation. There are two ""wonders"" (or signs) in this chapter, the first being a ""great wonder"" and the second called ""another wonder."""
Matthew 5:13-20,"('Super Bowl', 'Game')",Methodist," Go Team! Super bowl Sunday! The Patriots take on the Falcons in a head to head battle. Both teams have worked hard to get to this level of play and it will all be decided tonight. If you don't care for football, there are other teams playing for your attention. Advertisers have spent millions of dollars producing entertaining commercials displaying their products for you to buy. And then paying millions more to air them during the Super bowl. And the halftime show is expected to be longer and bigger than ever. All in all, they expect 184 million people to tune into the game tonight. And it is a very big deal to those who want to get the message out about their products. In fact, those numbers are much more important to more people than the score of the game or a Super Bowl ring. Such importance on things that in the long run, just doesn't matter. I look at these events and wonder, if we could just hold a worship service that would draw as many people to Christ. When I owned the Ice Cream Truck, it had a music box that played several songs over and over again. At first it was OK. Then it became annoying. Finally, I could just ignore it all together. But the people who would hear the truck go by would not. They would run to catch the truck, they would follow it in their cars. Children would jump out in the middle of the street. (That is why I had to be super careful and drive super slow.) And all the time while this would happen I would wonder, what would happen if people were as excited to hear the church bell on Sunday mornings? The Falcons have 73 people play on their team. The Patriots have 67 players. So, 140 people need to be at their very best this afternoon. That is a big difference than the 184 million people that will be watching them. The 184 million have no impact on the outcome of the game. That depends solely on the team players. The battle will be fought by them but the impact will be felt around the world. It is a big thing. And each team member knows how important it is to give 100%. (They may say it but you can't do better than that) When it comes to Jesus' team, our team, the stakes are much higher. Jesus did not come to entertain but to save. And he depends on his team, us to spread the Gospel for the transformation of the world. And we need to give our mission 100%. 13 ""You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot. 14 ""You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. 15 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. 16 In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven. Jesus is saying that our effort needs to be 100%. Halfhearted faith is as useless and selfish as lighting a light only to cover it with a bowl to keep it from shining. Faith is meant to be shared. We are not to stay children who take flashlights into bed so that they can shine it under the covers."
Mark 5:21-34,"('Love', 'Ministry', 'Others')",Christian/Church Of Christ," The 3 C's of a Healthy Church - Hurting People are in the Crowd Mark 5:21-34 (p. 702) February 5, 2017 Introduction: I saw this meme on my Facebook page that said, ""Be kind for everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about."" SHOW PICTURE I discovered that truth long ago...In every single crowd is someone whose marriage is shattered...In every single crowd is someone grieving the loss of someone they love...In every single crowd is someone who has been abused or is struggling with addiction...In every single crowd is someone who is hurting physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. Every one of us here today has been shocked by a marriage ending that we thought was rock solid. Every one of us has experienced the pain of a friend or family member who reaches a time when they can no longer hide the battle they face with pornography, or alcohol or some other issue they have tried to hide from people. In this crowd this morning, I promise you, there are people who are at the end of their strength, because they spent all they have emotionally to try and fix the problem on their own, searching for a miracle. Some think they are looking for love. Some think they are looking for money. Some think they are looking for a new opportunity. Some are looking for answers. Some are looking for fulfillment. But what they are really looking for is a miracle! Third Day has an amazing song entitled, ""I Need a Miracle"". The first verse and chorus says, Well, late one night she started to cry and thought he ain't coming home. She was tired of his lies, tired of the fight, but she didn't want to see him go. She fell on her knees and said, ""I haven't prayed since I was young, but Lord above I need a miracle."" (And then the chorus says) Well no matter who you are and no matter what you've done, there will come a time when you can't make it on your own. And in your hour of desperation know you're not the only one. Praying Lord above, I need a miracle. There are many common denominators found in this woman in our text, and every single one of us need a miracle. The reason that the gospel is ""Good News"" is that Jesus can provide that miracle. It's why those of us who have experienced His power are compelled to share the gospel. What is the first element in the life of someone who needs a miracle? I. DESPERATION In this large crowd following...In front, pressing on him is a woman who had been hemorrhaging blood for 12 years. She had seen doctor after doctor. She is suffering and she has emptied her bank account trying to get better, but instead of getting better she kept getting worse. She is weak, she is anemic, she is pale. She has reached the end of her rope and has no energy left. You and I know she has experienced depression and is discouraged dealing with this sickness for 12 years. And not only that, because the Hebrew law considers her ""unclean"" she would have experienced ""social isolation."""
"Isaiah 61:3, Psalms 34:18","('Healing', 'Health', 'Spiritual First Aid', ""Mending What's Broken"")",Foursquare," Spiritual First Aid Manual Mending What's Broken Every human being is broken. We're all broken people. And that's because we are all sinners because of the fall humanity took back in the Garden of Eden. At the start of creation we were brand new, God said let us make man in our image and according to our likeness, but sin entered and broke what God had created. The fall broke us. We were in the beginning whole and complete, but sin broke us where now we're nothing more than a shell of our former selves. Because of that everything in our lives is broken. We're broken physically and spiritually and sin has devastated our bodies where now sickness, disease, and death await us all. In fact earth itself is broken because of sin, and is groaning for its redemption through all these natural disasters. (Romans 8:22) Broken can also best describes our marriages and families, not to mention our spirit and heart. It's all broken because of sin and the fall of man. But God is in the healing business and wants to mend what's broken. Listen to what Job said, ""My spirit is broken, my days are extinguished, the grave is ready for me."" (Job 17:1 NKJV) Now, that's not an encouraging statement, but though the prophet Isaiah, this is what is said about Jesus' purpose. ""The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me, because the Lord has anointed me to preach good news to the poor...He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted."" (Isaiah 61:3 NKJV) It is this very Scripture that Jesus quoted about Himself and how God had sent Him to heal what was broken within us. (Luke 4:18) How does God go about this mending process? He does so by getting personally involved in our lives. King David said, ""The LORD is near to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit."" (Psalm 34:18 NIV) But these breaks are not always a bad thing. Sometimes God breaks us so that He can remake us, so our lives can mend the right way. Nathan the prophet came to David and told him of God's displeasure when he sinned in his adulterous affair with Bathsheba. Because of the consequences of his actions, David cried out, ""Make me to hear joy and gladness, let the bones which You have broken rejoice."" (Psalm 51:8 NKJV) And then David went on to say, ""The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise."" (Psalm 51:17 NKJV) This breaking process is so that God can remake us into His image and likeness as seen in what the Lord told Jeremiah in how He, the Lord, is the potter and we are the clay. ""And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter; so he made it again into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make."" (Jeremiah 18:4 NKJV) As the Potter, God has the power over our lives to break and remake us into vessels of honor, that is, to remake our lives into that which will give Him glory. The Trinity Effect When it comes to healing, believers and the church far too often look only at the spiritual man, thinking that a spiritual healing will heal what's important while leaving the rest of the person's life broken."
"Psalms 91:1-16, Matthew 11:27-28","(""God's Presence"", ""The Lord's Banner"", ""The Lord's Presence"")",Pentecostal," Theme: Thy Presence Text: psalms 24:3-4, Job 22:25-26 Remember this year has been declare by the Lord as a year of surprises and it will come as a coin with two side. For the sons of God it will be an open doors of pleasant surprises while to the wicked a surprise of shame, nakedness, total disgrace and permanent destruction. But I pray for you throughout this year the grace to please the Lord will be release to you and you shall access your open doors with great joy in Jesus Name. Prov 16:7.. Let take a look at our phrase "" YOU CAN KEEP DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND EXPECT A DIFFERENT RESULT"" IGNORANCE"" And how does it relates to our theme ""THY PRESENCE"" and that of the instruction of Job in Job 22:25-26.. In that scripture Job pointed that the Almighty God shall be our defence..God can never defend a man out of His presence..and if He is going to be our defence then we must delight in Him, Ps 37:23.. It Is Always A Great Experience To Be In God's Presence, Because The Fullness Of Joy And Everlasting Pleasures Reside There. Psalm 16:11b Says: ""...In Thy Presence Is Fulness Of Joy; At Thy Right Hand There Are Pleasures For Evermore."" However, The State Of Our Lives Determines What We Derive From God's Presence. According To Psalm 68:2-3, While The Righteous Receive Joy In God's Presence, The Enemies Of God Or Those With Wicked Schemes Will Melt Like Wax Before The Fire Of His Presence. The presence of God is the most save place on earth. Guarantee of this safety is describe in Proverb 18:10, which says the name of Jesus is a strong towel, the righteous runs into it and are save. Let this sink into your subconcious not only in the church is where the presence of God is but everywhere and in everything you do, if you acknowledge Him hearfeltly in humility of mind, His presence envelope and engulve you. May the good Lord begin to find you worthy of His presence this very year in Jesus Name. Like Ps 16:11 states it.. Joy and pleasures are virtues which can not be found anywhere except in His presence. Some might argue about pleasure, trust me the pleasures of this worldly living can never be compare to the pleasure of God. With This Knowledge Of The Potency Of God's Presence, Every Child Of God Should Desire At All Times To Be In His Presence. Nevertheless, You Don't Enter The Presence Of A King Just Anyhow; There Are Certain Protocols You Must Follow. How Much More, When Entering The Presence Of The King Of Kings? How Then Do We Enter God's Presence? We enter by the following: Thanksgiving and praise. We should always in gratitude of who our God is and what He has done and is capable of doing enter and acknowledge His presence. Ps 100:4 Many enter the presence of God day in day out without any benefits to show because they were nonchallant and carry away by activities. Let use Lk 10:38-42 as a template to explain the mistake of so many believers and why they have'nt enjoy the fullness of God's presence. It was a Visit of the Lord Jesus to the house of these two beautiful ladies, Mary Marthalyne and Mary. Quite surprisingly these two ladies was previliege to have the master coming into their dwelling. However, there is one thing to come into His presence and another to have Him come to your abode. A wise man said, praises and worship enable you access to His presence while worship bring you to His feet thus creating much intimacy. I pray you will not only benefits from just enetering into His presence but He shall share and unfold deep secrets that will lead to your fulfillment this year in Jesus Name. Marthalyne chose to do something good, hospitality, which the Lord admire but when she was provoke and annoy with Mary saying why Mary left her alone to do the hospitality and has gone to sit at Jesus' feet, then Christ responded to Martha, O martha you are carry away with so many things..though it is good but Mary has chosen the right thing and it can not be taken from her. The truth is this probably she might not have such glorious opportunity of intimacy with the Lord again. This is the lesson for us believers have to take to full consideration this year. You may be doing the good, easy and acceptable thing in the church or His presence but ask yourself am I doing what is right and require from the master Jesus. I pray the Lord open up our eyes this season to do what is right in His presence in Jesus Name. From that teaching it is obvious and clear that though many go to the presence of the Lord but they are doing the good thing instead of the right thing like Martha. They are carry away by activities and hence they lack the intimacy which has the ability to catapote their destiny, destroy all the wrongs and unfold to them the works of the enemy. Take for example, some will tell you I only go to the church for the worship and I am not too interesting in the rest of the service, while some during the time of the message/sermon will be doing selfie and taking the pastor or the choruster pictures which is good but not the right reason you are into His presence. I am praying for a reader of this message, that the Lord will enable you to do the right thing this year in His presence in Jesus Name. Like i told you before intimacy unfold a lot secret to the one involve. I pray for you throughout this year you will reignite your passion and be focus in His presence in Jesus Name."
Matthew 5:13-20,"('Light', 'Darkness', 'Salt', 'Salt And Light', 'Light And Darkness')",Anglican," For those not familiar with an Anglican Service there are four Scripture readings prior to the Message. Today's assigned readings are: Isaiah 58:1-12; Psalm 112:1-10; 1 Corinthians 2:1-16 and Matthew 5:13-20. A quiet forest dweller ... lived in the mountains ... high above ... a Swiss village ... along the eastern slopes ... of the Alps. The elderly gentleman ... had been hired many years ago, by the town council ... to clear away debris ... from the pools of water ... that fed the lovely spring ... flowing through their town. With faithful, ... silent regularity, ... he patrolled the hills, ... removing leaves and branches, ... and clearing away the silt ... that would otherwise choke ... and contaminate .... the Fresh flow ... of water. By and by, ... the village became ... a popular attraction ... for vacationers. Swans ... floated along the crystal-clear spring, ... ...mill wheels of various businesses located along the waterway ... turned ... with regularity. The Farmlands were irrigated, ... and the views from the towns ... eating establishments ... were picturesque ... beyond description. Years passed. (Pause) One evening ... the town council met ... for its semiannual meeting. As they reviewed the budget, ... one man's eye caught the salary figure being paid ... to the obscure keeper ... of the mountain spring. Said the towns treasure, ... ""Who is this old man? Why do we keep him on ... year after year? No one ever sees him. For all we know ... this ranger of the hills ... is doing us ... no good. He isn't necessary ... any longer!"" By a unanimous vote, ... they dispensed with ... the old man's services. For several weeks, ... nothing really changed. By early autumn ... the trees began to shed their leaves. Small branches snapped off and fell into the pools, ... hindering the rushing flow ... of sparkling water. One afternoon ... the townsfolk noticed a slight yellowish-brown tint ... in the spring. A few days later ... the water was ... much darker. Within another week, ... a slimy film covered sections of the water ... and a foul odor ... was soon detected. The mill wheels moved slower, ... some finally ground to a halt. Swans left the town ... as did ... the tourists. The Clammy fingers of disease and sickness .... ...reached deep ... into the village. Quickly, ... the embarrassed council ... called a special meeting. Realizing their gross error in judgment, ... they hired back the old keeper ... of the spring. Within a few weeks .... the veritable ... river of life ...began to clear up. The wheels started to turn, ... and new life returned once again...to the hamlet ... in the Alps. (Pause) This story ... is more than ... an idle tale. It carries with it ... a vivid ... relevant analogy ... directly related ... to the times ... in which we live. Beloved ... What the keeper of the springs meant to the Swiss village, ... The followers of the Christ ... ...Christians ... mean ... to this world. Christians may seem unimportant, Or ... a nuisance to the world, ... to many who do not believe."
Genesis 1:1-31,"('Apologetics', 'Apologetics Creator', 'The Trinity', 'All  Powerful God', 'Divine Providence')",Baptist," ""The Prime Cause"" Genesis 1:1 Gen 1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. 3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. 5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. 6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. 7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. 8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. 9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. 10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. 11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. 12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. 13 And the evening and the morning were the third day. 14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: 15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. 16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. 17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. 19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. 20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. 21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. 22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. 23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. 24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. 25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. 26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. 29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. 30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. 31 And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day."
Song of Songs 8:4-14,"('Deliverance', 'Wilderness Experience')",Christian Missionary Alliance," Song of Solomon 8:4-14 Some people think they have arrived when in fact they have only just begun their journey. An Olympian athlete will spend years preparing and training for an event at the Olympics. That event may only take a few moments and then it is over. In some regards, it does not seem like it is really worth it. Years and years of training for one brief moment of victory. Some may look at the Christian life like that. And in some cases, it might be closer to the truth than anything else. But that brief moment is only possible because of years and years of practice and training. (1941-1974), struggled in her singing career until she became part of a group known as the Mamas and the Papas. This group lasted less than three years and then they disbanded. Cass began her solo career and it was very rocky. She went to London, married a barren and restarted her career. She was not very successful and the audiences were very slim. Then, it started to come together and the concert halls became packed and they gave her standing ovations. She called Michelle Phillips after the final concert on July 28, (1974) elated that she had received standing ovations each night. She then retired for the evening and died in her sleep, at age 32, two months before her 33rd birthday, due to heart failure. When she went to bed that night she thought her career was just starting but she never knew that that was her last concert. In some ways, the Christian life is like that. We struggle and struggle and finally become victorious and then it's all over. When we delight in divine companionship, we believe that we have arrived. In a certain sense, we have but not the way we think. Up until this divine companionship element of our Christian experience, our struggles have to do with the sin element in our life. I know we never truly get rid of that while we are here on earth, but there comes a point when we get beyond those struggles. Unfortunately, many Christians do not get beyond those struggles. Many Christians do not know nor have they experienced this divine companionship that is so prevalent in the Song of Solomon. A relationship not based on desperation. Song of Solomon 8:5 (NLV) ""Who is this coming up from the desert, resting on her loved one?"" (KJV) ""Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? What we have here is what I am calling The Wilderness Syndrome. One translation calls it the desert while the other calls it the wilderness. I am going to use the term wilderness because that is a little more to term. This Wilderness Syndrome is a very important aspect of the Christian life illustrated in both the Old and New Testaments. Very many Christians do not understand this aspect of the Christian life today. We have the idea that the Christian life is just one smooth ride right into heaven. No facts or experiences, even suggest this kind of thing. Theme... Our wilderness experience is a testimony of our divine companionship. In fact, it proves the reality of this companionship."
"1 Peter 3:18-22, Ephesians 4:8-10","('Hell', 'Vindication', 'Second  Chance')",Baptist," One question that I have been asked by many people, many times is, ""Where in the Bible does talk about Jesus descending to hell to preach to the people and what exactly does it mean?"" The first problem many have is that they have heard about the verses but no one seems to know where to find it. The incident is lightly mentioned in Ephesians 4:8-10. But the meat of the issue is found in 1 Peter 3:18-22. Let's first look at Ephesians 4:8-10. Now let's turn to 1 Peter 3 and look at verses 18-22. 18 For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit; 19 in which also He went and made proclamation to the spirits now in prison, 20 who once were disobedient, when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through the water. 21 Corresponding to that, baptism now saves you--not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience--through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,22 who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, after angels and authorities and powers had been subjected to Him. Okay, now we've found the passage and upon reading it, it appears to be as others have told us, Jesus went to hell and preached to the spirits there. Did He really go there, why did He go there (if He indeed did go), and what does it all mean? The passage gives us a glimpse into what Jesus Christ was doing while he was dead, that is, between His crucifixion and resurrection. Two things are spoken about here: 1. The death of Christ (v. 18) 2. The triumph of Christ (vv. 18-22) First, there is the death of Christ. Verse 18 clearly tells us why Christ died and what the death of Christ does for man. It leaves us without excuse if we fail to understand why Christ died. 1. Christ died for sins. It was for the sins of man that He died. 2. Christ died vicariously. He was the just One dying for the unjust. This means that whatever Jesus Christ did could stand for and cover all men. It means that His righteousness could stand as the ideal and perfect righteousness. It means that His death could stand as the ideal and perfect death. And it means that Jesus Christ could become the ideal and perfect sin offering for man. Christ died to bring us to God. AND NOW THE QUESTION THAT IS ON EVERYONE'S MIND. Did Jesus go down to hell and preach to the spirits? This passage is found in verses 19-20. It clearly states in verse 19 that Jesus went and preached to the spirits in prison. When we read the entire passage (verses 18-22) we see the triumph of Jesus Christ. We see it in four facts that are given. 1. Jesus Christ was made alive. He was raised from the dead. Right after Jesus died in the flesh, His spirit passed into a new life, a life that could not be tempted to sin nor undergo trials and suffering. Jesus Christ was transferred into heaven, into the spiritual and perfect world or dimension where He lives, in the glory and majesty of God forever. This is where our hope of the resurrection comes from."
Romans 5:6-21,"('Grace', ""God's Love"")",Baptist," Tonight, we are going to be talking about a love you can experience. Opening question: What do you mean when you say, ""I love you""? Our central thought, or central truth for tonight is this: Even at our worst, God loves us. We may not admit it, but we've seen those talk shows. A well-known host grips a microphone three inches from the face of a disheveled Juliet. She cries as she confesses the excruciating pain caused by her boyfriend. Mr. Romeo sits one chair over with a smug grin. The audience heckles and hisses when he so much as breathes. The host proceeds with probing questions: ""So, this young man has been dating 3 other girls while also dating you? One of those girls is your older sister? One is your best friend? Even now, he refuses to cut off these competing romantic interests?"" To all these questions, the girls nods her head in ashamed agreement. The host asks what we all wonder: ""So why are you still seeing him?"" With a bowed head, she utters, ""He says he loves me."" Clearly, this pitiful girl is confused. Her view of love is distorted, and sadly, many people today share in her misunderstanding. What does love look like? Romans 5 looks at this and reviews the good news of God's undeniable love. God says that He loves you and He has proven it with action. READ Romans 5:6-8. Jesus left the beautiful realms of heaven and entered into time and space here on earth to put heaven's love on display. These verses declare that God loves every single person. So, what evidence do we have to support this wild notion that God loves us? 1. Love realized in the present. God's Holy Spirit in our lives gives internal proof for God's love. The Spirit's ongoing ministry whispers God's love in the ear day by day. ""God's love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us."" (Rom. 5:5) 2. Love rooted in the past. The love of God is more than sentiment. Objective, historical evidence of God's love presents itself in the cross of Christ. Jesus put Himself in harm's way and endured the incredible pain of the crucifixion. This clearly shows the immensity of God's love. We hear stories of soldiers who fall on grenades to secure the lives of their comrades. As we listen, our eyes well up with tears. We tune into news reports showing firemen rushing into flaming buildings and collapsing towers and we are speechless. Costly sacrifice is riveting. The Apostle Paul makes it clear that these kinds of heroic acts sometimes happen on earth, but when they do, the person usually dies for the sake of someone he or she respects. But God demonstrates His kind of love in this: Jesus died for His assassins. He died for the disrespectful. Who does something like this? Only God. On March 21, 1981, a would-be assassin fired six bullets at President Ronald Reagan. A mound of men suddenly surrounded the president the instant his life was threatened. Each man was ready to die for his leader. What is stunning about our predicament is Jesus died for us when we had nothing good to offer. We weren't exceptional leaders, but cruel rebels. Even so, He rushed to the scene and saved us. His motivation was love."
Romans 3:21-28,"('Relationship To God', 'Love  Of God')",Baptist," Tonight's session is pretty short. Does that upset anyone? What is the best gift you have ever unwrapped? In tonight's session, we are going to talk about the gift you can't give yourself. And the overall theme of the message this evening is that Jesus offers you His gift of a right relationship with God. Every social circle, business group, and committee seems to have one: that guy with the incessant need to sour the mood of the party. That lady who destroys the positive atmosphere with a dire pronouncement. The deflating neighbor who points out the one crooked board in your new deck. We all know a person who makes a beeline to the bad stuff; but if we are honest with ourselves, we have also played this role a time or two. This planet is full of depressing news, negative stories, and disappointing headlines. Things haven't gone well on earth. We can't run from this reality, but we can choose to focus on wonderful things God is doing in the mist of all this. The Lord is up to something. The Book of Romans isn't uplifting in its start. Paul began with the grim depiction of sin and God's soon to arrive wrath. But Paul didn't stop there. As we move into Romans 3, we discover that God hasn't left us in this state. Thanks be to God: relief has arrived. READ 3:21. Paul begins verse 21 with ""But now. Those two words signaled a sudden change. What happened? What happened was GRACE. The rule-keeping Pharisee could now shed his old uniform. A new game had begun. (Paul was a Pharisee) To fully grasp Paul's relief at the sight of grace, you have to know his backstory. This man, formerly known as Saul of Tarsus, was an arch enemy of the Christian church, traveling tirelessly to stomp out every last spark of the fire. Sadly, he believed this cruel campaign pleased God. Then one day, on a road to Damascus, Paul encountered the risen Lord Jesus. His eyes were opened. Paul became one of the most passionate preachers in world history Those words ""but now"" are significant. A righteousness apart from the law is now available. Have you ever waited impatiently for the release of the next book in a sizzling series? Have you stood in line for tickets? This hints at the nervous excitement we call anticipation. Paul was anticipating righteousness. READ 3: 22-26. In elementary school, you probably studied the rules of mathematics. You were called ""right"" when you got it right. You were ""wrong"" when you got it wrong. And the proper way to respond when you got your test back was to go back and correct them and make the wrongs right. And it is here that we have a problem. No human has the power to put things right again, at least by God's standards. God's way is to move beyond a repair: He provides a new birth. This new birth comes by faith, by throwing yourself solely on the grace and mercy of God. How would you best explain God's grace to someone? We are justified freely, but our deliverance didn't come cheap. Three words describe the price for freedom and you have heard them before: 1. Propitiation. The word carries the idea of appeasing God. Propitiation means a covering over of something. Because of our sin, we fully deserve to experience God's wrath and anger. Propitiation is satisfying the righteous demands of the law, and removing the wrath of God."
"Philippians 1:21, Galatians 2:20","('Selfishness', 'Living Christ')",Baptist," In Philippians 1:21, Paul said, ""For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain."" Have you ever thought about that statement? What does it mean TO LIVE IS CHRIST? What does it mean to you? Now if we look at the whole verse we can see that Paul is talking about staying here and completely God's work or to die and go and be with Jesus. To live is Christ, to me, means following as closely to Jesus' example as I can. Letting God have the control in my life. Not letting ME get in the way. Can you name a time when your ME got in the way of something God was trying to do? From time to time, we think of a plan to try to bring people together, to reach out to those who are not saved and share Christ with them. But over the years, I can vouch that not everything we have tried has worked. i.e. - We used to ring in the New Year with a watch night service. Explain. Didn't work. - We tried date night. Didn't work. - We tried the AWANA program. Didn't work for us. And on this one I want to dwell a moment. The reason AWANA didn't work for us is that ME got in the way. We had several that were willing to spend time and work with the children. But we also had at that time one or two, or more, who wanted things done THEIR way. And I can vouch that THEIR way wasn't always God's way. So, after 2 years, we phased it out and replaced it with King's Kids. We have had King's Kids for over 15 years and it is still going. I have always said that nothing we do, no program, no event, or anything is set in stone where we always have to do it that way or on the same date, or even do it at all. I used the phrase, ""Nothing is set in stone."" We can try it all, but not all of it will work. At least, not for us. So, we try something, and if it goes well, we continue. If it doesn't do well or accomplish what we were trying to accomplish in the first place, we trash it and try something else. Nothing is set in stone. But the point I am trying to make is that when it comes to God's work, we have to take the ME element out of it. As I preached before, It's not about me. It's about God. Whether it be teaching, or working with the children, or youth, music, or planning any event, we have to take the ME element out and allow God to show us and guide us. I read about a young pastor that stressed the point about removing the ME from God's work. She wrote: As I was typing up the many pages of notes I would use for my weekly podcast sermon, I needed to replace a name in part of my document with ""M-E,"" so it would read correctly as I recorded. I was trying to use the 'Find & Replace' command, but it looked a little different in the program I was using and I did something wrong, which meant I deleted every instance of M-E in the entire 17 pages of my notes. And there was no way to undo it. With a sigh, I worked a little longer on my notes, and then spent a lot of time correcting them the next day just before recording. When I finished correcting my notes, I started laughing out loud. I was teaching on Galatians 2:20, about being crucified with Christ, and my mistake had caused me to delete every instance of ME in the whole document."

Revelation 13:1-10,"('Beast Of Revelation',)",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 9/12/16 Series: Verse by Verse Through Revelation Lesson: IV.A.2: The Beast From the Sea (13:1-10) Revelation 13:1-10 (KJV) 1 And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. 2 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. 3 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast. 4 And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him? 5 And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months. 6 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. 7 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. 8 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. 9 If any man have an ear, let him hear. 10 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints. Commentary Chapter 13 presents a most important public figure of the end time--a ""beast"" coming ""out of the sea."" His ""10 horns"" and ""7 heads,"" with ""10 crowns"" on his horns depict the revived Roman Empire which was also represented by the fourth ""beast"" of Daniel, which also had ""10 horns"" (Daniel 7:7-8; 13:3; 17:3, 7). In Revelation 13 and 17 the ""beast"" is the world ruler whereas in Daniel 7 the little horn on the ""beast"" was the world ruler. Many have said that the ""beast"" refers to some character in past history, but the context clearly refers to the final three and one-half years before Christ's second coming. Under the control of this central ruler in the Middle East during the Great Tribulation will be 10 nations (Daniel 7:24, ""The 10 horns are 10 Kings""). ""And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea."" John's next vision is of a ""beast"" emerging from the ""sea."" The fact that the ""beast"" comes out from the ""sea"" indicates that he is a 'Gentile,' for the sea of humanity is involved as his source (17:15). In the ancient world ""the sea"" was seen as hostile and chaotic. The four great beasts of the book of Daniel also came from the ""sea"" (Daniel 7:1-8). In fact, many of the descriptors of Revelation's ""beast"" from the ""sea"" are similar to those associated with the four beasts in Daniel. For example, Daniel's fourth beast has 10 horns, which represent 10 kings of the Greek empire (Daniel 7:7-8, 23-24). In Revelation the diadems (crowns) on the 10 horns also represent kinship."
Matthew 22:36-39,"('Happiness', 'Relationships', 'Relationship With God', 'Relationship With Other')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Isolate Your Isolation Habits of Happiness Part 1 Matthew 22:36-39 We all want to be happy. I bet there is no single person who intentionally chooses to be unhappy. However, so many people in this world are not happy for one reason or another. In order to be happy, this is what we have to realize. Happiness is our choice. Happiness is something that we choose. In order to be happy, we must do things that will bring happiness. However, there are many who are not happy. It is partly because of the way they think, the way they talk, and the way they act does not make them happy. When people think negatively, talk critically, and act unbiblically, these are not something that they acquired overnight. They are habits that they have built. Therefore, in order to be happy, we must change the way we think, talk, and act. We must build habits of thinking, talking, and acting biblically. And we can form these habits by repeatedly doing them. Therefore, during this series, we will talk about habits that we must build to experience happiness in our lives. And today we will talk about the importance of being connected to others around us. Many people are living in emotional pain. Many people struggle with depression, anxiety, panic, addiction, and guilt. Why? Some people might say, ""They lack faith."" If they just read the Bible more, pray more, and have more faith, then their struggles will disappear. Yes, it is true that reading Bible more, praying more, and having faith more will help. However, sometimes the issue is more complicate than that. And in order to understand our struggles, we need to understand certain basic issues. The Bible says that we are created in the image of God (Gn. 1:27). In other words, we are created to be ""like"" God. And the more we become like Him, the less we will struggle with emotional problems. Therefore, the question is to figure out how to become more Godlike. One of the aspects of God that we must emulate is this. Our God is a relational being. He exists in three persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. And there is a prefect relationship between these three persons of the Trinity. Because we are living in a fallen world, we have difficulties developing and maintaining relationships. Without the ability to develop and maintain relationships, we can remain isolated. Today, we will examine three bonds that we must develop and maintain to be happy. So, what is bonding? Bonding is the ability to establish an emotional attachment to another person. It is the ability to relate to another on the deepest level. When two persons have a bond with each other, they share their deepest thoughts, dreams, and feelings with each other. And in order to be happy, we must develop and establish emotional connections in these three areas. I. We must be connected with God (vv. 36-38). Bonding is one of the most basic and foundational human need. And first relationship that we must build is our relationship with God. Verses 36-38 say this. 36 ""Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?"" 37 Jesus replied: ""'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' 38 This is the first and greatest commandment."
Matthew 24:36-44,"('Noah', 'Judgment', 'Great Commission', 'Return Of Christ')",United Methodist," As it was in the Days of Noah Matthew 24:36-44 Even in today's increasingly biblically illiterate world, the image of Noah and the Ark persists. For many it is cause for derision even as people of Noah's day mocked him for building it. Just the thought of water covering the entire surface of the dry land brings up the sneer of contempt by skeptics, both then and now. The idea of gathering all the animals as Noah was commanded seems ridiculous to them. But the Bible records that the flood did come and covered the earth. The cultured despisers of that age perished because they did not heed the message Noah gave to them from the hand of God. So to it shall be to those who scoff about the return of Jesus Christ. But Peter reports that they mocked in his day. The world has always been full of mockers. Nothing has changed. This morning's passage comes from the middle of the sermon Jesus preached from the Mount of Olives a few days before His crucifixion. Plans were well under way to be rid of Him. Jesus had already left the Temple grounds for the last time. The last act was seeing the poor widow cast in her last two mites. What a condemnation of the Temple racket of his day. The rich were pouring their gold and silver to adorn the Temple itself. This poor woman is like the widow of Zarapath in the days of Elijah who was about to cook one final loaf of bread for her and her son and then die of starvation. This fate awaited the widow as well. But God sent Elijah to save her from death, and I am sure that Jesus did likewise. But if it was up to the Temple authorities, they were happy to let her die. After all, how many destitute widows were there in the land? Upon exiting, the disciples were marveling at the beauty of that Temple. This became the occasion for a caustic response from Jesus. Not one of these glorious stones would be left upon another, a prophecy which came true before that wicked and evil generation passed from the scene. Jesus then began His sermon to the disciples who had asked Him for a sign and the times of this destruction. This led to an apocalyptic speech. It is somewhat difficult to interpret in detail because much of the detail refers to the actual destruction of Jerusalem. To the Jews, this would seem like the end of the world. But it is also apparent that there are parts of His sermon that apply to his return at the end of the world itself. How should we discern what belongs where. If one were to look at biblical prophecy in general, one often sees a double fulfillment motif. The prophecy is authenticated in the immediate future to demonstrate that the word came from God. But it also seems to function as a type of a greater fulfillment in the more distant future. If we look at the Immanuel prophecy in Isaiah 7 for example, we see a message given to King Ahaz by the Lord concerning Judah's deliverance from the kings of Syria and Israel. A young woman would conceive and have a child named Immanuel whose name means that God is with us. By the time this child was weaned, the kings of Israel and Judah would be dead and there would be a peace in the land. The skeptics today would say that this is all to the prophecy. But to the Christian, we know that it points to the future coming of Jesus who would be personally the presence of God among the people. So most of the detail applies to the fulfillment in Isaiah's day which authenticated his message as coming from God. But it points to when the Virgin Mary would conceive and bear the Son of God, our Immanuel."
"Matthew 6:30-34, Hebrews 11:1","('Worry', 'Let Me Go', 'Bend Your Back', 'Get To Work')",Assembly Of God," DO WE HAVE A TON OF STUFF WITH AN OUNCE OF FAITH? By Wade Martin Hughes, Sr. Kyfingers@aol.com Text: Matthew 6:33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. Hebrews 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. I GUESS I AM STUCK HERE? THIS TRAP HAS DOOMED BY FAMILY SEVERAL GENERATIONS? Once when I was a pastor at a small mountain mission church a young man finished his education and was idle and drew several government programs. His rent and utilities were paid. He drew so many food stamps that he traded half of them for cash money. He watched TV all night and slept all day. There was talk in this poor area of Kentucky that able bodied people would be losing their benefits. This strong, young man came to the altar one Sunday night and he was broken and crying. He tarried at the altar, so I went over and was praying with him. He explained to me: PASTOR, I HAVE TO FIND A GOOD JOB AND I HAVE TO FIND IT SOON as he had a wife and children. So we called the church around the young family and prayed for THE LORD TO HELP HIM FIND A GOOD JOB WITH GOOD PAY. The Spirit of God really moved as the church prayed. I JUST KNEW HE WAS GOING TO FIND A JOB THE NEXT DAY. I picked them up for church on the next Sunday night. I was so excited, I knew that week he had a job. I asked him? He said: NO, I DID NOT FIND A JOB!!! I WAITED BY MY PHONE every day this week and NO ONE CALLED? I asked him, WHERE DID YOU APPLY? How many businesses did you visit? How many applications did you fill out? The answer was --0--... He watched TV all night and slept all day but HE KEPT THE PHONE RIGHT NEXT TO HIM and he said he knew he would have heard it if it had rang. He said: I GUESS THE LORD LET ME DOWN???? He never did get a job??? HOW SAD? HE ENDED UP IN PRISON. They feed him and his family continued drawing a check? YOU HAVE TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND AND BREAK THE THINKING PATTERNS... ARE WE REALLY LOOKING FOR THE OPPORTUNITY --- YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO STOOP PRETTY LOW... TO GET UP... Ruth 1:16 And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God: 17 Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me. 18 When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her. RUTH'S LESSON IS VERY PRACTICAL --- YOU FIND THE WILL OF GOD IN GOING AND DOING WHAT YOU CAN, WHERE YOU CAN, WHEN YOU CAN... As Ruth was in a strange place... Ruth never knew the habits or customs of this strange land. Ruth BLINDLY FOLLOWS NAOMI... RUTH HAD A MADE UP MIND... WE MUST QUIT BURNING THE ROADS UP DOING NOTHING --- WE MUST ARISE ABOVE THE LOTTERY MENTALITY--- LOOK FOR THE OPPORTUNITY--- SEIZE THE MOMENT--- Ruth 2:2 And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears"

Luke 6:1-11,"('Sabbath', 'Heal The Sick', 'Sabbath Rest')",Lutheran," Introduction I had a relative who loved to knit. On a couple of occasions--Christmas or my birthday--I received one of her sweater creations. She was so proud of what she had made and I was certainly aware of all the work and care she had put into the gift. The problem was the sweaters weren't a style that I would wear and they didn't fit. The result was that I would only wear the sweaters when I knew she would be present. A gift that is not used correctly or is not used at all is a sad thing. This goes for sweaters and for Sabbaths. The gift of Sabbath The Sabbath is literally a day of rest. The writer of Genesis recorded that after God had finished creation, in six days, God rested. The New Revised Standard Version Chapter 2 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all their multitude. 2 And on the seventh day God finished the work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all the work that he had done. 3 So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all the work that he had done in creation. God wanted the People of God, the Israelites to follow suit. When God gave Moses the Ten Commandments, keeping the Sabbath holy was one of them. The New Revised Standard Version The Ten Commandments Remember the Sabbath day, and keep it holy. 9 Six days you shall labor and do all your work. 10 But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God; you shall not do any work The Sabbath became part of Judaism's identity. Mixed among gentile heathen and suffering under an oppressive foreign government Judaism adopted three identifying characteristics: "" The mark of circumcision "" Kosher meals "" The Sabbath The Sabbath became a hot topic in the early Christian Church. Most of the early Christians were Gentiles and not Jews. They did not have a history of keeping the Sabbath. Life and the Sabbath The Pharisees were sincere, religious people who were concerned with keeping their Jewish identity. They created an elaborate set of rules in order to help people keep the Sabbath and express their Jewishness. Jesus confronted the Pharisees. Hi confrontation threatened the identity of the Jews that the Pharisees had worked so hard to protect. Jesus proclaims that he is Lord of the Sabbath. Jesus is the fulfillment of the law. Because of this the followers of Jesus follow the guidance of Jesus and the Holy Spirit rather than a set of rules. The New Revised Standard Version The Question about the Sabbath The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath."" The Sabbath was God's gift to humankind to promote life. (The Sabbath was not given so that God would receive more worship.) Jesus stresses this in his words and actions. The New Revised Standard Version The Man with a Withered Hand I ask you, is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath, to save life or to destroy it?"" The Sabbath Today We are a people who have been richly blessed by the Lord. "" We walk in a relationship with God. "" Our lives have meaning and purpose because we know that God has called us to love and serve."
"Matthew 5:1-12, Matthew 5:1-12","('Beattitudes',)",Episcopal," This sermon was delivered at Holy Trinity, Ayr, Ayrshire, Scotland on Sunday the 29th January 2017; Holy Trinity is a Scottish Episcopal Church in the Dioceses of Glasgow and Dumfries. The readings for today are: Micah 6:1-8 1 Corinthians 1:18-31 Psalm 15 Matthew 5:1-12 Please join me in a short prayer from Psalms 19:14, ""Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of our hearts, be acceptable in your sight, O Lord, my strength, and my redeemer. Amen. Introduction. The phrase, ""Man's inhumanity to man"" is known to us all, but it was only recently that I found out that it was first documented in a poem by Robert Burns called, ""Man was made to mourn"". It was a Dirge of course, written in 1784, but it was possible that Burns reworded this from a similar quote from Samuel von Pufendorf who wrote, ""More inhumanity has been done by man himself than any other of nature's causes."" And we all know this to be true, ... look at the Holocaust alone, absolutely horrible, ... the atrocities were beyond comprehension and so I would hate to think that man (or woman), has all the answers, even though some claim to have, ... however, that is why I find it refreshing to hear 1st Corinthians 1:18 this morning which read, ""For the preaching of the cross, to them that perish, is foolishness; but unto us which are saved, it is the power of God"". I love that verse and I will tell you why, ... it tells us that we are on a journey, ... a special journey with the one and only God. ... And this is very different to the words of any other religion such as Buddhism, Sikhism, Muslimism, Hinduism, Shintoism, Paganism and any other ism's you can think of, ... including Judaism and own our Old Testament'ism which are all very similar in what they set out to do. ... And that is to get their God, ... (who ever he is), ... to acknowledge and bless them, and even look after them when they die. ... How? ... By ... their own good works and charitable deeds. Yes they are all very similar, they all say that you must do good things, for their God to bless them. But Christianity is completely different, ... no other religion comes close to our New Testament, because no other religion had a saviour who lived on this earth as we do, ... and died in our place as the sinners we are, ... he died instead of us, but by doing so, he has changed our very outlook on life from all these other religions. And this is summed up in Philippians 3, verses 8, 9 & 10, and I paraphrase, ""I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered, ... and do count them but dung, (dung, you heard right), that I may win Christ, ... and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, ... but that which is through the faith of Christ, ... that I may know him, ... and the power of his resurrection"". Those verses tell us is that all our good works, ... all our charitable deeds are counted worthless before the Lord, ... that is, ... if they are done to impress him, ... by following the Law, rather than grace."
Psalms 19:7-9,"('Bible', 'Word Of God', 'Equipping Disciples', 'Transforming Power')",Christian/Church Of Christ," 1. We are seeking authenticity - last week we considered the danger of hypocrisy. How are we to be real? 2. A Bible Like Mom's In her book Parenting with Scripture, Kara Durbin wrote, ""When I was little, I wanted a Bible just like my mom's, and I was thrilled when I received one as a present. As I grew up, I underlined verses as I memorized them and marked ones that spoke to me about a particular topic. I loved being able to flip through, finding familiar passages with my notations in that big book. It made God's Word feel like home to me."" Kara went on to say that when she got to college her Bible was falling apart and had to be replaced. She painstakingly transferred every underlining and notation to her new Bible, and that's the Bible she still uses. Our children need to see us maintaining our own personal relationship with Christ. They can spot hypocrisy faster than anyone. But if we truly love the Lord and His Word, they will notice. Our greatest legacy is the living faith that makes others want a Bible like ours, because a Bible that's falling apart usually belongs to someone who isn't. Instill in your child a habit of turning to the Scripture to answer questions...it will serve as the guidebook for life. Kara Durbin "" In American homes the Bible has taken on the status of an icon with little practical value. When asked, ""What book has most influenced your life?"" in a recent Library of Congress survey, respondents awarded the Bible the top position. But only 34 percent of American Christians read God's Word on their own during the week, and of that group, only 13 percent claim to read it daily. "" ""Americans revere the Bible,"" says pollster George Gallup, Jr., ""but, by and large, they don't read it."" "" Statistics say that 92 percent of all Americans have at least three Bibles in their homes. Perhaps like the South Dakota rancher, yours is secreted away in a closet. And like him, you don't suspect that there's a fortune hidden within its pages. Signs of the Times (October 2002) 3.

Exodus 3:1-14,"('Covenant', 'Tetragrammaton')",Assembly Of God," THE GOD OF THE BUSH Ex. 3:1-14 INTRODUCTION A. HUMOR 1. President Bush was going through an airport when he saw a man who looked like Moses. He asked him, ""Are you Moses?"" The man acted as if he didn't hear. 2. He asked him again, ""Are you Moses?"" The man refused to look at him. The third time, Bush got right up close and asked, ""Are you Moses?"" ""Yes!"" 3. ""Why didn't you answer me the first two times I spoke to you?"" ""Because the last time I spoke to a bush, I spent the next 40 years on the backside of the wilderness."" B. WHAT'S IN A NAME? 1. Pharaoh once asked a good question, ""Who is the Lord, that I should serve Him?"" Who and what is God? 2. A great definition is the Westminster Catechism: ""God is a Spirit, infinite, eternal and unchangeable in His being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth."" 3. God reveals Himself by making known or proclaiming His Name. To worship God is to call upon His Name (Gen. 12:8), to fear it (Deut. 28:58), to praise it (2 Sam. 22:50), to glorify it (Ps. 86:9). It's wickedness to take His name in vain (Ex. 20:7) or to blaspheme it (Lev. 18:21; 24:16). C. MOST COMMON NAMES OF SCRIPTURE: 1. ELOHIM (trans. ""God"" in KJV) is the word that signifies the creative power and omnipotence of God. The plural form foreshadows the revelation of the Trinity. 2. EL SHADDAI. El Shaddai is the name God used with Abraham. Shaddu means ""mountain"" and used in conjunction with El is means ""Almighty God."" It can also mean ""the God who is sufficient (Gen. 21:33). 3. ADONAI literally means ""Lord, Master."" It conveys the idea of rulership and dominion (Ex. 23:17; Isa. 10:16,33. 4. MELEK is the word speaking of God as ""King."" Nebuchadnezzar said, ""I praise...the King of Heaven"" Dan. 4:37. David recognized God as King; ""The Lord is King forever & ever"" Ps. 10:16; ""He is the King of Glory"" Ps. 24:8,10; ""I will exalt You my God the King!"" Ps. 145:1. 5. But tonight I want us to look at God's special name revealed in connection with His bringing Israel (& us) into covenant with Him. D. TEXT 1 Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. 2 There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up. 3 So Moses thought, ""I will go over and see this strange sight--why the bush does not burn up."" 4 When the LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, ""Moses! Moses!"" And Moses said, ""Here I am."" 5 ""Do not come any closer,"" God said. ""Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground."" 6 Then he said, ""I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob."" At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God....""I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt."" Moses said to God, ""Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' Then what shall I tell them?"" God said to Moses, ""I am who I am. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: 'I am has sent me to you.'"" Ex. 3:1-7,10,13-14."
"1 Peter 1:2, Romans 5:1-11","('Discipleship', 'Chosen By God', 'Changed', 'Cleansed')",Pentecostal," As you know our preaching theme is Discovering your Destiny, and this morning we are going to consider how we have been chosen, changed and cleansed by God. To focus our thoughts I want us to start with a single verse from a letter written by the Apostle Peter to the followers of Christ who were living in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. For those of us who are not great on Biblical Geography, it's roughly the area we know today as Turkey. Peter was writing to Christians who had been scattered far from home, some because of persecution, some because of circumstance. Peter was writing to encourage people who were lonely, afraid and discouraged. These words that Peter wrote so long ago are an encouragement to us today. Listen to these words from 1 Peter 1 verse 2: ""God the Father knew you and chose you long ago, and His Spirit has made you holy. As a result, you have obeyed Him and have been cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ. May God give you more and more grace and peace."" There are three things I want to draw to your attention this morning: 1. God the Father CHOSE you. 2. God the Holy Spirit CHANGES you. 3. God the Son CLEANSES you. Ephesians 1:4 tells us, ""Even before He made the world, God loved us and chose us in Christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes."" That is an amazing verse. We have been chosen, you have been chosen, I have been chosen. Chosen because of God's love for us. Even before He made the world, God loved us and chose us in Christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes. God has chosen us. We are special to Him, we belong to His family, we are children of the living God. God the Father knew you and chose you long ago - the greek word used here is eklektos (ek-lek-tos') , which means set apart, chosen before, elect, selected. God is eternal, He knows the end from the beginning and everything in-between, He knew you from the start of time as we understand time, and He loved you and chose you to be His. God chose those whom He knew would believe and trust in Him. God has given us freewill, yet He knew who would willingly repent and turn to Him. In all things, especially in salvation, God is sovereign. He knew who would believe, He knew who would know their need of a Saviour, He knew who would have faith in the Messiah that He would send, He knew who would turn to Jesus as their personal Lord and Saviour, God the Father knew everything and everyone even before He spoke the universe into existence. You and I, and all who have faith in the one true God are loved and chosen to be the people of God. 2 Timothy 2:19 reminds us, ""God's truth stands firm like a foundation stone with this inscription: ""The Lord knows those who are His,"" and ""All who belong to the Lord must turn away from evil."" If you are a Christian this morning, if you have repented of your sin and trusted in Jesus as your Lord and Saviour then you have been loved and chosen by God. We are saved by God's love and mercy, we are set free from the penalty for our sin and assured of a place in Heaven, all because of God's love for us."
Daniel 5:1-31,"('Tithing', 'Seeking God', 'Found Wanting')",Holiness," ""Weighed in the Balance"" February 5, 2017 Daniel 5:1-31 Have you ever been at a party and someone did or said something that changed the entire thing for everyone? Way back when - I might have been the one to say something crude or inappropriate and spoiled it for everyone. I never did anything like this king, tho. King Belshazzar was living it up. His Father had died who had been a great king and so he has taken over and is enjoying his popularity, position and power. Of course he is drinking. That always contributes to unwise decisions and choices. I don't know what he was thinking - I suspect the enemy of our souls whispered in his ear to do something really ungodly. He does that, you know. That is one reason I am so opposed to alcohol and drugs. It lowers our resistance and makes us susceptible to doing things we normally wouldn't do. That's one reason I won't take even one drink. It opens the door to things I certainly don't want opened. Anyway, for whatever reason, King Belshazzar ordered the servants to bring out the holy temple artifacts they had stolen from Israel. I don't know why. Perhaps because they were made of gold. Maybe it was because they were beautiful. It may have even been to mock God by using His sacred things to worship other gods. Whatever the reason - it was a deadly mistake. It ended up costing him his life. Can you imagine his shock when a human hand appeared out of thin air and began to write on the wall? The Bible says, ""His face turned pale and he was so frightened that his legs became weak and his knees were knocking."" He was pretty scared - and he didn't even know what the writing said yet. So he called in all his wise and educated men to read the writing on the wall. No one could understand it. Spiritual things need spiritual insight to understand them. So Daniel come into the picture and solves the puzzle. Belshazzar was killed that very night but not until he made Daniel the third highest ruler in his kingdom. This story has so much we can learn from it - and as you study it God will give you much insight into it. This morning, though, I want to take one thought from this story and expound on it a little. It is that little phrase on the all. The middle word - Tekel. It means ""You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting."" I hope none of us ever hear those words said about us. But one thing it reminds us of is that there is going to be an accounting for each one of us. The words we say; the things we do; the things we don't do - it will all be weighed on the scales of God's Justice. God reminds us of that over and over. Listen. ""Surely the day is coming; it will burn like a furnace. All the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble, and the day that is coming will set them on fire,"" says the Lord Almighty. ""Not a root or a branch will be left to them. But for you who revere my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its rays. And you will go out and frolic like well-fed calves."" Malachi 4:1-2 ""But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the Day of Judgment for every empty word they have spoken.

Matthew 5:21-48,"('Reconciliation', 'Respect', 'Sanctity Of Life', 'Sermon On The Mount')",*other,atthew 5:21-48; Psalm 119:1-8; Dt. 30:15-," Title: Mountain Living or Here Comes the Kingdom! A life in which we can 1. Have a high regard for Others 2. Possess a Respect for the Sanctity of Life and 3. Meet our Differences through the Practice of Agape Love INTRO: Grace and peace from God our Father and from His Son Jesus Christ who came to take away the sin of the world! According to USA Today, the city of Naperville, Illinois is one of the greatest places to call home in the United States of America. Now, why would they say that? Well, their reasons are quite simple: Naperville is: a. One of the wealthiest cities in the United States with an Median Family Income of a little over 127, 500.00. b. 98% of its citizens 25 years and old have a high school diploma c. It has one of the lowest crime and poverty rates in the United States d. It is the home of North Central College along with being a satellite location for seven more colleges e. Over 63% of its citizens have at least a bachelor's degree f. Naperville's library has consistently been one of top public libraries in the United States for over 20 years So, let's all go home and pack and move to Naperville, Illinois or let us this morning look at Matthew 5:21-48 where Jesus tells us that wherever we can live can be a place even better than Naperville, Illinois. History tells us that back in 1620 there was a collection of 102 passengers that set sail from Plymouth Rock, England who believed that with God's help they could build a society much like the one we read about in the book of Genesis. They believed that God would help them create a Garden of Eden like society. A society based on the Lord, His Word and the power and presence of His Holy Spirit. They not only believed that it was possible they believed they had been given a mandate to make it possible. I believe this morning that they must have read and had passages like Matthew 5:21-48 memorized. For as we read this passage and see it in Jesus' overall plan for the Kingdom of Heaven we come to realize that Jesus was teaching and directing his disciples and others to create a place where the life of higher righteousness could be realized. Jesus was telling his disciples that such a world could exist through Him. As you read Jesus' words here at first you may be tempted to think that such a society in which Jesus is describing is an impossibility. You may even believe that it is impossible to even conceive of such a world and certainly it is impossible for such a society to exist here on our earth. However, the more you allow Jesus' words and His Spirit to sink in and renew your heart, your mind and your soul then you come to the conclusion that it is such a society that Jesus died for and sent His Holy Spirit. It is such a society that we as His faithful followers are to co-partner with Him to build here on earth. In this passage our Lord deals with some heavy issues. Issues that include anger, murder, lust, adultery, swearing, retaliation and the creation of an enemies list. These are things that dominate our news headlines each and every day. All we have to do is open a newspaper, begin to read some stories on line and we will be bombarded with news about each one of these things. In fact, about 80 - 90% of all of our modern day movies and TV shows have one of these as their plot line. If they were suddenly removed from society then modern day movies and TV would for the most part be non-existent."
Genesis 23:1-20,"('Death', 'Abraham', 'Sarah', 'Pilgrimage', 'Abraham And Sarah')",United Methodist," When I Can Read My Title Clear Genesis 23:1-20 Today we come to the end of a remarkable journey of faith and the first step into a new journey. Sarah had accompanied her husband Abraham on this journey. We don't know how long Abraham and Sarah were married, but from the time we are introduced to them, the journey lasted sixty-two years from that point. As half-brother and sister, she had known Abraham all her life. When their father Nahor removed from the advanced civilization of their day to a relatively insignificant city of Harran, Sarah went with her father as did Abraham. We don't know directly why Nahor did this, but we can clearly discern it was the hand of the Lord. In fact, Abraham is recorded as having been called out from Ur, yet the first we hear the Lord speak to him, he was in Harran. We also know from the book of Joshua that Abraham and his father had at one time worshiped other gods in Ur before the Lord called him. Sarah was involved in all this, although we don't have any mention of her religious convictions before she and Abraham went out to the land that God had promised them. In the biblical sense, they were an Adam and Eve couple without children and had title by God to the land of Canaan without the right to occupy. It is indeed a strange story. Sarah and Abraham would spend their lives in tents, as nomads at the edge of the desert. Like Moses, they could see the Promised Land far off. It was to belong to their children but was not theirs to enter. The last we hear of Abraham was that he returned from Mt. Moriah to Beersheba which was at the very edge of the desert, to the land of Abimelech to remain there. But in this passage it says that Sarah died in Hebron which is in the Promised Land proper. It seems quite an act of grace on God's part to let her take her last breath there. Abraham and Isaac were heartbroken over the death of Sarah who is the only woman whose age at death is recorded. As was the custom, the body needed to be buried as soon as possible. If Abraham and Sarah were visiting or passing through Hebron for some reason at the time of her death, it would be necessary to bury her around Hebron as it was quite a distance to Beersheba. So Abraham asked the local tribal chiefs for permission to bury her there. He had already spied a cave which would suit the purpose at the end of the field belonging to Ephron the Hittite. Like Abraham, this man was a stranger in the land as was ruled by the sons of Heth. So rather than dealing directly with Ephron, Abraham went to the tribal chefs to intercede in his behalf. Abraham said he wished to purchase the cave at its full price. The sons of Heth pretty much told Abraham to take it. But the land did not properly belong to them as it belonged to Ephron. There is also a sense of Middle East bartering going on here. It was polite to offer it as a gift, but both partied expected payment. Abraham weighed out the 100 shekels of silver in the presence of witnesses. He now had a place where he could bury Sarah. She would be buried in the Promised Land. Abraham took title to the cave and buried his wife there."
Song of Songs 8:4-14,"('Rapture', 'Bride Of Christ')",Christian Missionary Alliance," Solomon gives to us some very wonderful and unique ideas concerning the bride of Christ. It is possible Solomon did not understand the full extent of what he is saying about the bride of Christ. In poetry, however, there are many levels of understanding. The Song of Solomon is not the kind of book you can look at expositionally or even verse by verse. Hebrew verse is quite hard for us today to really grasp. Although Solomon was writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, he did not understand the full extent of what he was writing about. Many of the Old Testament writers in particular were in this category. Coming to the end of this book it is profitable to look back and just see where Solomon is going with all of this. I am quite sure Solomon had no comprehension of what the ""rapture"" is, as we understand it today. The love affair of the ""Groom"" with the ""Bride"" is a wonderful similarity to Christ and the Christian. If we can only can understand and grasp the full meaning here we would begin to appreciate our relationship to Christ in a different way. To come to the subject of the rapture is a very important subject. I want to look at it not as some doctrine, but I want to look at it as it reflects the Groom and the Bride. Many maintain misconceptions concerning the church, particularly in regard to prophecy and the second coming of Christ. A key verse is 8:4, ""I tell you, O daughters of Jerusalem. You must not wake up my love, until it is pleasing to her."" This is similar to what Jesus taught. Matthew 24:36 - ""But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only."" Acts 1:7 - ""And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power."" Most Christians do not have proper understanding of what the rapture is all about. Listen to how the apostle Paul explains it. 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18 - ""16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words."" The rapture is Christ gathering together his bride to bring home. The ""rapture"" as we understand it, is simply a means by which Christ can gather together his bride, both those who were dead and those who were alive, and bring them into his heaven to spend eternity with him. In order to understand this ""rapture,"" I need to break it down into several different categories. I. Experiencing God's Grace in the Wilderness. When Moses brought Israel out of Egypt and into the wilderness, there were several levels. The first level was separating Israel from the Egyptians. This was in the seven plagues of Egypt, which did not touch those of Israel who had separated themselves unto Jehovah. The second level was crossing the Red Sea."
1 Corinthians 2:1-16,"('Mind Of Christ', ""Holy Spirit's Power"")",United Methodist," ""The Mind of Christ"" 1 Corinthians 2:1-16 Our little--almost 2-year-old Owen--hasn't been sleeping well for the past couple of months. This, of course, means that his parents haven't been sleeping well either. We don't understand why Owen wakes up several times a night crying, wanting to be held and will not fall back to sleep without one of us in his room. He can't tell us. He doesn't have the vocabulary and we can't read his mind. It must be very frustrating for him, not being able to communicate with us exactly what he is going through or feeling. And the same goes for a lot of us, I would imagine. We all have things about ourselves that are hard to explain. Each of us have feelings that are so personal, things which are so private, experiences that are so intimate that no one else knows them except our own individual spirit. And in our Scripture lesson for this morning, Paul tells us that the same is true of God. There are deep and intimate things in God which only His Spirit knows; and that Spirit is the only One Who can lead us into an intimate knowledge of God. A long time ago there was a guy who, more than anything wanted to get to know God and know that God loved him, accepted him and had saved him. And so he read his Bible. He studied it hard. He got to know all the ""Thou shall nots..."" and the ""Thou shalls...""--the whole shabang!!! He even went off to a really good seminary--one of the best--where he studied about God and the rules of the Church. And then, he himself became a priest. And he found a group of like-minded folks, who wanted to please God. They got together and formed what would soon be called ""The Holiness Club."" And ""The Holiness Club"" worked really hard trying to following all the rules in the Bible correctly. They figured that if they just tried hard enough they could be perfect and acceptable to God. But this was a frustrating thing to try and do, because try as they might, they were just human beings with temptations, flaws, sinful inclinations and so forth just like everyone else in the world. They did a lot of things. And their intentions were good. But ultimately they were left feeling defeated and alienated from the God they were trying to emulate. Eventually, the young priest who had set out to make himself the perfect Christian decided to give up. He realized that he couldn't achieve his goal. And oh, was he depressed. And oh, did he feel like a failure. He had really hit rock bottom. He felt that he would never, ever be able to measure up to the high standards of God as written out in so many pages of the Bible. One night a friend of his invited him to go to a special Bible study. And he didn't want to go. He'd been to enough Bible studies to last a lifetime, thank you very much, and see where they had gotten him? But his friend was persistent. So, reluctantly, he went. And this Bible study, well, it wasn't an incredibly academic affair."
1 John 3:10-12,"('Love', 'Family')",Pentecostal," LOVE IN THE FAMILY Study Text: 1 John 3: 10 - 12 Introduction: - Families generally begin in love. A man and woman fall in love, they get married, and out of their love come children. . In the beginning, God established the family as the first of all human relationships. - From that family, God built society. The family is still the foundational unit of society. In fact, no church, no community, or no nation is any stronger than the families that make it up. - The problem is how to keep this love alive and growing, for love requires constant attention. Unless it is nourished by constant care, like a plant without water it will shrivel and die. - Each of us should re-double our efforts to ensure that our families are all that they should be. Husbands and wives have a God-given obligation to love one another and to submit to one another for the glory of God. Parents have a God-given obligation to create a home that allows their children to become all they have been designed by the Lord to be. - We shall discuss the topic under three subheadings: 1. The Expectation of Love in the Family 2. The Expedition of Love in the Family 3. The Evaluation of Love in the Family - Since the family is to live together in unity and oneness for the good of all, love must be present at all times. Where there is no love, there can be a family, and if there is, it cannot be a successful, progressing and profiting family. - The most important thing we can do to nourish the love in our families is to live the first great commandment: ""Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind"" (Matthew 22:37). - Our Heavenly Father is the source of all truth and all love. By loving him we draw close to him and become more like him. As that happens, we receive from him the knowledge and power to love each family member, to better nurture their love, and to meet the daily challenges in our homes. - The Saviour taught, ""He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love"" (1 John 4:8). If we love God, he gradually teaches us and gives us the power to love as he loves. - The Saviour defined the second great commandment as ""Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself"" (Matthew 22:39). Our closest neighbours are the members of our own families. And yet we sometimes fail to treat them with the same courtesy and kindness that we grant to strangers. - The family has been under attack ever since Satan first taunted Adam and Eve. So today, each must guard against the hazard of contention in the family, and pursue love according to the purpose of God. - The home is the foundation of learning and love. Here, parents help children overcome the natural tendencies to be selfish that is rooted in every one, and to put on love which is patterned after Christ. - Showing love for our own parents is also important to nourishing love in our families. We cannot expect our children to love and respect us if we do not show them that we love and respect our own parents. Loving our parents is necessary not only in nurturing family love and unity, but in loving God."
Matthew 5:13-20,"('Pharisees', 'Chirstians Can')",United Methodist," Matthew 5:13-20 How can we exceed? 1. What did a Pharisee look like? When it comes to righteousness, the Pharisees are tough to beat and we are to exceed them, do better, be better. "" The Pharisees of Jesus s day appeared to be the elite-ed-ness of what it is to be righteous, Godly, saintly, pious "" People believed them to be passionate about the law of God "" Keepers of the fire in the synagogues "" Paid attention to the purity of rules and regulations "" Strong advocates of the Resurrection and a deepened hunger for heavenly rewards and Heaven its self they are the religious superstars of the day "" Jesus says, ""I tell you,"" says Jesus, ""unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven"" (v. 20). "" Jesus says that our righteousness has to exceed that of the Pharisees. Not just match it, but surpass it. How are we supposed to respond to this? 2. The great Apostle was a Pharisee, Unless our Goodness exceeds that of the Pharisees "" Remember what the apostle Paul said about his own accomplishments as a Pharisee? ""If anyone else has reason to be confident in the flesh, I have more,"" he wrote to the Philippians. ""Circumcised on the eighth day, a member of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee"" (Philippians 3:4-5). Paul was a top-performing Pharisee. ""unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven"" (v. 20). "" Unless our godliness, saintly ness, piteous ness exceeds that of Pharisee "" Unless our passion for the law of God exceeds that of a Pharisee "" Unless our strictly- ness for regulations exceed that of a Pharisee "" Jesus has a new approach to righteousness that is not based on rigorous law-keeping. Instead, he wants his followers to be salt of the earth and light of the world, fulfilling the law in new ways -- as he does. 3. What exceeds the Pharisees? According to the text "" People that look like salt. Or that does what salt does Jesus says that they are ""the salt of the earth"" (v. 13). In the ancient world, salt was a valuable commodity used for sacrifice, purification, seasoning and preservation. Christians are to play all of these roles in the world, and are to remain salty by staying true to their mission and avoiding contamination. ""If salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored?"" asks Jesus. It cannot, of course. Contaminated salt ""is no longer good for anything, but is thrown out and trampled underfoot"" "" Remember Salt is valuable, a salty Christian is valuable "" Remember salt is used for sacrifice we are used in our times we sacrifice our time for God "" Remember salt is used for purification sure enough Jesus want us pure "" Remember salt is used for preserving and seasoning as people attempting to exceed the righteous of the Pharisee we are preserving lasting we are the seasoned we have been in the valleys we have been on the mountain top."
Revelation 13:11-18,"('Lamb', 'Beasts Of Revelation', 'Horns', 'Beast-Worship')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 10/19/16 Title: Beast from the Land (13:11-18) Revelation 13:11-18 (KJV) 11 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. 12 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. 13 And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, 14 And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. 15 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. 16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. 18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six. Introduction The first beast is a political power and a person, and his power will become worldwide. We come now to the second beast, the one who comes out of the earth and is a religious leader. Commentary Chapter 13 has two parts; the first part of the chapter (1-10) deals with the coming of Satan's false prince; the remainder of the chapter (11-18) has to do with a second mysterious person conjured up by Satan to act as the propaganda chief for the beast. This person is called the false prophet. The first beast is possibly a Gentile, or at least he is partly Gentile, since he comes up from the sea. The second beast, the lamb like beast, is probably a Jew, since he comes up out of the earth, or, more accurately, out of ""the land,"" meaning the ancient land of Palestine where Christ was born and died. What is the difference between them? The sea represents the peoples of the world. The great mob of mankind today is like the surging and restless sea--that has always been true. The earth from which this second beast arises is symbolic of Palestine, and it is naturally assumed that the second beast comes from Israel. He is a messiah, and Israel would not accept him unless he had come from their land and was one of them. Note: some believe that this second beast will be a nation or a government. But that theory is difficult to accept because the Greek says ""another beast."" The way it is constructed denotes another of the same kind therefore, the most natural way to read this is that another man[1] is on the scene performing critical works at the direction of the first beast. The great function of the second beast is to glorify the first beast. Thus Satan, the beast, and the false prophet form a satanic Trinity."
Romans 5:8,"('Forgiveness', 'Usefulness', 'Forgiven')",Baptist," Sanctuary Dedication Service, Southwest Baptist. 1/29/17 Last week I spent just about every waking minute trying to get this pulpit ready for today. Amazingly, Brother T. C. Garret built this from scratch in a little over one week. Elaborate with details. I picked it up Friday a week ago and was just able to get it finished by about 6:00PM yesterday. As I worked on finishing this pulpit, I found a few flaws. And as I finished it, I created a few flaws. No doubt the flaws were probably because of the haste with which it was built and the near panic finishing that I performed. As I sanded and puttied and sanded some more, God began to speak to me. I began to think about all of the work we have had done leading up to this service today, and in all of the work there have been flaws, some minor and some pretty drastic. We worked with our builder to fix the big ones, but no job is perfect and I am sure if you look hard enough, you will still find a few flaws. The word that God was speaking to me is that, just as the building work or this pulpit are flawed, we too are flawed. As Christians, we strive to be Christ like in our daily lives. But as long as we are in the flesh, no matter how hard we try, there will still be flaws. Some are obvious, such as a hot temper or a critical spirit. Others, however, are more difficult to spot, such as envy or conceit or jealousy or a spirit of lust. Just as I have covered many of the flaws in this pulpit, we can be pretty good at covering our own flaws. We may think that no one knows our flaws; however, nothing is hidden from God. He sees all of the areas of our lives that are less than perfect, and yet he loves us still. ""While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us"" Then God gave me another revelation. Even with its flaws, this pulpit will still serve its purpose. The word of God will still be preached from it and it will stand up to some pounding from time to time. This Sanctuary and building that we dedicate today, with all of its flaws will still serve its purpose. It is a house of God where the members of this Body of Christ will gather together to worship in spirit and in truth. God willing, this facility will be a lighthouse to this community, even with all of its imperfections. Then God gave me on final revelation. Even though we are flawed, even though we are weak, even though we are prone to make mistakes, if we are surrendered to God, we will still serve our purpose for His glory. That begs the question, what is our purpose? First and foremost, we are to love God with all our heart, mind, soul, and strength. When we do this, we begin to conform our lives to the image of Christ. My prayer will be ""let your will be done in my life, as it is in Heaven."" My daily life will include time with my Lord. I will set aside time to read and enjoy His Word. I will worship Him with my conduct, my thought life, and my speech. Second, I will love my neighbor as myself. If I love God with all my heart, mind, soul, and strength, then I will have a heart for the lost, just as Jesus did."
2 Chronicles 7:14,"('Revival', 'Christian Living')",Baptist," OPENING STORY: Wife goes with husband to doctor. Doctor examines the husband and diagnose that the husband is critically ill has but perhaps there might be a slim chance of a cure otherwise he has only one week to live. The doctor takes the man's wife into the next room and reports his finding to her privately. ""His only hope to be cured is for you to relieve all his stresses. You can extend his time by rubbing feet and back, cooking his favorite meals, relieve him of all stress by letting him go fishing, waiting on him hand and foot, etc. Be as affectionate as when you were first married. The wife returns to her husband and he asks, ""Honey, what did doctor say?"" She replies, ""You're going to die."" You see many people do not get healed, not because their condition is incurable, but they're not healed because they do not want to follow the doctor's orders. More than that, the wife is like the church and her husband is like our community and our nation We know what we need to do, we are just too lazy to do it. Background The first few chapters of 2 Chronicles record the building of the Temple of God, under King Solomon. "" The Temple was completed and Solomon dedicated it to the Lord, in chapter 6. "" He knelt down before God's people, spread his hands out toward heaven, and said a long prayer - a prayer for the nation, asking God for His blessings The passage we read was God's response to his prayer. Solomon's prayer is a long prayer - in 2 Chron 6:14-39. will look at verses 24-30 to understand the context. Both Solomon's prayer and God's answer is full of conditional statements IF - THEN a mathematical equation If A then B 2 Chronicles 6:24-25 24 ""Or IF Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and return and confess Your name, and pray and make supplication before You in this temple, 25 THEN hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring them back to the land which You gave to them and their fathers. 2 Chronicles 6:26-27 26 ""WHEN the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against You, WHEN they pray toward this place and confess Your name, and turn from their sin because You afflict them, 27 THEN hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel, that You may teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on Your land which You have given to Your people as an inheritance. 2 Chronicles 6:28-29 28 ""WHEN there is famine in the land, pestilence or blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers; WHEN their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatever plague or whatever sickness there is; 29 whatever prayer, whatever supplication is made by anyone, or by all Your people Israel, WHEN each one knows his own burden and his own grief, and spreads out his hands to this temple: 2 Chronicles 6:30 30 THEN hear from heaven Your dwelling place, and forgive, and give to everyone according to all his ways, whose heart You know (for You alone know the hearts of the sons of men),"
Psalms 23:1-3,"('Restoration', 'Spiritual Renewal', ""God's Restoration"")",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Soul Restoration Introduction: I enjoy restoring things, whether its old vending machines, pop machines, old gas pumps, etc. There is something rewarding about bringing these old things back to life. It may be the nostalgia of an era long gone, or perhaps it is the thought of seeing what can be accomplished when thought and effort are applied, or perhaps it's a way to escape all the drama of social media. We have all seen those home make over shows where we see some dilapidated house in shambles and then after some hard work and creativity, the home has all the elegance and charm that welcomes a new family to a dream come true. Looking at something as it was and seeing what it has become is rewarding. What many do as a hobby, our Lord does as a part of his profession. Our God is in the restoration business, He is definitely a god of restoration. He can restore all things, He can restore our bodies, as he did with the paralyzed man at Bethesda; He can restore our sight as he did with blind Bartimaeus; He can restore our hearing as he did with his enemy Malchus who lost his ear to Peter's sword; He can restore our minds as he did with the possessed man living among the tombs; He can restore nature itself; as he did when the storm that raged against the boat and he came out and said ""Peace. Be still.""; He can restore our resources as he did with the large quantity of fish that nearly broke the nets and nearly sank two boats; He can restore our finances like he did when the disciples went and got the coin out of the fishes mouth; He can restore our hearts, as he did when he said to God's people ""I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh"" and he can restore our lives as he did when he brought Lazaras back to life, after he had been dead three days; and He can even restore our very soul! Transition: We read from the psalms of how God restores our souls. In Psalm 23:1-3 ""The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not be in want. 2 He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside still waters, 3 'he restores my soul. ..."" I. Jesus restores our soul back to its original responsibility Notice How he starts this Psalm? He begins with ""The LORD is my Shepherd"" It is our responsibility to stay near the shepherd. Our soul only needs to be restored if our soul has been neglected. If you leave your lawn mower, or car, or a chainsaw or atv out in the rain, snow, and heat and never use it or bother to work on it, the more difficult it will be to use it once you decide to do so; after being neglected for so long, it will eventually be reclaimed by nature itself. There is an old saying ""the longer you are out of church the harder it is to get back in."" During an episode of American Pickers - The two friends looking for treasures in old barns and buildings to resale in their store, came across a friendly old couple, Jan and Sandy who lived in South Dakota. In the back of their barn under a mountain of dirt and trash was an old Auburn car (stopped being made in 1937). A deal was made that if the car was restored it would be driven back and let the old man drive it one last time. After being restored in Broken Arrow, Ok the old Auburn was on its way back to South Dakota where the old man had already passed away."
Joel 1:15-2:11,"('Eschatology', 'Divine Judgement')",Baptist," - Okay--it's the New Year. o So who made some resolutions for 2016? o Who has already broken some of your resolutions? - I don't really set new resolutions. o I just kind of recycle last year's and hope that I'll do better at keeping them than I did last year. - Resolutions are like that, aren't they? o We like to think about all the things that'll make us better people and we set goals to work toward. o But by the time February or March rolls around, most of us are back where we started from. - Maybe you do better than I do. o But I'll bet most of you don't. o I'd say that many of us don't even fool with making resolutions--because we know they'll be a waste of time. - In all seriousness--resolutions and goals for the New Year are fine. o They can be good motivators to help us get started on some things. - But if you've come here this morning expecting to get your head filled with a bunch of New Year's self-improvement ideas, you're going to be disappointed. o Because we've got bigger fish to fry than a bunch of surface-level self-improvement stuff. o We've got eternal things to consider. - This morning, we're going to start a 7-week series through the Old Testament book of Joel. o And trust me--even though it's only three short chapters, it's an incredibly weighty book. o This isn't going to be easy stuff--but I think it's going to hit us right where we are and get us to where we need to be. - Let's look at 1:1 for the introduction. JOEL 1:1 - That isn't much of an introduction, is it? o Most of the prophetic books of the Bible give us some clue as to who the person was that wrote it. o Not this one. - Here's all we know about Joel. o His name is a contraction of the two primary names for God--YHWH (Jehovah) and Elohim. o His very name is a testimony to the fact that YHWH is God above all. - That's all we know about the author--and on top of that, we don't know anything about when he gave this prophesy. o Most conservative scholars think the book was written sometime before the exile, probably during the reign of King Joash. - Here's the thing--unlike a lot of other books in the Bible, understanding the ""whos"" and ""wheres"" and ""whens"" don't have any impact at all in the way we understand what's going on here in Joel. o That's probably why the Holy Spirit didn't feel the need to let us know those things when He inspired and superintended the writing of this book. - We might not know much about Joel or the time he wrote his book, but we do know that the Holy Spirit wrote it through him--all of it. o In a nutshell, that's really the overview of the book. - Next week, we're going to start the verse-by-verse exposition. o But this morning, we're going to spend the rest of our time looking at the major theme of the book."
Joel 1:1-20,"('Eschatology',)",Baptist," - Have you ever been really desperate about something? o Maybe you lost your job and didn't have any way to pay your bills or didn't have any place to go. o Maybe you lost your home or your insurance and you didn't know what you were going to do. - I think the most helplessly desperate feeling you can have is when you have a spouse or a child who is suffering. o You desperately want whatever is wrong with them to go away--but you're absolutely helpless to do anything about it. - In those desperate times, you'd do anything in your power to make it better. - When I was studying this passage that we're looking at this morning, the phrase came to mind-- o ""Desperate times call for desperate measures."" - When we're confronted with desperate times, we can't just do things the way we've always been doing them, can we? o When things get really desperate, we need to start acting like it. - The people in Joel's day were experiencing some desperate times. o I doubt that anybody in here has experienced a locust invasion. o But look at how Joel describes it in verses 1-4: JOEL 1:1-4 - This kind of devastation hadn't ever happened in Israel before. o Joel starts off by saying that this locust invasion was the kind of thing that they were going to tell their great-grandkids about. o Kind of the way that a Londoner would tell stories about Hitler's air raids in WWII. - As Americans, we hear WWII stories of heroism and valor that was on display in Europe and the Pacific. o Londoners lived through the personal devastation and destruction of nightly bombings. o They would come out of their shelters to rubble and destruction. - They tell their stories different than we do. o And Joel knew that the people of Israel were going to tell their stories about the devastation that had happened around them. - And those three phrases in verse 4 don't come close to describing the absolute devastation they experienced. o Most scholars think Joel is describing four stages of locust growth. - If you are using an Old King James Bible, it looks like it's talking about four different kinds of critters. o It's not--it's one critter, in four developmental stages. - Here's the terrible thing about locusts--each stage of development destroys crops in a different way. o The larvae consume differently than ""hoppers"" or ""fliers"" do. - The bottom line is that the destruction is total and complete. o Locust swarms are estimated to contain up to 120 million insects per square mile. o And each locust consumes its own body weight every day it's alive. - During an unchecked locust invasion, every living plant is completely consumed. o But not only that, when the swarms finally die, millions of dead locust quickly rot and spread typhus and other diseases which kill the animals. - Locust plagues are so scary that today, there are international satellites that monitor for them and immediately send out aircraft with pesticides to kill them before they can get started."
"Matthew 5:13-16, Isaiah 58:7-10","('Justice', 'Salt And Light')",Catholic," Do you know the word ""sugar"" never occurs in the Bible? In ancient times salt was the ultimate seasoning that gave taste to food. We're called to be a flavorful people. ""You are the salt of the earth,"" Jesus says to the crowds. A colleague who does not like salt says that he wishes Jesus had said, ""You are the jalapeños of the earth,"" and then he continues paraphrasing: ""but if the chili has lost it's zest, it's like a bell pepper, good only for pizza."" 1. Salt of the earth (Matt. 5:13) has become proverbial for persons considered to be upstanding citizens who make contributions to the communities of which they are members. Salt is a metaphor for preservation, in the sense that Jesus' followers prevent society from degenerating into something worse than it already is. For example, Isaiah in Chapter 58, in our First Reading, says that God wants the people to share their food, clothing, and shelter with those who lack them. They had just returned from exile back to Jerusalem and they wanted the predicted restoration to happen. The prophet was saying that justice was needed first, then the restoration will go forward. God will honor a just society with the divine presence. There is a difference between kindness and doing justice. Kindness is giving Christmas presents to disadvantaged boys in working in coal mines. Doing justice is working to change the laws making it illegal for children to work in the coal mines in the first place. 2. Salt back then was often mixed with other minerals, it was not very pure. But, if one tries to wash the minerals away but ends up washing away salt, the salt could lose its taste if there more minerals left than actual salt. When that happened, it would be often thrown into street to keep the dust down. To lose flavor means to align oneself with values and goals that are antithetical to the Kingdom of God and its ideals. Trampled underfoot means a falsification of discipleship and puts one under sentence of judgement. There are eternal ramifications. Bonhoeffer writes, salt is useless if just stops working. Insipid disciples are those who have ceased to have any meaningful influence for good on earth. Reparation---Both the Fatima prayer and the prayer revealed to St. Faustina (which God subsequently instructed her to incorporate into the Divine Mercy Chaplet) are powerful prayers of reparation that are strikingly similar in structure. Both explicitly invoke the Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, in order to make reparation and obtain mercy and conversion for souls. Both are also mystically connected to the Eucharistic presence of Jesus, angels, and the Most Holy Trinity. 3. Salt is the quality of our own personal integrity. A Peanuts cartoon, showed Peppermint Patty talking to Charlie Brown. She said, ""Guess what, Chuck. The first day of school and I got sent to the principal's office. It was your fault, Chuck."" He said, ""My fault? How could it be my fault? Why do you say everything is my fault?"" She said, ""You're my friend, aren't you, Chuck?"
Joel 2:12-17,"('Prayer', 'Fasting')",Baptist," Do you ever come home from church and think, ""I think I understood the message this morning--but what am I supposed to do with it?"" Well, if that's ever happened to you before, it's not going to happen to you today. This morning, each of us is going to leave here knowing exactly what to do with what we've heard. If you haven't been with us over the past few weeks, we're in our third week in our study of the book of Joel. And in many ways, the passage we're looking at is the crux of the whole book. Joel has been preaching for a verdict. He wasn't just preaching a fluffy, feel-good, self-help message. He was preaching to the people about their real condition. And in preaching to them about their real condition, his goal wasn't to get them angry or depressed. His goal was to get them to do something. But here's the crazy thing--he wasn't trying to give them an inspiring motivational talk to get them to fix their problems in their own strength. Because here's the reality--they weren't capable of fixing their own problems in their own strength, were they? Remember what their immediate problem was--they were suffering through the aftermath of a terrible locust invasion. Their livelihood was destroyed. Their economy was in shambles. Their future was hopeless. They weren't even able to worship because there wasn't any grain or healthy animals to sacrifice. They were looking at starvation--both physically and spiritually. If I was preaching to them, let me tell you what I would have said. I would have told the people to get busy cleaning up the dead bugs. I would have told them to start plowing the fields. I would have told them to start sending out teams to get food from other areas. But that's not what the Prophet Joel did, is it? Now, there was a time for all those things eventually. But now wasn't that time. The first thing the people needed to do was to seek God's face and His favor in a uniquely desperate way. And that uniquely desperate way is called a Solemn Assembly. Folks--over the past couple of weeks, I hope you've had your eyes opened to exactly how desperate our situation is. In our world, in our region, and in our community--we are rapidly heading to the time when God will pour out His wrath on His creation. Throughout the Bible, and here in Joel, that time is called the Day of the Lord. Just as God poured out His wrath on creation the first time with water in Noah's day, He will pour out His wrath with fire in the Day of the Lord. Joel reminds us that the Day of the Lord is near. He's not saying that to give us a timeline. He's saying that the cup of God's wrath is almost full and his longsuffering and patience has almost come to an end. Peter describes it like this in 2 Peter 3:9-10: ""The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance. But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed."" Folks--that day is coming. We can see the evidence all around us. Christians are being brutally slaughtered around the world. Around the world, 40-50 million babies are being murdered in the womb each year. That means that every two minutes around the world, enough babies are aborted, that if they were allowed to grow up, they would fill this sanctuary. Sexual sin is promoted and celebrated--both heterosexual and homosexual. And on top of that, the seeds of anarchy are being sown around the world. We can see it in places like Egypt and Libya and Syria--and even closer to home in places like Ferguson and Baltimore and Chicago. And you need to understand that this isn't something that we're sheltered from here in our community. All you have to do is pick up a paper or watch the local news. Better yet, spend some time counseling the ladies who come into the Abel Center. Or talk to a school counselor or teacher. Or spend some time with one of our local social workers. Or talk with local law enforcement. Romans 1:29-31 says, ""They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless."" If you open your eyes, that describes even our area pretty well, doesn't it? Make no mistake about it--the Day of the Lord is near. We don't know when. But we do know that the cup of God's wrath is closer to overflowing than it's ever been before. I believe that we're in a uniquely desperate time--every bit as desperate as the people in Joel's day. And because we're in such a uniquely desperate time, I think it's time for us to call a Parkview Baptist Church to a Solemn Assembly the way Joel called his people to a Solemn Assembly. But if we're going to do that, then the first question we need to answer is--What is a Solemn Assembly? Look at verses 12 through the first part of 13:"
Joel 2:18-27,"('Rejoice Always', 'Rejoice In Adversity', 'Do Not Fear')",Baptist," - Alright--serious question.... Who in here is a morning person? o Who is definitely NOT a morning person? - One of the things I've learned over the years is that morning people like me can be really annoying to non-morning people. o I think I first learned that lesson when I was a kid at church camp. - When you're rooming with non-morning people, it is NOT a good idea to turn on the lights and sing ""Rise and shine and give God the glory"" first thing in the morning. o You might get a pillow or a shoe or whatever's handy thrown at you. - I'm sure that was kind of how the people in Joel's day were feeling when he gave them the message we're looking at this morning. - Remember the desperate situation they were in. o They had just gone through a devastating locust invasion. - They had no crops, so they had no food. o They had no way to make a living. o They had no grain offerings and their livestock was either dead or starving or diseased, so they had no way to offer burnt offerings. - They couldn't eat. They couldn't work. And they couldn't worship. o And here comes the prophet Joel with verse 21: JOEL 2:21 - The last thing you want to hear when you're going through a devastating time in your life is, o ""Hey--things aren't that bad! Cheer up and turn that frown upside down!"" - That's probably a case for justifiable homicide. o But I'm sure that's exactly how the people in Joel's day were feeling when he said what he did here. - ""Don't be afraid"": o What are you talking about Joel? I don't know how I'm going to feed my kids and you're telling me to not be afraid? - ""Be glad and rejoice"": o I've lost everything and now you're telling me to be happy about it? - ""The Lord has done great things"": o Well, if this is an example of the great things He's doing, I don't want any part of Him--no thank you. - Have you ever felt like that? o Maybe you lost your job or didn't get that promotion you think you deserved. o Maybe your doctor told you those words that nobody wants to hear. o Maybe you lost a child or a spouse or a parent. o Maybe life has smacked you in the face and things just aren't working out the way you hoped and dreamed. - Maybe you're seeing the locust invasion that's happening in our local economy with over 1000 coal mining jobs disappearing, dozens of railroad jobs going away, and local businesses closing left and right. o Before it's all said and done, there are going to be hundreds of job losses in our region's education system too. - Every one of us in here will be impacted in one way or another. o And in the middle of all that, God's Word through Joel is telling us, ""Don't be afraid. Be glad. Rejoice."" o Why? ""Because no matter what kind of locust invasion you're going through right now--the Lord has done great things."""
Joel 2:28-32,"('Holy Spirit', 'Eschatology')",Baptist," Who's ready for some pop culture trivia this morning? In the 18-49 age group, what has been the highest rated TV series for the past two seasons? The Walking Dead. In case you're not familiar with it, The Walking Dead is about some people trying to survive a zombie apocalypse. Who knows what the newly crowned Video Game of the Year is? Fallout 4. I'm obviously not a gamer, but I'm told that Fallout 4 is about life after a nuclear apocalypse. For the past two seasons, one of Fox's top comedies is a show called The Last Man on Earth, which is a nasty show about life on earth after a virus apocalypse. One of the most-hyped new shows on NBC this season is a show starring Rob Lowe called You, Me and the Apocalypse. It's about living in the days leading up to an asteroid apocalypse. You have to admit, in our culture today, there's a real fascination with the end of the world, isn't there? TV and movies try to imagine all the ways that it can happen--viruses, nuclear war, asteroids or comets, alien invasion, zombies, technology--even global warming. They try to figure out all the ways that it can happen, but the only reason they can keep generating ratings and selling tickets and video games is that, inherently, people know something's coming. And it isn't good. You see--God has planted an understanding of Himself and His coming wrath deep inside every person He's ever created. That's why even people who vehemently deny the existence of God will watch Doomsday Preppers. God hardwired us to know that this world is coming to an end one day. And I think that the current popular fascination with the apocalypse is a sign that it's coming soon. At least we know this--it's sooner now than it's ever been. But what's coming isn't a zombie apocalypse. It isn't somebody wandering around the earth looking for another survivor to have sex with. It isn't sitting with your AR-15 eating Beanie Weenies in a fallout shelter. The apocalypse isn't a Hollywood creation. But it is coming soon. And Joel gives us a glimpse of what it's going to be like in our passage this morning. Remember a few weeks ago, we started our look at this book by understanding the overall theme of what the prophet Joel is talking about. Throughout the book, the underlying theme has been the apocalypse--or as the Bible calls it, ""The Day of the Lord."" Remember we said The Day of the Lord is the time when God pours out His wrath on sin-marred and sin-scarred creation. Just like He destroyed everything on earth with water in Noah's day, one day He's going to destroy everything on earth with fire. I believe the Bible teaches that the Day of the Lord starts with the Rapture of the Church, and ends with the 1000-year rule of Jesus on earth called The Millennium. Just like Noah and his family were caught up in the ark and preserved from God's wrath in the flood, believers from the church age will be caught up in the Rapture and preserved from God's wrath in the apocalyptic Day of the Lord. For everybody who's left behind, the Day of the Lord will be a terrifying time. The Book of Revelation uses images of seals and trumpets and bowls and woes to describe the increasing horror of what it will be like for those who are alive during that time. Global disease and famine and war are just the beginning of it. Fire from space. Water turning to blood. Mass slaughter. Cruelty and horror like the world has never seen before. But in the midst of all that--God is still faithful to keep His promises. And our passage this morning specifically shows how God will keep His promises to Israel."
Joel 3:1-17,"('Retirement', 'End Times', 'Eschatology')",Baptist," If you've been with us throughout our study in the book of Joel, you'll remember the main theme of the book is the great and terrible day of the Lord. The great and terrible day of the Lord is the time that immediately leads up to the second coming of Jesus. It's a time that starts with the rapture of the church and ends with the second coming of Jesus which enters us into His 1000 year reign in the Millennial Kingdom. During the time known as the Day of the Lord, the final event before Jesus returns is a great and final war. You probably know it as the Battle of Armageddon. Here's how the book of Revelation describes the Battle of Armageddon: REVELATION 19:11-21 Do you know what's amazing to me? What's amazing to me is despite all the ways God pours out His wrath during this great and terrible Day of the Lord... even then, when God's holiness and righteousness and omnipotent power will be so graphically on display... even then, people will still reject Him. You'd think the more God shows His strength and righteousness that would cause more people to follow Him. But that's not the way it happens. The more openly God displays His righteousness, the more openly defiant people become in their rebellion. That's what's going to happen at the Battle of Armageddon. At the Battle of Armageddon, all the nations of the world will assemble to make war against God Himself. Joel tells about that war from Israel's perspective. Revelation tells about it from the church's perspective. Israel's perspective is that they're the boots on the ground, being attacked from all sides. By this point, they will have finally recognized Jesus as their Messiah and they're desperately waiting for Him to come and rescue them. And we--the believers who have been raptured--will be the armies led by Jesus, returning from heaven. As I said, Joel is describing it from Israel's perspective. And while he's using the imagery of war from Israel's perspective, he's also mixing in the imagery of a courtroom from God's perspective. That only makes sense, doesn't it? Because the Day of the Lord is a time of justice. All the wrong things of history will be made right. We will finally see ""fairness"" brought to creation. Throughout the passage, God uses judicial language. Verse 2 says, ""I will gather all the nations and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. And I will enter into judgment with them there, on behalf of my people and my heritage Israel, because they have scattered them among the nations and have divided up my land."" The Valley of Jehoshaphat is the place where all the nations will come out to make war against God and He will pass judgment on them. Jesus will lead the armies of heaven out against them--including us. But the battle is going to be over in no time. And the victory will be decisive. And the best part of all is that none of us is going to have to fire a shot. Because Jesus is going to win the battle with His Word. Revelation 19:14-15 describes it like this, ""And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, were following him on white horses. From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty."" Joel describes the same scene from Israel's perspective like this in verse 16: ""The LORD roars from Zion, and utters his voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth quake. But the LORD is a refuge to his people, a stronghold to the people of Israel."""
Joel 3:18-21,"('Heaven', 'Future', 'Eschatology', 'Millennial Kingdom')",Baptist," Back at the first of the year, we started our journey through the book of Joel. Week after week since then, we've talked about the nearness of the Day of the Lord. We've seen that the Day of the Lord will be a time when the cup of God's wrath is finally filled. His patience and longsuffering will have reached its end. And at that time, He will pour out His all-powerful pent-up wrath on all of sinful creation. We've seen all the ways that our days are inevitably leading up to that great and terrible day. And we've also seen how, apart from the saving grace of Jesus Christ, no one will be able to endure the Day of the Lord. Over the past several months, we've also seen how, by all outward evidence, at least 60% of our closest neighbors and billions of people scattered throughout the nations are lost without Christ. That means that if the Rapture was to happen today--each of those billions of people will suffer the unmitigated wrath of God. That ought to break our heart. It breaks our heart because we have seen that the task before us is too big for us. It's too big for our church. It's too big for our local associations of churches. It's too big for our state convention of churches. It's too big for all the churches of the Southern Baptist Convention. As a matter of fact, it's too big for all Bible-believing evangelical churches put together. But it's not too big for God. Because of that, one month ago, I stood right here in this pulpit and called us as a church to a Solemn Assembly of Prayer and Fasting--because we know that it's too big for us. So out of our broken humility, we as a church have been praying and fasting that God would do 5 things. We've been praying and fasting that we would see people saved and baptized. We've been praying and fasting that each of us would personally be delivered from any sin that regularly besets and entangles us. We've been praying and fasting that God will raise up leaders amongst us--pastors, church planters, missionaries, entrepreneurial business leaders. We've been praying and fasting that He would grow our church in supernatural unity. And finally, we've been praying and fasting that He would bring another Great Awakening to our nation. Today is the day that we set aside to break that fast. It's the end of our Solemn Assembly, but it's not the end of our prayer. Let's persistently continue to cry out to God day and night for those things. Because the Day of the Lord is great and terrible--who can endure it? So much of this series has been hard to hear. Let's face it, it's more fun to hear about almost anything than it is to hear about God's wrath. But if you take away God's wrath, His love doesn't mean anything. If you take away the promises of God's justice and righteousness, His mercy and grace is empty and hollow. Unless there's a real Hell to be shunned, then gaining Heaven doesn't really mean all that much. So after all this talk about the Day of the Lord, this is a wonderful way for the Holy Spirit to end this book through the prophet Joel. Here's what you need to understand this morning--most of your concepts about heaven are probably distorted. Heaven isn't a place of harps and clouds and halos. It isn't a bright light at the end of a tunnel. And it certainly isn't fishing or playing baseball with your pawpaw forever. There's no ""man upstairs."" There's no check-in desk with St. Peter. And no matter what Hank Williams or Bill Monroe used to sing--Jesus isn't building you a cabin in the corner of gloryland. Heaven is eternal--but it isn't static. The experience of heaven isn't clearly and exhaustively laid out in the Bible--mostly because in our flesh, I don't think we can fully comprehend what it will really be like. But here's what we do know. When a believer dies, our spirit is immediately in the presence of Jesus. The existence is real. It's conscious. It's blissful. But in this current state, our bodies are still in the ground and we haven't received our new, glorified bodies. Frankly, that's about all we know about this current state of Heaven from the Bible. In 2 Corinthians 12, Paul tells us that God allowed him to see it. But even though he was allowed to see it, God didn't let him tell us about it. By the way--that's one of the huge problems I have with books and movies like Heaven is for Real. If Paul was allowed to see the current state of Heaven but wasn't allowed to tell us about it authoritatively in inspired Scripture, why would God allow a 3-year old boy to? He wouldn't. So don't fall for it. Stick with what the Bible tells you about the current state of Heaven--which isn't much. For believers, when we die, our spirit is consciously, blissfully in the presence of Jesus. But as I said--that existence isn't static. Because at the Rapture, our spirits will be united with new glorified bodies. Think back to what happened when God first created Adam. The Bible says that God formed Adam's body out of the dust of the ground and breathed life into him and he became a living, material soul. The Hebrew and Greek words for breath is the same word for spirit. When we die, our spirit is torn from our physical bodies. At the Rapture, God will once again breathe our eternal spirits into our resurrected, newly glorified, recreated bodies and we will once again be living material souls. That's the way we're going to exist for the rest of eternity--once again as living souls. But this time with perfect, sinless, disease-free and pain-free bodies. Bodies that are holy and pure and not marred with sin and degradation. It's in that state that we will ride in behind Jesus for the Battle of Armageddon. And it's in that state that we will rule and reign with Him throughout the Millennial Kingdom that's described in Revelation 20. And it's in that state that we will reside in the final, ultimate state of Heaven--the Holy City New Jerusalem that's described in Revelation 21-22. Like most of the Old Testament prophets, Joel's description here is very brief. It's kind of a mashup of the Millennial Kingdom and the New Jerusalem. That shouldn't be a concern to us, because that's exactly what we do when we talk about Heaven. Rarely do we distinguish between the three states of Heaven--we just talk about how unimaginably awesome it's going to be to be with Jesus forever with no more sin or death or pain or sickness. I love to think about heaven--don't you? But here's something I've noticed lately. Just like you don't hear a lot of preaching about the end times these days, you don't hear a lot of preaching about heaven either. I think I know why that is. I think it's because there's a perception that when we think too much about heaven, we forget about what we're supposed to be doing till we get there. I've heard people accuse some believers of being so heavenly minded that they're no earthly good. Well here's the reality--the only way a believer can be any earthly good is if we're heavenly minded. So since this last passage in Joel has got us thinking about heaven--I want us to talk about four earthly goods that come from being heavenly minded."
2 Timothy 1:1-14,"('Strong Faith', 'Dark World')",Anglican," What advice would you give to someone if you knew that you were talking to them for the last time? That question was on the apostle Paul's mind when he wrote his final letter to Timothy. The passage we heard from 2 Timothy is part of Paul's last letter, and was written from his prison cell in Rome. He doesn't focus on his circumstances or his impending death. Instead, he focuses on the promise of life in Christ. Any Christian's earthly circumstances pale in comparison to the glory of eternity. Four times in this passage Paul uses a form of the verb, ""to remember""-remember, being mindful, remembrance, remind. No Christian is an island. All God's people stand on the shoulders of those who have preceded them. Paul encourages us to follow his example when it comes to living the Christian life. In particular, he urges us to use the gifts God has given us. These gifts fade in strength when they aren't used. For example, the greatest gift parents and grandparents can give their children is the heritage of genuine faith. An important question for any Christian to ask is: If you were standing on the threshold of eternity and looking back over your life, would you be able to see that your faith lives on in others, especially in your family members? A few years ago someone wrote to Billy Graham. The writer wondered how his grandmother, who had recently died, got a very strong faith. In his reply, Billy Graham said the following words: ""The Bible (which is God's Word) undoubtedly became important to her, as did prayer, and fellowship with other believers in her church. She also grew stronger spiritually by helping others and witnessing for Christ. The same can be true for us."" Fear usually enters our lives when we focus on our situation and abilities instead of God's sovereignty and attributes. Following fear to its logical conclusion will eliminate all opportunities for service. If we remember our spiritual heritage and friendships, as well as God's calling on our lives and the spiritual gifts he has given us, we will be encouraged as we move forward in faith. It will ignite a fire within us. If the fire of our faith goes out, it can be rekindled. All we have to do is make some changes and do some rearranging. For example, we can join or start a Bible study. All open doors offer two choices: to walk by faith or to be controlled by fear. Persecution, infighting, and false teaching all threatened the Ephesian church that Timothy shepherded. They will also threaten Christians in the last days before Christ returns. The fearful will drop out, but those who grab hold of the courage, compassion and self-control that God makes available will be able to stand fast until God completes His work in them. Christians will suffer for Christ in some way in this life, but it is far better that one's faith be marked by suffering than by shame at Christ or those who proclaim Him. Paul did not want Timothy to misunderstand his imprisonment. Paul understood who he served, and he was not ashamed. We can expect to face suffering and persecution just like Christ did. The glorious message of salvation is worthy of our suffering. God's grace and purpose bring life. Obeying God is the central purpose of Christian lives. That obedience includes love, mercy, justice and caring for the poor. All of these involve giving and sacrifice."
Joel 2:18-27,"('Restoration', 'Restoration Finances', 'Restoration By Grace')",Assembly Of God," Restoration Text: Joel 2:18-27 Introduction 1. Illustration: God does not hold our old sins against us, nor does He act like forgiveness is a favor to us, even though it is. When President Lincoln was asked how he would treat the rebellious southerners when they were defeated, he said, ""I will treat them as if they had never been away. 2. In a world obsessed with getting even and holding on to a grudge, I am glad that we serve a God who consistently looks to forgive and forget. 3. One of the many benefits of the atonement of Christ is something called ""justification,"" and the best way I've heard this described is ""just as if I'd never sinned."" 4. Not only does God forgive our sins, but he also restores what our sin robs from us. 5. God wants to... A. God Wants To Restore Us B. God Wants To Restore Our Blessings C. God Wants To Restore What The Devil Stole From Us 6. Let's stand together as we read Joel 2:18-27. Proposition: God's grace not only forgives our sin, it also restores the negative aspects of our sin. Transition: The first thing that God wants to do is... I. God Wants To Restore You (18-20). A. The Lord Will Pity His People 1. It's human nature to hold on to hurt, however, it is not God's nature. When he forgives he treats it as if it never happened. 2. In v. 18 the text turns from what God wants his people to do to what he is going to do. It says, ""Then the LORD will pity his people and jealously guard the honor of his land."" A. The verb (""pity"") looks inward toward the people rather than outward toward other interests. B. Yahweh directs his compassion and pity on his suffering people, just as Pharaoh's daughter did on the crying baby Moses. C. Verse 18 is a literary pivot in the book. Up to now, the problem has been presented and the response of the people has been called for. D. Now God's response unfolds. It is not introduced here, however, since the possibility (""who knows?"") of restoration was laid out in 2:14. E. Now that possibility is reality (""the LORD will""). The same structure is found in the Flood story, which built up to the climax of God's remembering Noah (Baker, The NIV Application Commentary - Joel, Obadiah, Malachi: From biblical text...to contemporary life, 75). 3. Then the Lord says, ""The LORD will reply, ""Look! I am sending you grain and new wine and olive oil, enough to satisfy your needs. You will no longer be an object of mockery among the surrounding nations."" A. God's promises expand in Joel 2:19, eradicating the problem and not simply making up for the loss of agricultural produce (1:10). B. The uncertainty of God's ""perhaps"" of 2:14 now becomes the certainty of his ""yes, I will."" C. In Hosea, God promises to respond to Israelite faithfulness by having the earth provide grain, wine, and oil (Hos. 2:21-22). D. This happens ""in that day,"" the Day of the Lord. God here responds (using the same verb, ?nh) through the same three agricultural products. E. For Joel, these events following the Judean response to God fulfill Hosea's prophecy (Baker, 76)."
Ephesians 4:31-32,"('Anger', 'Kindness')",Christian/Church Of Christ," INTRODUCTION "" SLIDE #1 "" AUGUST 8, 2011. MOBILE COUNTY, Alabama -- A minister of music at a church in the St. Elmo community Tased the pastor who had just fired him Sunday, touching off a fight and various knife slashing's, according to the Sheriff's Office. Mobile County deputies were called just after 1 p.m. to New Welcome Baptist Church in the 8600 block of Boe Road. "" The mayhem erupted when the Rev. Darryl Riley told minister of music Simone Moore that he was no longer needed and gave him a final paycheck, the Sheriff's Office reported. "" Moore disagreed with the amount of the check and an argument broke out, in which Moore wielded a Taser gun, according to the account given to deputies. "" Several church members became involved, including Agolia Moore, the music minister's mother, who suffered a stab wound at the hands of a deacon, according to the Sheriff's Office. "" The deacon was identified as Harvey Hunt. People hurt in the fight were treated at a hospital and released to go home, officials said. "" As we continue with our series TURNING OVER A NEW LEAF, we have been contrasting our old way of life before we were in Christ, with the new life we are called to live. "" Today we will continue with that theme. "" When you look at the world around you, it becomes apparent that folks have problems getting along with one another. "" We see this in the world and unfortunately we have seen it in the church. "" We are seeing the worst in people in our country since the elections because folks have no comprehension of what tolerance is nor do they know how to respect those with opposing views. "" We live in a tumultuous world, and a big reason for is that people are treating one another in ugly ways, in selfish ways. "" Today we contrast the way the world has taught us to treat people with the way one in Christ is called to treat others. "" I think most of us want a better world, that better world will never happen until folks learn how to treat one another the way God calls us. "" It must start with the church; we must be the example if we hope to change the world for the better. "" This world will never be the utopia we would all like it to be, but if we learn how to treat one another, we can all make it a better place to live until we get to see Jesus in our permanent home in Heaven!

"Hebrews 7:1-24, Genesis 14:18-20","('Melchizedek', 'The Aaronic Priesthood', 'The Melchizedek Priesthood')",Assembly Of God," The trials of Jesus. The night before Jesus was sentenced to death by crucifixion, He was arrested and tried seven times (some note six based on how these trials are counted). They included: 1. The trial before Annas: John 18:12-14, 19-23 include the details of the first Jewish trial of Jesus. Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas the high priest. 2. The trial before Caiaphas: All four Gospels record this trial (Matthew 26:57-68; Mark 14:53-65; Luke 22:54, 63-65; John 18:24), with Matthew offering the most detailed account. We are told Caiaphas was high priest that year and had predicted one man should die on behalf of the people. In this second trial, the religious leaders gathered together, bringing many false witnesses against Jesus. Jesus spoke of Himself as the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power, a clear reference to Himself as Messiah. The high priest tore his clothes, claiming Jesus had given evidence worthy of death on His own. 3. The trial before the Sanhedrin: All three Synoptic Gospels record this third Jewish trial (Matthew 27:1; Mark 15:1; Luke 22:66-71) that took place ""as soon as it was day"" (Luke 22:66). Jesus again referred to Himself as the Son of Man and was delivered to the Roman leader Pilate for trial. 4. The trial before Pilate: All four Gospels record this trial (Matthew 27:1-2, 11-14; Mark 15:1-5; Luke 23:1-7; John 18:28-32, 33-38), with John giving an extended account. Pilate found nothing worthy of death to condemn, sending Jesus to King Herod. 5. The trial before Herod: Only Luke records this trial (Luke 23:6-12). Herod hoped to see a miracle, though Jesus answered none of the charges against Him. Herod and his men mocked Jesus and sent Him back to Pilate with a kingly robe. 6. The second trial before Pilate: All four Gospels record this trial (Matthew 27:15-23; Mark 15:6-14; Luke 23:13-22; John 18:39-19:6). In the end, Pilate claimed to have nothing to do with the punishment of Jesus, leaving the fate of Jesus to the crowd in the form of allowing them to choose freedom for Jesus or to release a known criminal named Barabbas. 7. The trial of the Jewish people: The Jews who had gathered for Passover shouted ""Crucify! Crucify!"" and chose freedom for Barabbas rather than Jesus. Jesus was then sentenced to Roman crucifixion. In total, three Jewish trials took place followed by three Roman trials, concluding with an appeal to the Jewish people with the consent of a Roman leader. Both Jews and Gentiles were responsible for the call to put Jesus to death. Jesus the New High Priest after the order of Melchizedek (Part 1) Matthew 26:57-26:65 This study is designed to strengthen our knowledge and understanding of God's Word and how He interacts with His children. It is my hope that by studying the ancient customs and cultures of the Bible God's Word will come alive for you, and you will be that much more confident in the truth found in its pages. The Aaronic priesthood originally instituted by God in the wilderness had reached the end of its usefulness by the time that Christ was born into this world. The priesthood was corrupt and defiled and so God transferred the honor and glory of the priesthood onto Christ, His Son."
"Matthew 26:57-65, Hebrews 8:1-9:15","('Melchizedek', 'The Aaronic Priesthood', 'The Priesthood Of Melchizedek')",Assembly Of God," The trials of Jesus - Part 2 Jesus the New High Priest after the order of Melchizedek Jesus had become a grave threat to the priesthood and religious powers of the day. Here was a man who was forgiving people of sins, healing people, bringing people back to life. He challenged the strict manmade dictates of their religion that put meaningless tradition above the needs of the people. He taught the multitudes and cared for them. Basically, Jesus did everything that the Aaronic priesthood was supposed to be doing, but wasn't. He had truly taken on the role of a priest. He was threatening the power that the religious authorities had over the people, and they didn't like it. But He was a threat to the political authorities of that day as well, because Jesus had been born of the house and lineage of David, the rightful King of the Jews. So, Jesus was a man with the power and authority of a priest and a king, and the people loved Him. On Palm Sunday the Jews of the city hailed Him as their king and Messiah. Jesus was a political threat to the Roman government who didn't want an uprising of the Jews to have to deal with, and He was a religious threat to the Aaronic priesthood who could see their authority being undermined by their peoples' worship and following of Him as their Messiah. A. Jesus before Caiaphas. So the priests arrested Jesus and brought Him to trial, and this is what our main teaching is going to concern today. Let's look at Matthew 26:57-59, ""Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled. [58] But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome. [59] The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death. [60] But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward."" These men were so afraid of the power that Jesus held and the things that He was teaching that they wanted to kill him. They wanted to get rid of Him so badly that they were looking for false evidence against Him. They didn't want the truth, they were looking for lies. They wanted to get rid of Him even if the witnesses and evidence brought against Him were false. That's how threatened they felt. But notice that even though they found many people who came forward and lied about Jesus, they still didn't find any evidence against Him powerful enough to sentence Him to death. B. No Defense Let continue reading with Matthew 26:61-63, ""Finally two came forward and declared, 'This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'' [62] Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, ""Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?"" [63] But Jesus remained silent..."" Jesus didn't say a word in His defense against the false witnesses or all the false testimony being brought against Him. Truthfully, it probably wouldn't have done much good anyway. His accusers were going to believe what they wanted. They were searching for any reason they could find to kill Him."
Psalms 23:1-8,"('Psalms', 'Wisdom')",Independent/Bible," HIS SHEEP AM I (PSALM 23) Have you heard of the computer user's version of Psalm 23? The Lord is my programmer, I shall not crash. He installed His software on the hard disk of my heart. All of His commands are user friendly. His directory guides me to the right choices for His name's sake. Even though I scroll through the problems of life, I will fear no bugs, for He is my back-up. His password protects me. He prepares a menu before me in the presence of my enemies. His help is only a keystroke away. Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life and my file will be merged with His and saved forever. Amen Psalms 23 is the most beloved psalm in the Bible and the shepherd analogy is the most popular analogy in the Bible. A pastor says, ""Psalms 23 is the most quoted and memorized poem in history"" and a writer says it is the most repeated and cited chapter in the Bible. A renowned pastor Coffman remembers quoting Psalms 23 at every one of the one hundred funerals that he held in 1937. What kind of a relationship do we have with the Lord and how do we deepen our relationship to Him? Why must we closely and consistently follow our Savior and Shepherd? No Supply is Surer 1 The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing. 2 He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, 3 he refreshes my soul. He guides me along the right paths for his name's sake. Once I went to my clubhouse for my morning swim and my club card got entangled with small bills in my pocket. I joked to the lady who manned the morning shift: ""There goes my money. Now I cannot be rich anymore!"" She said, ""Mr. Yip, it is not necessary to be rich; having enough is OK."" The shepherd is the most beloved analogy for God in the Bible. In the Old Testament the Lord is known as the Shepherd of Israel (Ps 80:1), and in the New Testament Jesus is the good shepherd (John 10:11), that great shepherd of the sheep (Heb 13:20), the Shepherd and Bishop of souls (1 Peter 2:25) and the chief Shepherd (1 Peter 5:4). We, on the other hand, are the sheep of His pasture (Ps 74:1, 79:13, 100:3) and the sheep of His hand (Ps 95:7). The noun ""shepherd"" may also be translated as keeper (Gen 4:2), feed (Gen 29:7), a companion (Prov 13:20), friendship (Prov 22:24) and pastors (Jer 3:15). It is more a title; it is a task. It is practical more than positional. It is a duty more than a designation. The shepherd is dear, dedicated and dependable, never distant, dreaded or disliked. The verb ""lack"" (v 1) is traditionally translated as abated (Gen 8:3), decrease (Gen 8:5) and bereave (Eccl 4:8). The same phrase ""lack nothing"" is repeated in eight other verses - half of which famously referred to the wilderness experience where those who gathered little had no lack (Ex 16:18), where they spent forty years lacking nothing (Deut 2:7), eating bread without scarceness (Deut 8:9), experiencing God's sustenance in the wilderness (Neh 9:21). Other passages outside of the wilderness experience include Elijah's promise of oil without fail to the widow of Zarephath (1 Kings 17:14), no want of any good thing (Ps 34:10), husbands with capable wives who have no need of spoil (Prov 31:11), and the promise of bread without fail for the exile (Isa 51:14). The shepherd is tender, tenacious and, most of all, trustworthy. We are never short, stranded or starved with our shepherd around us and attending us. There is no hunger, harm, hazard, hurry or heartbreak with Him around."
Psalms 8:1-9,"('Psalms', 'Majesty Of God')",Independent/Bible," HOW MAJESTIC IS YOUR NAME (PSALM 8) We've picked out some of the most awe-inspiring and meaningful moments from the history of humanity's journey to space. 1. Ed White, 3 June 1965, 1965, Gemini 4, pilot, he became the first American to ""walk"" in space: ""I'm coming back in... and it's the saddest moment of my life."" 2. Neil Armstrong on looking back at the Earth from the Moon in July 1969: ""I didn't feel like a giant. I felt very, very small."" 3. Frank Borman, Apollo 8: It makes us realize that we all do exist on one small globe. For from 230,000 miles away it really is a small planet. 4. Alan Shepard, Apollo 14: If somebody'd said before the flight, ""Are you going to get carried away looking at the earth from the moon?"" I would have say, ""No, no way."" But yet when I first looked back at the earth, standing on the moon, I cried. 5. Roger B Chaffee, Apollo 1: The world itself looks cleaner and so much more beautiful. Maybe we can make it that way--the way God intended it to be--by giving everybody that new perspective from out in space. 6. James B. Irwin, Apollo 15: As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man. 7. Edgar Mitchell, Apollo 14: My view of our planet was a glimpse of divinity."" http://www.spacequotations.com/earth.html The creation of the world and man is one of the strongest arguments for the existence of God. Many believers are uncomfortable and prefer not to call creation a theory rather than a truth. Genesis begins emphatically, ""In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth"" (Gen 1:1). All life origins from God and is a gift from Him. Life is an intelligent design, a complex matter and a divine gift. Why did God create the heavens and the earth? What is the chief purpose of man? How are we to govern the world He gave us? Sing His Praise 1 Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory in the heavens. 2 Through the praise of children and infants you have established a stronghold against your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger. A visiting farmer stopped at a city restaurant to eat lunch. When he was served his food he bowed his head and gave thanks to the Lord. Some teenagers sitting at a nearby table noticed the farmer's prayer and shouted, ""Hey, pops, back where you come from does everybody pray before they eat?"" Their laughter was silenced when the unmoved farmer answered, ""No, the hogs don't."" ""O Lord our Lord"" is not a word repetition because the titles are different in Hebrew. The first title (Yahweh) is the name of Israel's God, but the second title (Adonai) is translated as ""lord"" 228 times and ""master"" 105 times in KJV, therefore it should be correctly translated as O Lord our Master."" Out of respect for the name that has no vowel, The Jews substitute Adonai for YHWH in reading, thus the English translation O Lord our Lord. The difference between the two is that the first is strictly the title, the respect, translated as Lord, O Lord or the Lord, whereas the second is the trust, a relationship. In the Psalms He is our Lord (Ps 8:1, 147:5), thy Lord (Ps 45:11), the Lord of the whole earth (Ps 97:5), my Lord (Ps 110:1), the Lord (Ps 114:7), the Lord of lords (Ps 136:3) in the Psalms. The first is His rule and the second the respect, the designation versus the devotion. The first speaks of his omnipotence, omniscience and ownership, but the second smacks of obedience, openness and obligation. It serves as an acknowledgement, an admiration and an assurance."
Psalms 121:1-8,"('Death', 'Psalms', 'Psalm 121')",Independent/Bible," KEEPER OF MY SOUL (PSALMS 121) The famous English deist, Anthony Collins of the 17th century, met a plain countryman one day while out walking. He asked him where he was going. ""To church, sir."" ""What are you going to do there?"" ""Worship God."" ""Is your God a great or a little God?"" ""He is both, sir."" ""How can He be both?"" ""He is so great, sir, that the heaven of heavens cannot contain Him; and so little that He can dwell in my heart."" The unbeliever Collins later declared that this simple answer from the countryman had more effect upon his mind than all the volumes which learned doctors had written against him. T (from Illustrations of Bible Truths # 918) Ps 121 is the second song of a series of songs called Song of Ascents that begin in the last chapter, Psalms 120. There are 15 such songs from Psalms 120-134. They are also variously called Gradual Psalms, Songs of Degrees, Songs of Steps or Pilgrim Songs. Four of them (Ps 122, 124, 131 and 133) are linked in their ascriptions to David, and one (127) to Solomon. Many scholars believe these psalms were sung by the worshippers as they ascended the road to Jerusalem to attend the three pilgrim festivals (Deuteronomy 16:16) or were songs of the priests as they ascended the fifteen steps to minister at the Temple in Jerusalem. They are characterized by brevity - only Psalm 132 has more than ten verses, by a key-word, by repetition. More than half of them are cheerful, and all of them hopeful. (Wikipedia) Some suggested David was the author of Psalm 121, others attributed it to an unknown traveler, a soldier and mariner (Robert Hawker), or a captive Levite (Calmet). Who do you turn to or talk to when you are down or defeated? What is the cause of troubles in your life? How does the Lord help His people or children when they are troubled? Nobody knows the trouble I've seen The Lord is Your Support: None is As Superior (vv 1-2) 1 I lift up my eyes to the mountains-- where does my help come from? 2 My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth. (Psalm 121:1-2) A Google image says, ""Be strong enough to stand alone, to know when you need help, and brave enough to ask it."" Do you ask for help regularly, reasonably, rarely, reluctantly or regrettably? Here are some reasons: ""I don't ask for help because.... People always seem to let me down. People don't completely understand me I seem like I'm weak or stupid. (Other feelings: fear, embarrassed, rejected, judged, less capable, shame) It's just easier for me to do something than to explain it to someone else. I'm too proud to admit I don't know. I can do it better or faster. I don't want to bother or burden others I'm afraid no one will help me I am too shy I am the leader A song of ascent is a song that goes up, mounts up or rises up, to the temple steps or mountain range. It can be called a mountain song, hill song or cliff song. No matter what, it is an uphill attempt to uplift, uphold and upbuild the person or pilgrim. The early KJV begins with the remarkable interrogative form in the footnote: ""Shall I lift up mine eyes to the hills? Whence should my help come?"" The singer is weighed down by difficulties, disappointments and doubts. It is for the weary, the worried and the weak."
Revelation 14:1-5,"('144,000', 'Voice Of Many Waters', 'Voice Of A Great Thunder', 'Not Defiled With Women')",Baptist," Lesson: IV.A.4: The Lamb and the 144,000 on Mount Zion (Revelation 14:1-5) Series: Verse By Verse Through Revelation ? Revelation 14:1-5 (KJV) 1 And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads. 2 And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: 3 And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth. 4 These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb. 5 And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God. Introduction Introduction to Chapter 14 With chapter 14 there comes a change and a turning of the tide. The ebb sets in and flows faster and ever faster, as God takes over in direct and determined intervention in the affairs of men. From here on, we have set before us a picture of a world rescued by God. This is a long section of the book and covers a very long period of time. It runs on to the end of chapter 20, and thus covers the final throes of the great tribulation, the battle of Armageddon, the golden millennial` age, the final rebellion of Satan, the great white throne judgment, and onto the edge of eternity. In chapter 14, we see God's response to the attack of the two beasts described in chapter 13. The beast's goal, from the beginning, has been to stop the Messiah, destroy the Jews and persecute the church. Here God claims His own and begins the final harvest. Chapter 14 gives a glimpse into eternity to show believers what awaits them if they endure. Their suffering will not be meaningless; it will only be a prelude into eternity with God. This chapter explains what will happen to those who refuse to receive the mark of the beast, and what will happen eventually to the beast and his servants. Introduction to Verses. 1-5 If I were to give a title to this chapter it would be ""Protection."" In this lesson, God prevents the plan of the beast from coming to fruition by sealing 144,000 people to keep them from being killed by the beast. He will seal them with a sign on their foreheads (1). We have met this company before. This is the illustrious company of the 144,000 from the twelve tribes of Israel, who are sealed (Revelation 7). These sealed ones have been preserved unharmed throughout the great tribulation, despite the rage of the dragon and the beast. Unscathed, they have marched right down those dreadful years with horrors abounding on every hand and with every demon from the pit clutching at them in vain. In chapter seven this company is seen anticipating the great tribulation which, at the time, lay ahead. They are now seen anticipating the great triumph, which at that time, lay ahead."
Mark 9:14-29,"('Doubt', 'Growth', 'Prayer', 'Demons')",Baptist," Coming Off the Mountain Mark 9:14-29 February 4-5, 2017 Rev. Brian Bill Beth and I are coming off a mountaintop experience as we just returned from a week in Virginia to see Jamie and Lydia, our son-in-law and daughter, who just happen to be the parents of our grandson Philip, or as he's more affectionately known - Pip. Here are a few piptures... It was wonderful to spend time with them for a few days and while we wish we could have stayed longer, we're not meant to live on the mountaintop. Deuteronomy 11:11 says: ""But the land that you are going over to possess is a land of hills and valleys..."" The Christian life has mountaintop experiences and excruciating valleys; faith and doubt; victories and defeats; triumphs and trials; praises and problems; joy and junk. Last weekend we focused on the splendor and supremacy of Jesus as He was transfigured on top of the mountain. We learned that a glimpse of glory will keep us going. While Peter may have wanted to turn this experience into a prolonged camping trip, Jesus wants His followers to know that they can't stay on the mountaintop. The air is too thin, there's not much to eat and there's work to be done in the valley. If we want to share in the glory above, we must follow Him into sufferings below. The glory on the mountain helps us deal with the garbage in the valley. Almost 500 years ago a painter named Raphael captured these two truths when he showed the glory of the transfiguration in the top half of a painting and the suffering of people at the bottom. The two scenes are actually joined together as we will see in our passage today. Please turn to Mark 9. The Situation in the Valley As Peter, James and John are descending the mountain with Jesus, they're involved in a theological discussion about Elijah. As they come back to the reality of sin, suffering, Satan and sickness, at least four things hit them. 1. Large crowds. They no doubt enjoyed their spiritual retreat away from the throngs of people but that all changes in verse 14: ""And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them..."" While the three were up on the mountain, the other nine were hip deep in need. When Christ shows up, the crowd crushes around Him in verse 15: ""And immediately all the crowd, when they saw him were greatly amazed and ran up to him and greeted him."" To be ""greatly amazed"" means, ""greatly alarmed and utterly astonished."" 2. Lots of conflict. Whenever you have lots of people, you have lots of problems. Someone has said, ""Where there's two or three gathered...there's conflict."" Specifically, we read that the ""scribes were arguing with them."" The scribes were religious experts and were disputing with the disciples because they couldn't help a hurting boy. The word for ""arguing"" means, ""to mock and confront."" In verse 16, Jesus asks, ""What are you arguing about with them?"" I love how this question draws the attention away from the humiliated disciples and puts it on the holiness of Christ. In verse 18, we read that the disciples were not able to cast out a demon that was set on destroying a young boy: ""So I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able."" Those closest to Christ were powerless to help. I wonder if people look at Christ followers in a similar way today? When we're faced with real needs and problems, do people wonder why the church is so impotent and out of touch?"
Jude 1:1-25,"('Jude', 'Eschatology')",Independent/Bible," CONTEND FOR THE FAITH (JUDE 1) Cults are prevalent and persistent in Hong Kong. Mormons in white shirts are a common sight at Kwai Fong MTR station where I board. The Mormon Church has about 58,000 missionaries serving in 347 missions worldwide and they have lowered the minimum age of missionaries for men from 19 to 18 and for women from 21 to 19. http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/02/28/mormon-missionaries-get-an-earlier-start-raring-to-go/1954261/ Jehovah Witnesses distribute their literature publicly on the bridge connecting IFC mall and the Star Ferry piers. The controversial Eastern Lightning cult from China has been pulling up their banners in outside many MTR stations and placing their ads in local newspaper. The early church not only had to contend and counter on a regular basis against civil authorities and internal infighting but also false teachings. The last is hard to fight against because they are religious counterfeits and work undercover. They wear the cloak of religion and talk spiritual things, but they are not Christians. What makes a cult a cult? How do you identify them? What strategies do they use? How shall deal with them? Be Awake - Cults Will Prosper 1 Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James, To those who have been called, who are loved by God the Father and kept by Jesus Christ: 2 Mercy, peace and love be yours in abundance. 3 Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I felt I had to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints. 4 For certain men whose condemnation was written about long ago have secretly slipped in among you. They are godless men, who change the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord. (Jude 1-4) One time in Los Angeles a group of visitors came packed in a van. Before I could come out to greet them, they have left. They shook hands, gave out leaflets and CDs, and left before I could come out to greet them. Later I found they were the latest and hottest cult from China, Eastern Lightning. The Eastern Lightning or the Church of Almighty God cult has an estimated one million adherents. According to the Christian Research Journal, a man named Zhao Weishan from a charismatic church founded the movement in Heilongjiang province in 1989. Zhao later moved to Henan province, where he began to teach that Jesus Christ had returned to Earth in the form of a Henan woman named Deng. Zhao reportedly immigrated to America in 2000. http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/17/world/la-fg-china-doomsday-arrests-20121218 The group teaches that Deng (邓闪电) was to guide mankind for the third and last time, the first and second occasions being Jehovah of the Old Testament and as Jesus in the New Testament. The Chinese government arrested more than one thousand of its members because the cult controversially predicted that the world will end on December 21, 2012, in accordance with the Mayan calendar and"

Exodus 3:1-15,"('Moses', 'Wisdom', 'I Am', 'Names Of God')",United Methodist," I AM that I AM Exodus 3:1-15 It was business as usual in all the rest of the world. The world was entirely ignorant of an event that was to take place in a remote desert. Yet it is what happened here that has changed the world and not whatever decrees might have come that day from the throne of Pharaoh or the talk in the street about politics, the economy, or some other subject. This often is the way that God works. Yet when He speaks to a fugitive in the middle of nowhere, His word comes to pass. Moses was a miracle child, a type of the miracle child who would later be born in a mange in Bethlehem. The decree had gone forth from Pharaoh that all the Israelite male children were to be cast into the river (Exodus 1:22). His mother hid him for three months but eventually complied with the order. But Moses instead of being cast out into the river to drown was placed in a little boat and left to the mercy of God. We read that this child floating in a boat was caused to be found by Pharaoh's daughter whom God put pity in her heart. She knew this child was a Hebrew, yet had her raided in her house as her son. So Moses was raided as the Scripture says in all the learning and wisdom of Egypt. He would have learned about Egypt's gods and his standing as part of Pharaoh's family his being enrolled among them. Moses who had to be nursed was providentially nursed by his own mother. From this he seems to have learned his true identity as an Israelite. When he was older, he saw a Egyptian taskmaster mistreating a fellow Hebrew and killed the man and hid his body. But he was found out and betrayed by one of his own countrymen and had to escape for his life. This was the occasion for his removal to the backside of the desert. Thus ended the first forty years of the life. Moses would spend the next forty years of his life as a shepherd guiding sheep through the wilderness. It seems like quite a demotion in life. But in forty years, Moses knew where to find forage for his sheep and to know good water from bad. In order to survive, he had to be an expert. Moses had probably seen dry bushes erupt into flames before in the dry hot desert, but today was different. The bush he saw on fire did not disintegrate into ashes. The fire kept on burning. God used Moses' curiosity to attract him to this place. What we see here is a magnificent encounter between the Lord and Moses. Moses was in no need of some sort of argument about the existence of God. He did not chance upon the ontological argument or teleological argument. Rather He was personal encountered by God Himself. What we learn here is that God is self-authenticating. Moses did not find God through his advanced learning and wisdom, not even the truths that his mother had shared about God. Rather God allowed Himself to be found. God is not in any way bound by human wisdom and expectation. He cannot be found by such means. He only can be known by His revelation and only to the extent that He wishes to be revealed. The Lord did not reveal Himself to the world that day but just one person. And He did so to reveal to Moses that he was chosen by the Lord as His instrument to deliver them from the cruel bondage of Egypt and lead them out."
Psalms 145:1-21,"('Worship', 'Praise', 'Revival', ""God's Attributes"")",Independent/Bible," Today is Super bowl Sunday. There is no bigger sports phenomena in the world for a combination of viewership, marketing, advertising and hype. As excited as people get for sporting events, it's no exaggeration that there are Super bowl fanatics. Celebrating their favourite team, and player, they gather together today with their friends, and with great enthusiasm for this special event. The final section of Davidic psalms (Ps. 138-145) is concluded by a song of praise in Psalm 145 that extols the universal kingship of God and his gracious and just provision for all his creatures. Psalm 145 is the capstone of all the acrostic, or alphabetic, psalms (see also 9-10; 25; 34; 37; 111-112; 119). Like four other acrostic psalms (9-10; 25; 34), this one is incomplete: the Hebrew alphabet having twenty-two letters, only twenty-one verses appearing in this psalm (Hindson, E. E., & Kroll, W. M. (Eds.). (1994). KJV Bible Commentary (p. 1185). Nashville: Thomas Nelson.).Among all the psalms with titles, this is the only one that uses the word 'praise' (Heb., tehillâh), which word also reappears in the final verse ('in praise of the LORD', tehillat yhwh). In heaven, we shall praise the Lord forever and forever, but now is the time to get prepared as we praise Him from day to day. No matter how dark and difficult the day may be, there is always something for which we can praise the Lord--even if it is only that the situation is not always this bad! (Wiersbe, W. W. (2004). Be exultant (1st ed., p. 210). Colorado Springs, CO: Cook Communications Ministries.) People celebrate what they are most excited about. What runs through our minds and what is shown in our enthusiasm, shows what we delight in. Regardless of what we profess, we show what or whom we most value. It's not hard to listen to our words, see in our enthusiasm and watch our activities to understand our value system. When God has transformed a heart and brought revival through His people there is a change in their thoughts, language, actions, but most specifically in their worship. Through The Revival of Praise and Worship, God and His actions is the language of a people's praise, and the worshipful delight of their hearts. In Psalm 145, we see The Revival of Praise & Worship through the adoration of 1) God's Greatness (Psalm 145:1-6) 2) God's Goodness (Psalm 145:7-10) 3) God's Government (Psalm 145:11-13) and 4) God's Grace (Psalm 145:14-21). The Revival of Praise & Worship through the adoration of: 1) God's Greatness (Psalm 145:1-6) Psalm 145:1-6 I will extol you, my God and King, and bless your name forever and ever. 2 Every day I will bless you and praise your name forever and ever. 3 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised, and his greatness is unsearchable. 4 One generation shall commend your works to another, and shall declare your mighty acts. 5 On the glorious splendor of your majesty, and on your wondrous works, I will meditate. 6 They shall speak of the might of your awesome deeds, and I will declare your greatness.

"Luke 24:21, 1 Peter 3:15","('Hope', 'Hopelessness', 'New Hope')",Christian/Church Of Christ," A True Hope How many of you have made a New Year's Resolutions? Every year right before the new year I start planning for the upcoming year. I make a few resolutions and hopes for the new year. It's the time of year I work to get the budget under control and (Dave Ramsey myself out of debt with the debt snowball). It's the time of year I work to get my waistline back inside the clothes I bought ten years ago. It's the time of year when I plan to make the upcoming year better than the last one. It is the time of year that new goals and hopes are on my mind. (""HOPE"" graphic) It's the time of year that the phrase ""This is the year I am going to (You fill in the blank)_________ : do, complete, start, restart, try again finally finish, get married, do the things I have always wanted to do and the biggy that most Americans look forward to the year they retire. It's the time of year that I hope for the best for my kids in the upcoming year. It's the time of year that I hope to see the Church reach more of those that are lost. Generally the start of the new you I have a positive outlook for the upcoming year. Now because I am an optimist. I do this every year even though during that last year I did not succeed at accomplishing all or part of the very same things. What is it with us that we keep doing this each year? Now here's what I know about you!!! You do the very same things that I do. January the start of a new year is and has always been a time when we start over with a new mindset to be better but the truth is this. You are probably struggling with debt. You are probably struggling with your waistline. You want this year to be better than the last one but wonder if it will ever be true. ""This is the year that you are going to also, do, complete, start, restart, try again finally finish, get married, get divorced, do the things you have always wanted to do and maybe even for you this is the year that you are going to retire. If you have kids you are hoping for the best for your kids in the upcoming year. If you are a Christian you may also be hoping to see the Church reach more of those that are lost. Now because you also have some small amount of optimism left in you, you more than likely do this ever year just like I do. Even though during the last year you did not succeed at accomplishing all or part of the very same things either. What is it with us that we keep doing this over and over every year? Why year after year do we keep planning and hoping for the next year to be better than the last year? It is because we all have in us and for that matter have to have in us some form of hope. Hope that things are going to be better. The Baker encyclopedia says that ""Hope is this... ""An expectation or belief in the fulfillment of something desired. ... uncertainty over what the future holds creates the constant need for hope."" So basically we hope for the best because so much is unknown. So far all I have talked about are the positive aspects of hope. The kind of hope that spurs us on to be better at life. To be better whether we ever become better or not we continue to try."
Psalms 90:1-17,"('David', 'Psalms')",Independent/Bible," FROM EVERYDAY TO ETERNITY (PSALM 90) Mickey's wife bought a new line of expensive cosmetics guaranteed to make her look years younger. After a lengthy sitting before the mirror applying the ""miracle"" products, she asked, ""Darling, honestly, what age would you say I am?"" Looking over her carefully, Mickey replied, ""Judging from your skin, twenty; your hair, eighteen; and your figure, twenty five."" ""Oh, you flatterer!"" she gushed. ""Hey, wait a minute!"" Mickey interrupted. ""I haven't added them up yet."" The last year 2015 was characterized by the 4Ts - terror (ISIL), trouble (Occupy Central) and tragedy (New Year stampede, a capsized ship, coal-mine explosions and fires, and a toppled building). Psalms 90 is unique in three ways: (1) It is the oldest psalm written by the oldest man in the post-Genesis era. Psalms 91-100 is traditionally ascribed to Moses. (2) The timeline is from eternity (vv 1-2), future (vv 3-11) and then present (vv 12-end). (3) It is a favorite psalm for funerals, as attested by Spurgeon. How do you characterize your life? What meaning does your life have? What difference have you made? Does your today and tomorrow. Psalm 90 has a perfect answer for viewing life past, present and future. Seek His Permanent Dwelling 1 Lord, you have been our dwelling place throughout all generations. 2 Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God. The most famous golfer today is Tiger Woods, who became the youngest-ever winner of the U.S. Amateur Championship, at age 18.

He's cashed for more than $1 billion, according to Forbes. Tiger was so great everybody thought he would break Jack Nicklaus' record of 18 majors but he stopped at 15 in 2008.

The answer is only five- three are from David (Ps 17:1. 86:1, 142:1), one is from Moses (Ps 90:1) and one ""a prayer of the afflicted"" (Ps 102:1), so this is a prayer, a psalm and a poem - in that order. How often does this noun ""prayer"" appear in Moses' story or account? The answer is none until Psalm 90. The verb form occurs in Moses' account as many as four times - three times to pray for the people (Num 11:2, 21:7, Deut 9:26) and none for David. Rabbinic tradition assigns the ten following Psalms, Psalms 91-100 to Moses. Other Psalms written by Moses are also found in Exodus 15, and in Deuteronomy 32. Psalms 90-106 is Book IV of Psalms and Book IV begins with a powerful and praiseworthy prayer. Of all the 150 psalms in the Bible, only Psalm 90 begins with the respectful ""Lord"" (adonai) address. That itself makes it a direct, distinctive and distinguished prayer. Adonai means the Master and more than just the Maker, the Commander, chief and controller of your life and not just the Creator, chum or companion of your life and not just the Creator, Big Boss first before Best friend."
1 Timothy 2:1-7,"('Paul', 'Timothy')",Independent/Bible," THE MINISTER OF GOD (1 TIMOTHY 2:1-7) Many have asked me, ""How did you come to serve in this church?"" A month before I arrived in Hong Kong in August 2008, I met Rev. Patrick So for the first time in Los Angeles. I told him I was headed to Hong Kong to teach in a local seminary and he said to look for him in Hong Kong. Since we lived nearby at that time, we attended his church. Rev. So invited me to help in fellowship, but I politely declined because the attendance at the last church for the last ten years where I was the pastor was around 80 on a good day. I cannot imagine leading or supporting 300- to 500-strong fellowship with more people than a church. Two year later with more understanding of the church task at hand, tears rolled down my eyes one Sunday worship morning as I hear of more coworkers resignation, fired or burn-out. The next week by God's providence I met Rev. So at the lobby, so I quickly seized the opportunity and asked him, ""I do not want to work with fellowship groups, but I would like to work with incoming pastors."" It was an unheard of ministry and position at that time. Knowing Rev. So, the answer was ""Done! We have a big need."" Mentoring incoming coworkers is still my number one passion at church, , not preaching or leadership. Young or incoming coworkers are in a precarious position. Those who do not make it leave before three years and eight months are up. Many of them cannot afford to fail because the average graduate is in the 40s. More often that not, they are no closer to the five ""dao"" the church requires. In America more than 1,700 pastors leave the ministry every month due to moral failure, financial need, physical health, marital problems, work conflict and emotional issues such as burnout, discouragement , anger, loneliness and compulsion. http://www.churchleaders.com/pastors/pastor-articles/161343-tim_peters_10_common_reasons_pastors_quit_too_soon.html Paul's relationship with the young minister, his star protégé and favorite coworker can be best characterized as a father-son relationship. Paul affectionately called Timothy as son Timothy (1 Tim 1:18), my son (2 Tim 2:1), my own son in the faith (1 Tim 1:2), my beloved son (1 Cor 4:17) and my dearly beloved son (2 Tim 1:2), calling him son more times than calling Titus (Titus 1:4) and Philemon (Philem 10). What challenges, risks await a young person in ministry or service? What advice would you give to a close friend or a new graduate? How would you hope to teach or train him or her? Why should be involved in blessing and bringing up the next generation of kingdom workers? Pray for All (vv 1-2) 1 I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people-- 2 for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.

John 9:28-42,"('Nicodemus', 'Arimathea')",Independent/Bible," OPEN SECRET (JOHN 19:38-42) Fourth century church theologian Augustine told of a Victorinus (a renowned philosopher and teacher in Rome; who had even been honored with a statue in the Roman forum) who was converted to Christianity in his old age. He came to Simplicius, one eminent at the time for his piety), whispering in his ear softly, these words: ""I am a Christian."" The godly man answered, ""I will not believe it, nor count thee so, till I see you among the Christians in the church."" Victorinus laughed and said, ""Cannot I be such, unless I openly proclaim it, and let the world know the same?"" On another occasion, he says, ""Is it the walls of a church, then, that make people Christians?"" This he said for fear, being yet a young convert, though an old man. A while after, when he was confirmed in the faith, he changed his note, and came to Simplicius saying, ""Let us go to the church, I will in no wise earnest be a Christian."" When Victorinus was baptized, the presbyters of the church told him that he could make the profession privately, because of his age and dignity but he chose to do it openly, saying, ""I had openly professed rhetoric, which was not a matter of salvation, and should I be afraid to own the word of God in the congregation of the faithful?"" (The Book of Illustrations, Henry George Slater, page 98). When Jesus was crucified, all the disciples forsook him, and fled (Matt 26:56, Mark 14:50). In Luke's version the women stood helplessly from a distance watching the events unfolding (Luke 23:49, Mark 15:40, Matt 27:55). Everyone feared for the worst for Jesus' body. But a surprising and spectacular thing happened. Two unlikely men the disciples hardly knew obtained the body of Jesus and buried Jesus in the garden. The ladies followed the men, and saw the tomb and how His body was laid. They then returned and prepared spices and perfumes. (Luke 23:55-56) What kind of person are you when faced with adversity or adversaries? How have you demonstrated your faithfulness to God and others? Why is it important for us to be unashamed of the Lord and the gospel? Conjure the Courage (The Person, with your mouth) 38 Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jewish leaders. With Pilate's permission, he came and took the body away. Two young men came to New York City from the country on a visit. They went to the same boarding-house to stay and took a room together. Well, when they came to go to bed each felt ashamed to go down on his knees before his companion first. So they sat watching each other. In fact, to express the situation in one word, they were both cowards--yes, cowards! But at last one of them mustered up a little courage, and with burning blushes, as if he was about to do something wrong and wicked, he sunk down on his knees to say his prayers. As soon as the second saw that, he also knelt. And then, after they had said their prayers, each waited for the other to get up. When they did manage to get up one said to the other: ""I really am glad to see that you knelt; I was afraid of you."" ""Well,"" said the other, ""and I was afraid of you."""
"Jeremiah 23:5-6, Romans 3:23","(""God's Name"", ""God's Names"", 'Relationship With God', 'God Our Righteousness')",Assembly Of God," When we read the Bible, we normally read an English translation of Hebrew from the Old Testament and a similar translation of Greek from the New Testament. What we don't realize perhaps is that words from one language do not always translate easily into the other language. I am sure the Bible translators struggle with this. That is why there are so many English versions of the Bible - some to make it easy for people to understand its major focus and others to more accurately show the fine points of what is written. Most people today think God's name is ""God"". They don't realize that God's name is expressed many ways in the Hebrew Scriptures (our Old Testament). What a rich treasure you find when you start looking at these! The Bible reveals many different variations of God's name to reveal more to us about who He is! [To complete this introduction, I recommend a chart by Rose Publishing that shows 10 of the many different names used for God. They all reveal something more about Him. I used it briefly to simply introduce this sermon to those who may be unaware of the different names God has used to reveal Himself.] Now take a look at the handout [showing ""Yahweh-Tsidkenu: The Lord Our Righteousness"", with Jeremiah 23:5-6 written out in Modern English Version and Names-Of-God Bible version]. Here we have a couple sets of verses, one of which is translated fully into modern English, but the second retains the Hebrew versions of the names for God. The name that is emphasized here is a very important name, because it tells us what God had in mind in terms of our relationship with Him since ""all have sinned and are far away from God's saving presence."" (Romans 3:23) We are not naturally ""right with God"" any more. When God created the first man and woman, they were able to enjoy God to the fullest every day. Just like the old song says, they walked with Him, and they talked with Him and, yes, He told them they were his own. But that didn't last for long. Our ancestors in the Garden of Eden disobeyed God the first time. We were not designed to be able to deal with sin on our own - so God had forbidden Adam and Eve from eating from the one tree that would reveal both good and evil to them. But Adam and Eve distrusted God that He was being honest with them. Instead, they were led to trust in themselves as knowing better than God what was good for them to experience. Because they disobeyed, we now just don't naturally have that great relationship with God anymore. Instead, still have a tendency toward sin, with no way in ourselves to really deal with it. But God has a way to deal with it. This is where God as Yahweh-Tsidkenu, ""The Lord Our Righteousness"", comes in. To be more specific, God said He would raise up a righteous Branch for David, actually out of David's family. You all know who that is - that's Jesus! Jesus is Jehovah-Tsidkenu, ""The Lord Our Righteousness"". If you want to be right with God, you cannot do it on your own. It takes God giving us His own righteousness in order for us to be righteous ourselves. That righteousness can only come from Jesus."
Ecclesiastes 1:1-18,"('Ecclesiastes', 'Solomon')",Independent/Bible," THE CHIEF PURPOSE OF LIFE (ECCLESIASTES 1) When I told my wife I would be preaching from the book of Ecclesiastes she revealed to me for the first time that she attempted to do a study guide for the book but gave up after trying! The book is definitely not for easy digging, decoding or digesting. Three days ago she started working on the study guide. There is a book with the title, ""Every Time I Find the Meaning of Life, They Change it."" Ecclesiastes is a universal book and masterwork with primal themes. God is Elohim (v 13) not Israel's Yahweh. It is meant for Adam (v 3), generation before and after (v 4) and the sons of Adam (v 11), everyone. The word ""all"" occurs nine times in chapter one. Augustine referred to Ecclesiastes as, ""Setting forth the vanity of this life, only that we may desire that life wherein, instead of vanity beneath the sun, there is truth (and eternal joy) under Him who made the sun!"" The purpose of Ecclesiastes, according to biblehub.com, is ""to spare future generations the suffering and misery of seeking after foolish, meaningless, materialistic emptiness, and to offer wisdom by discovering truth in seeking after God."" Kenneth D. Boa says, ""The purpose of Ecclesiastes is to reveal the bankruptcy of human wisdom and the need for God's revelation."" The introductory phrase ""the words of"" is authoritative in the grand tradition of prophets Nehemiah (1:10), Jeremiah (1:1) and Hosea (1:1). The author introduces himself as a preacher, the son of David and king in Jerusalem (Eccl 1:1). The writer is a poet, a philosopher and a preacher. The book title in Hebrew means preacher, convener or host. In chapter one he measured man from the biological, historical and philosophical viewpoint- three subjects of which I am not an expert. The vital questions in life are simple and basic: Who am I? Why am I here? Why do I exist? What is truth? What do I believe? What is my purpose in life? Where are we heading?

Everything is meaningless."" 3 What do people gain from all their labors at which they toil under the sun? 4 Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever. 5 The sun rises and the sun sets, and hurries back to where it rises. 6 The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes, ever returning on its course. 7 All streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place the streams come from, there they return again. 8 All things are wearisome, more than one can say. The eye never has enough of seeing, nor the ear its fill of hearing. Song Charlie Brown once asked himself sitting on the ground in a vast field at night, ""Life sure is strange. And they say we only come this way once. What did I come this way for?"" The noun ""vanity"" breaks a lot of records in verse 2, repeating as many as five times in one verse - one of the most repeated word in a verse, and the longer phrase and theme ""vanity of vanities, all is vanity"" (v 2) is found in two places only and nowhere else, in the introductory chapter and the last chapter of the book (12:8),. Vanity does not mean nothing, as in Hinduism and Buddhism; it is ""is not"" rather than ""nothing"":"
Genesis 24:1-27,"('Abraham', 'Eliezer')",Independent/Bible," LOYALTY IS A VIRTUE (GENESIS 24:1-27) Once a domestic servant came to his master in great anger and told him, ""Look, I am not going to serve you any longer as you do not have any faith in me though I am serving you so loyally for the past several years."" Master: ""What is the matter? I have faith in you, that is why I have given all the keys of the house including those of the safe, to you."" Servant: ""No, you do not have faith in me, I am sure."" Master: ""How do you say that?"" Servant: ""I tried all the keys and not one fits the safe."" Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the last chapter (Gen 23:19) and now he was old, and well stricken in age, 14o years old - 1oo when Isaac was born (Genesis 21:5) and 140 when Isaac was married (Genesis 25:20), so Isaac was 40 years old. His son Isaac was not married and had emotional problems with the death of his mother (Gen 24:67). What kind of person are you at your job? What kind of relationship do you have with your employer, superior or colleagues? How can you glorify God at work? Why is work not merely work but a test of our worth, walk and witness? Be Dutiful and Dependable 1 Abraham was now old and well advanced in years, and the Lord had blessed him in every way. 2 He said to the chief servant in his household, the one in charge of all that he had, ""Put your hand under my thigh. 3 I want you to swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am living, 4 but will go to my country and my own relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac."" 5 The servant asked him, ""What if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from?"" 6 ""Make sure that you do not take my son back there,"" Abraham said. 7 ""The Lord, the God of heaven, who brought me out of my father's household and my native land and who spoke to me and promised me on oath, saying, 'To your offspring I will give this land' -- he will send his angel before you so that you can get a wife for my son from there. 8 If the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you will be released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there."" Research from a Institute of Leadership & Management study of over 1,000 employees found that few employees are motivated to work harder by bonuses. The most important motivators were: 59% felt enjoyment of the job was the most important motivator 49% how much they are paid. 42% getting on with colleagues was the best motivator. 22% being treated fairly by their managers. 22% autonomy: how much control they have over their work. Only 13% of employees said that bonuses motivated them to work harder. What brings employees down, according to another survey? For employees who feel somewhat or not at all appreciated, not being recognized for the work they do was the top reason cited by nearly half (48 percent) as something that makes them not feel appreciated at work. In fact, not being recognized for work done is cited nearly twice as much as receiving criticism (26 percent) and heavy workload (25 percent), and more than twice as much as poor work-life balance (23 percent) and someone taking credit for the work they did (22 percent)."
Romans 8:1-11,"('Paul', 'Romans', 'Book Of Romans')",Independent/Bible," LIFE IN THE SPIRIT (ROMANS 8:1-11) A Chinese student at a local university asked me to explain the Trinity, so I did my best at a subject no one passes. I began by telling him that Father plus Son plus Spirit do not mean three Gods, but that God is three in one. Adding 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, but multiplying 1 three times is also 1, so Trinity is not 1+1+1 but 1 x 1 x 1+ 1, three Persons in one. At this he was taken by surprise. He said, The Spirit is a person. I answered, ""Yes, the Spirit is a person, not a force or a thing."" He cannot be controlled, cornered or converted. The Holy Spirit (Matt 12:31), also known as Spirit of God (Matt 3:16), the Spirit of your Father (Matt 10:20), the Spirit of the Lord (Luke 4:18) and the Spirit of Christ (Rom 8:9). The Father is the Sender, Christ is the Savior, and the Spirit is the Sanctifier. He is the eternal Spirit (Heb 9:14), the Spirit of grace (Heb 10:29), the Spirit of glory (1 Peter 4:14), the Spirit of life (Rev 11:11) and Spirit of truth (John 14:17, 15:26, 16:13). In Him there is power (Rom 15:13, 19), sanctification or holiness (Rom 15:16), love (Rom 15:30), liberty (2 Cor 3:17), communion (2 Cor 13:14), fruit (Gal 5:22) and joy (1 Thess 1:6-7). The person of the ""Spirit"" occurs 21 times in the chapter, the most for a chapter in the Bible. Who is the Spirit? How is He active in us? Why is the Spirit an unmistakable part of our lives? Let Go the Slavish Past 1 Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, 2 because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death. 3 For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in the flesh, 4 in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. 5 Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. 6 The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace. 7 The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so. An Indian and a white man were brought under deep conviction of sin by the same sermon. The Indian was immediately led to rejoice in pardoning mercy. The white man was in distress for a long time, almost to despair. But at last he was brought to a joyous sense of sins forgiven. Sometime after, while meeting his Indian brother, the white man said to him, ""How is it that I should be so long under conviction, when you found peace at once?"" ""Oh, brother,"" replied the Indian, ""I will tell you. There comes along a rich prince. He proposes to give you a new coat; you look at your coat and say, 'I don't know; my coat looks pretty good; it will do a little longer.' He then offered me a new coat. I look at my old blanket; I say, 'This is good for nothing,' and accept the beautiful new garment. Just so, brother, you try to keep your own righteousness. You won't give it up; but I, poor Indian, could see that I had none, so I was glad at once to receive the righteousness of God--the Lord Jesus Christ."" (Illustrations of Bible Truths # 714)"
Ecclesiastes 1:1-25,"('Ecclesiastes', 'Solomon')",Independent/Bible," I AM NOT THE GREATEST (ECCLESIASTES 2) Ecclesiastes begins with a resounding five-fold repetition of the word ""vanity"" in one verse, a literary abnormality even in repetition-heavy Jewish literature: Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity (Eccl 1:2). Instead of profit (1:3), permanence (1:9) and progress, there is pain, pessimism and powerlessness, as I experienced when my wife passed away on May 22, 2016, two weeks before this message. In chapter one we looked at how he constructed his argument by presenting man, the person, study him biologically, historically and philosophically, and contrasted him with mother nature, father time, and philosopher kings (Plato). From man the person we study man and his potential. What are his advantages, advances and adversities? What makes him great, gifted and good? We ask three questions: Who are you - your being? What have you done? Your behaving? What is your future? - your becoming You Need a Humble Attitude, not a Haughty Spirit (Your Greatness) 1 I said to myself, ""Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good."" But that also proved to be meaningless. 2 ""Laughter,"" I said, ""is madness. And what does pleasure accomplish?"" 3 I tried cheering myself with wine, and embracing folly--my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was good for people to do under the heavens during the few days of their lives. 4 I undertook great projects: I built houses for myself and planted vineyards. 5 I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them. 6 I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees. 7 I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me. 8 I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired male and female singers, and a harem as well--the delights of a man's heart. 9 I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with me. 10 I denied myself nothing my eyes desired; I refused my heart no pleasure. My heart took delight in all my labor, and this was the reward for all my toil. A King was going to his palace after his rounds in the city when he met a beggar. He asked the beggar, ""What would you like?"" The beggar laughed and said, ""You are asking me as though you can fulfill my desire!"" The king was offended. He said, ""Of course I can fulfil your desire. What is it? Just tell me."" And the beggar said, ""Think twice before you promise anything."" ""I will fulfill anything you ask. I am a powerful king, what can you possibly desire that I can not give to you?"" The beggar said, ""It is a very simple desire. You see this begging bowl? Can you fill it with something?"" The king said, ""Of course!"" He called his vizier and told him, ""Fill this man's begging bowl with money."" The vizier went and got some money and poured it into the bowl, and it disappeared. And he poured more and more, and the moment he would pour it, it would disappear. And the begging bowl remained always empty."
Ecclesiastes 3:1-21,"('Ecclesiastes', 'Solomon')",Independent/Bible," THE TIME OF OUR LIVES (ECCLESIASTES 3) Two weeks ago, eight days after my wife's passing away, I went by myself to Repulse Bay to recapture or reshoot the same picture of my wife sitting on a railing. It did not work out as the background is not the same; neither is the railing, the tree, the building, the V fingers raised and time of day. Ecc 1 Ecc 2 Ecc 3 The Profit The Pride The Purpose Biological Man Historical Man Philosophical Man His Greatness His Giftedness His Goodness What Was Done What Man Did What God Will Do What is your purpose in life? What path do you plan to take? What progress have you made? What priorities are foremost to you? Determine Your Purpose There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens: 2 a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot, 3 a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build, 4 a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance, 5 a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing, 6 a time to search and a time to give up, a time to keep and a time to throw away, 7 a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak, 8 a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace. 9 What do workers gain from their toil? 10 I have seen the burden God has laid on the human race. William Arthur Ward says, ""The adventure of life is to learn. The purpose of life is to grow. The nature of life is to change. The challenge of life is to overcome. The essence of life is to care. The opportunity of life is to serve. The secret of life is to dare. The spice of life is to befriend. The beauty of life is to give. The joy of life is to love."" The first verse determines the message of chapter three. The Hebrew rendition is ""To all (there is) a season and a time to all purpose under heaven."" To all does not limit the scope and subject to all things. It could be people or events. Season (v 1) or ""zeman"" is different from time (eth). Season (zeman) is still used in many countries such as Indonesia, Turkey and the Middle East. It refers to a past era, an age in history, or a certain period of time. Time, however, is not necessarily present time, but ""seasons"" (Ex 18:22) or ""due season"" (Deut 11:14). The contrast could be past and present, former versus future, older and ongoing. The noun ""purpose"" is translated outside of Ecclesiastes as delight (1 Sam 15:22), desire (1 Sam 18:25) and pleasure (Job 21:21). There is order, objective, and outlook to all things. Hence it is a good thing. Not only is it purposeful, but positive and pleasing. The translation of ""purpose"" is only in this book and not the other 32 instances outside the book. In the book it is translated as purpose (Eccl 3:1), pleasure (Eccl 5:4) and acceptable (Eccl 12:10). It is antithesis and contrast to chance, coincidence and chaos. It's been said, ""Everything happens for a purpose."" Time is the occasion, but purpose is the opportunity."
Psalms 4:1-15,"('David', 'Psalms')",Independent/Bible," ALL FOR ONE, ONE FOR ALL (ECCLESIASTES 4) Chapter four has a pointed, popular but painful phrase in the book - vexation of spirit. There are three ""vexation of spirit"" occurs seven times in the Bible, thrice in chapter four, in verses 4, 6, and 16, the most in any chapter of the book or the Bible. Spirit is more than wind in Hebrew, which is the normal translation nowadays besides KJV. The more popular translations include Spirit or spirit (232x), wind (92x), and breath (27x). Wind is too specific as compared to spirit, which is non-object, physical or mobile. Vexation is taken from the root raah, translated mostly as feed (75x), shepherd (63x), pastor (8x), herdmen (7x) in KJV. So the whole phrase could mean eating, consuming or digesting spirit, air or breath. It can mean endless, elusive, erratic, empty and exasperating. It could mean discouragement, desolation or deficiency. Afflicted vv 1-6 Alone vv 7-12 Aging vv 13-16 Be Sensitive to Sufferers 1 Again I looked and saw all the oppression that was taking place under the sun: I saw the tears of the oppressed-- and they have no comforter; power was on the side of their oppressors-- and they have no comforter. 2 And I declared that the dead, who had already died, are happier than the living, who are still alive. 3 But better than both is the one who has never been born, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun. 4 And I saw that all toil and all achievement spring from one person's envy of another. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. 5 Fools fold their hands and ruin themselves. 6 Better one handful with tranquility than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind.　 My wife and I arrived in Hong Kong on Aug 18, 2008. After my wife passed away on May 22, 2016, Rev. So invited me for holiday dinner (July 1, 2016). I asked him, ""How am I different from other coworkers whose wives passed away?"" He said, ""Different. You do not have any relatives in Hong Kong."" Other coworkers can go home to their parents' place for dinner. My relatives were siblings on my wife's side - two sisters in Hong Kong, and we had no children. So I know what is like to be alone and abandoned in Hong Kong, even though I do have a brother in Malaysia, a sister in USA and my mother in Singapore. Truth to be told, there are worse. There is at least three. Preach to the suffering and you will never lack a congregation. There is a broken heart in every pew. British pastor Joseph Parker There are at least five traditional groups in society that suffer oppression or are vulnerable to oppression: the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, the poor (Zech 7:10) and the hireling (Mal 3:5). There are seven types of people up to verse 6: the fool strong. The verb ""see"" is a progression (vv 1, 3). The author first ""saw"" all the ""oppressions"" (Eccl 4:1), the tears (v 1), power (v 1), no comforter (v 1), then the ""evil work"" (v 3). The word ""oppression"" is a verb and not a noun, an act and no longer a discussion. The verb occurs merely five times in the Bible, of which verse 2 is its second occurrence in the Bible. The first occurrence is in Job 35:9, where the oppressed ""cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty."" The verb is derived from another verb that is translated as deceive (Lev 6:2), defraud (Lev 19:13), wrong (1 Chron 16:21), drinketh up (Job 40:23), doeth violence (Prov 28:17), so it is an issue of might, money and morality. Are there worse things than suffer oppressions? What can be worse than oppression? Of course, there are worse things than wicked oppression, of which the first is without comfort. Twice the verse says ""they have no comforter,"" which is translated as ease (Isa 1:24), meaning no support, calm, consolation, care, Of course, there is something worse than wicked oppression, that is, without comfort, but crying, cruelty and coldness and casualness."
2 Timothy 2:3,"('Sheep', 'Soldiers')",Pentecostal," WE ARE AT WAR 2Ti 2:3 Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. 2Ti 2:4 No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. There are several different aspects of God's dealings with church. The most familiar is that of the family of God. We are all related by the blood of Jesus and held together by our love for God our Father and for each other. Then he calls the church his building, his Temple, his husbandry which means farmland. Then there's the relationship of the shepherd with his sheep. Jesus is the chief Shepherd and we are his sheep. Then He called the church His workmanship created in Christ Jesus: (Eph 2:10) which means we are the works of his hands like a Potter's vessel is the work of The Potter's hands. We are his Masterpiece and like the artist takes pleasure in what he creates we were created for his pleasure. All of these are different aspects of our relationship with our heavenly father and in every different facet we will experience God's work in and through our lives in different ways. So when I speak to you I can address you as God's flock his sheep. Or I can address you as his building his Temple His dwelling place. or as his handiwork, his masterpiece. Or I might address you as his husbandry his Farmland where he sows His good seed and produces good fruit, or I might even call you his Vineyard [as Jesus said I am the vine and you are the branches] And all of these are wonderful aspects and facets of our relationship with the Lord, but there's one aspect of our relationship that I have to deal with today"" and that is [ the army of God] The Bible calls God a man of war (Ex 15:3 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.) The Bible calls Jesus the captain of our salvation. (Heb 2:10 To make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. The Bible shows Gods dealings with the children of Israel who had been in slavery for 400 years: They didn't know anything about fighting and warfare because they were slaves and farmers and they farmed Pharaohs land and they took care of his animals and built his buildings but they didn't even know how to hold a sword (yet they became the greatest army in the world). Israel never was and never has been the biggest or strongest nation, but God is in her midst and got has fought with Israel and God has fought for Israel. Let me tell you something ( whatever happens in this world let the church stand with Israel). In the Bible Israel was God's Army; today the church is God's Army While we enjoy and relish all the other aspects of our relationship with God we need to know that we are in an hour when The Church Must once again become the army of God. AS IN Ezekiel 37 The Church Must rise up as a mighty Army filled with the spirit AND the mighty power of God. We must understand that we may be sheep but these sheep are also soldiers. Remember the captain of this Army (the Lamb of God) is also the lion of the tribe of Judah."

Baby: Stay strong! The school year is almost over! Don't start what you cannot finish. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith (2 Tim 4:7) Are you satisfied with what you have? What kind of ending are you expecting - poor, plain or pleasant? How do you prepare for a good or happy ending? What do you have to add or subtract midway to get to the good or happy ending? Be Mourners and Ministers 1 A good name is better than fine perfume, and the day of death better than the day of birth. 2 It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, for death is the destiny of everyone; the living should take this to heart. 3 Frustration is better than laughter, because a sad face is good for the heart. 4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure. 5 It is better to heed the rebuke of a wise person than to listen to the song of fools. 6 Like the crackling of thorns under the pot, so is the laughter of fools. This too is meaningless. 7 Extortion turns a wise person into a fool, and a bribe corrupts the heart. Doris' nephew, her eldest sister's son Joshua, had a choice and decision to make at Doris' loss, to go for wedding in USA or fly all the way to Hong Kong for aunt Doris' memorial service. His parents were already returned to Hong Kong at that time. He shared: ""So the wedding was some college friends from my college fellowship and it was in Alaska. I had already bought my plane tickets and planned some living arrangements with some people. But I felt that it was better to go to the memorial service and spend time with our family. And to support and encourage you and my mom and her sisters. I had to cancel my flight to Alaska. I got some of the money back but lost some of the change fee. I don't remember but i think a few hundred. I was encouraged to see all the support for our family and all the different people that she touched with her life. I also was blessed with seeing how the service was Christ centered and reminded us that we are not yet home. Hmm I helped to support the family and went in the hearse with Auntie Doris."" Verses 1 and 2 are linked by the identical opening word - ""better."" There is no greater good in any chapter of the Bible than chapter seven, which has 14 occurrences, and verse three has ""good"" in the verb form, making it 15. What is different from this ""good/better"" (v 1) than the rest of the book and Bible is that it begins a chapter and is the first word of a chapter in the Bible for the first time, a literary device common to Solomon's writing repeated two other times in Proverbs (Prov 17:1, 19:1).

1 Samuel 25:36-38,"('Wisdom', 'Arrogance')",Baptist," ""Abigail came to Nabal, and behold, he was holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk. So she told him nothing at all until the morning light. In the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone. And about ten days later the LORD struck Nabal, and he died."" Did you ever wonder how a particular woman came to be married to a certain man? It is said that opposites attract, but, sometimes the difference is so great that you wonder how they ever became a couple. That could have been the situation when you saw Nabal and Abigail. Perhaps they were a good-looking couple, but they were certainly different when it came to temperament and to their interactions with the world about them. In economic terms, Nabal must have looked like a good catch. His wealth was about all that made him attractive. I suggest that it is significant that the writer introduces this man by first taking note of his wealth. The writer introduces the man by observing, ""There was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel. The man was very rich; he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats"" [1 SAMUEL 25:2]. Only after telling us of his riches does the writer tell us his name. Wealth was how Nabal chose to define his life. His possessions preceded his person; Nabal lived to defend his property. Then, he died following an orgy that would rival the feast of any oriental king intent on boasting of his wealth. Jesus told a parable concerning how a person can define life by the wealth possessed. Jesus said, ""The land of a rich man produced plentifully, and he thought to himself, 'What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?' And he said, 'I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul, ""Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.""' But God said to him, 'Fool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?' So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God"" [LUKE 12:16-21]. The Master easily could have had this man in view when He told that parable. INSULTING A FUTURE KING -- How did David, a poor shepherd when we first meet him, become an outlaw?

Now, we see him as a bandit, always one step ahead of a vengeful king.

David was appointed by Samuel to be the King of Israel [see 1 SAMUEL 16:1-13]; Samuel took this action at God's direction. Saul was driven by jealousy to attempt to kill David. It did not matter to the enraged king that David repeatedly bested the enemies of the land and that he was loyal to Saul--Saul would not tolerate the thought that the women of Israel praised David more highly than they praised him [see 1 SAMUEL 18:8, 9]!"

It did not matter to the enraged king that David repeatedly bested the enemies of the land and that he was loyal to Saul--Saul would not tolerate the thought that the women of Israel praised David more highly than they praised him [see 1 SAMUEL 18:8, 9]!"
Romans 11:33-36,"('Glory To God', 'Solas Of Reformation')",Wesleyan," He was a man who couldn't keep a job. He was a church organist and composer and while he was a great organist the pieces that he composed himself were often considered too showy to be played in church, and so eventually the church would grumble and he would move on. So glad churches today don't grumble about music. And he was no doubt forgotten by the churches he had worked for but certainly not forgotten by history. His name was Johann Sebastian Bach, maybe you recognize it. Once when the pastor of one church was relaying the concerns of the congregation Bach responded by saying: ""The main purpose of my music is to glorify God. Some people do this with music that is simple. I haven't chosen to use a simple style, but my music comes from my heart as a humble offering to God. This honours God no matter what musical style I use."" The main purpose of my music is to glorify God. Can we say that about what we do? Here is a sample of one of Bach's compositions, and notice down here at the you'll see Soli Deo Gloria - For the Glory of God Alone. We are told when Bach began to write a new song that he wrote the initials JJ at the top of the page, which stood for ""Jesu Juva"" Latin for ""Jesus Help Me"" and when he finished the work he wrote For the Glory of God Alone. And he wasn't alone, both Handel and Graupner signed their work with Soli Deo Gloria to signify that their music was produced for the sake of glorifying God. This is our fifth and final week of our Old Foundation series and through the month of January we've been looking at the ""Five Solas"" of the Protestant Reformation. Now for those who are thinking, ""I wonder what a protestant reformation is?"" Don't feel bad, you probably are in the majority of folks. Often people think that there has always been a broad range of Christians denominations, but not so. For the first thousand years that the church existed there was really just ""The Church"". And that ended in 1054 with what was known as the ""Great Schism"" and the church separated into the Catholic Church to the west and the Orthodox Church to the east. And then for the next five hundred years there were two main Christian groups. That two-church model ended 500 years ago. In 1517 a Catholic priest and theologian by the name of Martin Luther challenged the leadership of the Catholic church on a number of issues where he felt the church had drifted into error. He didn't get up one morning and think ""By golly today is the day that I completely reshape what Christianity looks like."" He was simply seeking to bring the Catholic church in line with the scriptures. Instead he was ultimately excommunicated by the church and the Lutheran church was born, and since then there have been more Protestant churches started then you can shake the proverbial stick at. But what Luther shared with the reformers who would come after him, men like Calivn and Zwingli was a common foundation, what are often referred to as the Five Solas. And that is where we've been parked for the past five weeks."
Revelation 14:6-13,"('Fire', 'Babylon', 'Fear God', 'Everlasting Gospel', 'Fire And Brimstone')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 12/17/16 ? Title: Proclamations of Three Angels (Revelation 14:6-13) Revelation 14:6-13 (KJV) 6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, 7 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. 8 And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. 9 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, 10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: 11 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. 12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. 13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them. Introduction Three angels now appear who have been commissioned by the Lord to deliver three proclamations to the earth. Commentary I. The Proclamation Concerning Belief (vs. 6-7) ""And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people."" John sees an angel that appears in mid-air, or mid heaven. This is the place in the sky where the sun is at its highest (noon), the highest point in the sky. The scene he describes has this angel in the center point of the sky preaching the gospel to the whole world. You can be certain the Antichrist (the Beast) will not lay a hand on this servant of God. His pulpit is beyond the reach of God's enemies. He will herald His message to the Jewish remnant that in turn will carry it throughout the earth. God's message must be spoken. If men are silenced, then angels become vocal. If Satan could slay and silence every human witness of God's truth, then God would see to its proclamation by some other means. It should be noted that the word ""angel"" literally means ""messenger."" When Paul wrote ""But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed"" (Galatians 1:8), he was not stating emphatically that angels do preach the gospel in our present age. But in the Tribulation the wickedness of man and the power of Satan necessitate a change in the divine method. God will then resort to a method he used before Christ came to earth the first time: ""For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast . . ."" (Hebrews 2:2). This angel is the first in a parade of six ""another"" angels mentioned in verses 8-9, 15, and 17-18."
1 Corinthians 2:1-5,"('Abiding In Christ', 'Power Of Word')",Lutheran," How many of you have read ""Hatchet"" by Gary Paulsen? It's a young-adult novel about a boy's quest to survive in the Canadian wilderness after his plane crashes. He's only armed with a hatchet, and yet that's all he needs to survive for over a month before he's rescued. It's a familiar storyline isn't it? Survivors of plane crashes and ship wrecks have to make do with the bare minimum. No matches? No problem. Just strike your hatchet against rock with iron in it and you'll get sparks with which to ignite tinder. No fish hooks? Use your hatchet to sharpen branches into spears. You're only limited in what you can do by your creativity, or so the story goes. What does this have to do with the church in Corinth we've been studying? I thought we've been saying that the Corinthian church was fully equipped, unlike the boy in the novel who only had a hatchet? Yes, the Corinthians were fully equipped spiritually speaking, but how had they become that? Through the seemingly simplistic message of Christ crucified. This is the message that we have received too--a message, however, that we might take for granted because we hear it so often. But without the message of Christ crucified we'd be worse off than a hatchet-less boy lost in the wilderness. Let's come to appreciate again how we are fully equipped for life now and hereafter through the message of Christ crucified. It was a miracle that there was a Christian congregation in Corinth. You may remember from our first sermon in this series how the city of Corinth was considered to be ""sin city"" in Paul's day, much like Las Vegas is today. Just as anything seems to be permissible and even encouraged in Vegas, so it was in Corinth. In fact sexual immorality was promoted at one of the pagan temples. The temple of Aphrodite which stood on a lofty rock overlooking the city was said to have employed 1,000 men and women for the purpose of sleeping with worshippers as a way for them to get closer to the divine. On top of that, Corinth was a well-to-do city. What would the people there need with Jesus? They had it all already--or so they thought. Besides that, Paul came to Corinth from Athens where his message about Jesus had received a lukewarm reception by the intellectuals of that city. And before that he had come from Berea, Thessalonica, and Philippi--all towns he had been run out of for preaching about Jesus. Would his reception be any better in Corinth, which seemed like it could be the city with the toughest audience of them all? Paul even admitted to the Corinthians: ""I came to you in weakness with great fear and trembling"" (1 Corinthians 2:3). Do you feel the way Paul did when you think about witnessing to friends? Sure, the newcomer to Canada might be interested in learning about Jesus because they never had the chance before, but what about the friend whose family stopped going to church a generation ago? What about the science teacher who promotes evolution, or your neighbor, the bank rep who seems to have it all? What about the musician whose goal it is to make it big? Do you get nervous when you think about telling people like that about Jesus? I do because I doubt that they will believe what I have to say or even care to listen. So I hesitate, telling myself that I'm waiting for a more ""appropriate"" time. Then I search for eloquent words and irrefutable arguments to lay before them. But compare that with Paul's approach. He told the Corinthians, ""When I came to you, I did not come with eloquence or human wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God. 2 For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified"" (1 Corinthians 2:1, 2)."
Mark 7:24-30,"('Abortion', 'Respect Life', 'Human Dignity')",Catholic," Thursday of Fifth Week in Course Joy of the Gospel This Gospel is one for the thoughtless atheist to seize and wring out for every drop of abuse of the Catholic truth. It looks on the surface like Jesus sinning. He is verbally abusing this poor pagan woman, whose only offense is to ask for Christ's help. But, of course, Jesus could not sin. So what's the explanation? We know from studying post-exilic Judaism that by the first century, the Jewish leaders had turned away from the original vision God had for the descendants of Abraham. God wanted the Temple to be a place that attracted people from all over the world to orthodoxy, to right worship, right living, and right understanding. First-century Judaism was inward-looking, treating people like this woman as less than human, and even calling them ""dogs."" So Jesus is with good humor taunting this poor pagan, ""shouldn't I be taking care of the Jews exclusively?"" The mother answers also in good humor, ""yes, Lord, but let me have the scraps that fall from the table."" Jesus affirmed her faith and her human dignity by driving out the evil that afflicted her daughter. All human beings deserve to be treated with compassion and dignity. All are welcome to the healing power of Christ's presence, both then in His mortal body, and now, in His sacramental power. The pope has been admonishing us with respect to treating the poor with dignity, and he continues: 'Doubly poor are those women who endure situations of exclusion, mistreatment and violence, since they are frequently less able to defend their rights. Even so, we constantly witness among them impressive examples of daily heroism in defending and protecting their vulnerable families. 'Among the vulnerable for whom the Church wishes to care with particular love and concern are unborn children, the most defenceless and innocent among us. Nowadays efforts are made to deny them their human dignity and to do with them whatever one pleases, taking their lives and passing laws preventing anyone from standing in the way of this. Frequently, as a way of ridiculing the Church's effort to defend their lives, attempts are made to present [the Church's] position as ideological, obscurantist and conservative. Yet this defence of unborn life is closely linked to the defence of each and every other human right. It involves the conviction that a human being is always sacred and inviolable, in any situation and at every stage of development. Human beings are ends in themselves and never a means of resolving other problems. Once this conviction disappears, so do solid and lasting foundations for the defence of human rights, which would always be subject to the passing whims of the powers that be. Reason alone is sufficient to recognize the inviolable value of each single human life, but if we also look at the issue from the standpoint of faith, ""every violation of the personal dignity of the human being cries out [for] vengeance to God and is an offence against the creator of the individual""."
Matthew 24:31-46,"('Millennium', 'Sheep And Goats')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," The Sheep Nations Matthew 24:31-46 31 And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. 32""Now learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near. 33So you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near--at the doors! 34Assuredly, I say to you, this generation will by no means pass away till all these things take place. 35Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away. 36""But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only. 37But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. 38For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, 39and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. 40Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left. 41Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left. 42Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming. 43But know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into. 44Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. 45""Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his master made ruler over his household, to give them food in due season? 46Blessed is that servant whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing. Today's passage is often misused by preachers and Bible teachers. They say it refers to the rapture. A careful look at the passage shows that's wrong! Misuse of this important passage leads to doctrinal errors that affect the views concerning the end of this age. A correct understanding of Matthew 24:31-46 gives us answers to some of the most interesting questions as we approach the time of the Lord's Coming. Some of the things that I will try to answer in this sermon are: 1. When does the judgment take place? 2. Who are the sheep and the goats? 3. What does the outcome of this judgment show us? 4. What comes after this event? Look again at Matthew 24:31 And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. This passage does not describe the rapture of the church. I does not describe the great White Throne Judgment. It refers to the second coming of Jesus at the end of the tribulation. The judgment of the sheep and goats takes place at the end of the 7 years of tribulation. It determines who will be alive on earth and will be allowed to enter the 1,000 year millennium. After the 7 years of tribulation end Jesus will establish His 1,000 year reign in Jerusalem. The sheep are the people who will repopulate the earth"
2 Thessalonians 1:3,"('Growth', 'Church Growth', 'Green', 'Spiritual Growth')",United Methodist," Green 1.0 ""We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brethren, as is only fitting, because your faith is greatly enlarged, and the love of each one of you toward one another grows ever greater;"" 2 Thessalonians 1:3 Intro: Aren't you thankful to be part of a great church? This week, I talked with several people about what this church means to them. One person said: ""I love my church because I am loved and supported by my friends. I also feel the power of the Holy Spirit. I don't get emotional but I definitely feel it."" Another person said: ""My church is such a blessing. This is where I found Jesus and got baptized. I have been a member ever since."" One more: ""I love my church because of the preaching, the singing, the praise music, leads me to a holy place in my heart. All of this has helped me to grow in my daily life, not matter what situations I find myself in. The title of today's sermon is ""Green."" When we think about the chronology of Jesus He was born in Bethlehem on Christmas The next week he is two years old and is visited by the Wise men on Epiphany The next week he is thirty and is baptized. And now he is all grown up and begins his public ministry. The word Liturgy (Greek: ?e?t?????a), (eagle yea a) means ""the work of the people"" Or in the church Liturgy are the acts of worship. The colors of worship are White, Red, Purple and Green Green represents growth and is used the season after Epiphany and the season after Pentecost. For the next six weeks we are in the color Green. We are in the color of Jesus early ministry and the color of growth of the early Christian church. Teresa had just been informed that she was being let go from her job. Her superior did not give her any reason. But rather than be fired and have her work record blemished, Teresa choice to resign. Losing a job is tough enough but living with the empty question of why am I being fired was almost more than she could take. For the next several weeks she struggled more and more as she was unable to come to grips with her situation. One weekday she decided to visit the office of her pastor. She had never been in the pastor's office before. The pastor stood and greeted her with a warm and friendly welcome And asked her, ""What brings you into the office today?"" Teresa could not help but feel uncertain as she began to tell him her problem. After several minutes of explanation about her qualifications, her work skills, her faithfulness to her duties, her punctuality and ability to do her job well she continued, ""And while I was there I saw plenty of other employees and managers doing things that I am sure they would not want anyone else to know."" Punching the time card for people who did not come in to work and flirting with people who were married men. And some of my co-workers go to this church. As soon as those words came out of her mouth Teresa paused to see what the reaction of the pastor would be. Had she said too much? Had her frustration been overly critical and negative? The pastor leaned forward in his chair and answered."
Hebrews 5:12-13,"('Growth', 'Church Growth', 'Green', 'Spiritual Growth')",United Methodist," Green 2.0 ""In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God's word all over again. You need milk, not solid food! 13 Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness."" Hebrews 5:12-13 Intro: In case you missed last Sunday or you are new to First Church we are in the second week of a Worship Series titled ""Green."" Last week we talked about how the Christian year has four basic colors: red, white, purple and green. These colors represent the different times in the life of Christ and the church or the different seasons in Christian year. Green is the color for six weeks after Epiphany and will be the color again after Pentecost. ""Green"" is color of growth Green is the time for growth in the church. Green is the time for growth in your own individual spiritual life. Is it possible to measure spiritual growth? If I could summarize the book of Hebrews in one sentence it would be. ""Let us grow spiritually."" Yes, spiritual growth can be measured. That is what our text is talking about today. The writer of Hebrews is able to measure the spiritual growth of the hearers. He says the audience has been believers long enough that they ought to be teachers by now. But instead of making progress they were still spiritually immature and had to be re-taught the elementary truths about God's word all over again. What if there was some type of scale that we could use on Sunday mornings we would line people up and instead of weighing the body weight we could weigh their spiritual weight. Sometimes I wish it were that simple. Because there are times in my own life when I am in the middle of a struggle and I am thinking that my spiritual life is in the dumps. But in reality my spiritual life is growing by leaps and bounds. I just have a difficult time seeing it in the middle of a messy life. And then there will also be times in life when the temptation is to become content with your spiritual life When in reality your spiritual growth has plateaued and reached a state of little or no change. I am convinced that this is one of the most dangerous times in the life of a Christian. And that it is likely true of about one out of five attending church members at any given time. Many churches today are in uncharted territory. They have side by side in the same church lifelong members and totally new seekers. I will preach this same sermon to both the 8:30 crowd and the 10:45 crowd. In these two services there are some very mature believers and there are some brand new believers. Has your spiritual life stalled completely? Have you thought about leaving this church and going somewhere else? Right beside you on the same pew are members who are fired up. Right beside you are people who are passionate about their faith. They are ready to grow deeper in their relationship with Christ. They want to be challenged. They are ready to grow to the next level."
1 Corinthians 2:13,"('Growth', 'Church Growth', 'Green', 'Spiritual Growth')",United Methodist," Green 3.0 ""This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words. 1 Corinthians 2:13 Intro: The past couple of weeks the sermon has centered around one word. That word summarizes what God wants us to do. That word is ""Green"" The color Green represents growth. When you see the color Green think about making new Christians. Anywhere you see the color Green think about growing in our own individual spiritual life. Part of our offerings today go to support the United Methodist Children's home. The featured story for this week is about a young girl by the name of Misty who was placed by social service to the Methodist Children's home. She had deeply rooted anger. She had witness her mother being physically abused by her step-father on a daily basis. See suffered a violent childhood. Needless to say she was not a very happy child. Also she had little respect for authority figures. Misty was verbally aggressive. She challenged everyone who tried to take care of her. She was a danger to herself and to others. But the staff and teachers kept trying help this child who did not want help. Despite all the help she was receiving her life continued to spiral more and more out of control. Misty said, that one day remembered one of the staff saying, ""We will never give up on you no matter how much you try to push us away."" Misty said, it finally hit me. They really do care. That's when not only the emotional healing began but the spiritual healing as well. Misty graduated the program and is now happily married and employed at a pediatric medical assistant. She said, ""I learned that with God anything is possible. If you believe and have faith God will get you through the most difficult times."" All of us have things happen that are painful. Sometimes we have to be helped out of those really bad environments. But no matter what you have gone through or are going through right now. The church and relationship with Jesus Christ will help you overcome and claim victory in your life. You are capable of becoming far more that who you are right now. How do I know what I am capable of if I never get beyond what I am comfortable with? Tap someone on the should and say, ""You are capable of doing more."" ""We can reach the level of spiritual growth God wants for us."" What I have learned about church people and I have been working with church people for long time. That people will say they want to grow. But then they don't want to be changed. The kind of change that comes along with growth. Some people come to church and they already have a list of things they will do and things they will not do. I will come to church and I close my eyes when they say pray. And I will open a hymn book or stand when they say sing. I will look forward and listen to the sermon but you have already set the limit on what part of the word of God you will believe"
Deuteronomy 6:1-9,"('Love', 'Black History')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Teach One, Reach One Why Black History and Your History Is Important Scriptures: Deut. 6:1-9; Proverbs 29:18 The title of my message this morning is ""Teach One, Reach One."" Moses told the Children of Israel ""Now this is the commandment, the statutes and the judgments which the LORD your God has commanded me to teach you, that you might do them in the land where you are going over to possess it, so that you and your son and your grandson might fear the LORD your God, to keep all His statutes and His commandments which I command you, all the days of your life, and that your days may be prolonged."" He told them God had commanded that he teach them the statutes that God had commanded them so that when they entered the Promise Land they would not forget them. Keep this in mind as I will come back to it later. The month of February is designated as Black History month and even though for some it's just another month, there is a reason that we should pause and reflect on the historical contributions blacks have made not only in America but around the world. From a historical perspective, the precursor to Black History Month was created in 1926 in the United States, when historian Carter G. Woodson and the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History announced the second week of February to be ""Negro History Week."" This week was chosen because it coincided with the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln (February 12) and Frederick Douglass (February 14) both of which dates Black communities had celebrated together since the late 19th century. From the event's initial phase, primary emphasis was placed on encouraging the coordinated teaching of the history of American blacks in the nation's public schools. The expansion of Black History Week to Black History Month was first proposed by the leaders of the Black United Students at Kent State University in February 1969. The first celebration of the Black History Month took place at Kent State one year later, in February 1970. In 1976 as part of the United States Bicentennial, the informal expansion of Negro History Week to Black History Month was officially recognized by the U.S. government. President Gerald Ford spoke in regards to this, urging Americans to ""seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history."" This morning I want to impress upon you the importance of understanding your history - whether you are black, white, Native American, Hispanic, etc., you need to know. Why? Because when you understand the history you can better understand your approach to the future. When you understand your past others cannot define it for you and tell you what you should or not know, accept and ultimately believe based on ""their"" understanding of ""your"" past. When we know our past and can teach others who share a similar history, teach one, reach one, the past is not forgotten and we have evidence and fuel for the future. To prove this point, I want to give you a few examples."
1 Kings 8:56,"('Assurance', 'Assured', 'Unfailing', 'Assurance Of Salvation', 'Life After Death')",Baptist," GOD AND HIS DIVINE PROMISES GOD CAN NEVER BREAK HIS PROMISES TO MAN KIND . Unfailing. 1st Kings 8: 55 And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying, 56 Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant. 57 The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us: Assured by divine ability. Romans 4: 20 He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; 21 And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform. Grounded in Jesus Christ. 2nd Corinthians 1: 18 But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay. 19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea. 20 For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us. Of infinite Value 2nd Peter 1: 3 According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: 4 Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. Culminate in everlasting life. 1st John 2: 24 Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father. 25 And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life."
Psalms 32:1-11,"(""Jesus' Death"", 'Actions Of Jesus')",Christian/Church Of Christ," ""But Jesus Can!"" Psalm 32:1-11 David P. Nolte You've heard the phrase, ""Jack Of All Trades, Master Of None"" or, it might be, ""Jill of all trades"" for a woman. Such a person may set a hand to any number of tasks with greater or lesser skill but is likely not master of more than one or two. Then we all know the guy who, according to him, knows how to do it all and in a better way than anyone else. And to be honest we meet the rare, enviable, person who actually seems to be able to do anything he or she sets out to do. Most of us can do something with somewhat better than fair proficiency, and it is up to us to learn what God has equipped us to do and to do it with diligence. There is that One Who has it all together in one package: He knows everything because He is omniscient. He can do anything because He is omnipotent. He is with us always, everywhere and knows our needs because He is omnipresent! And He wants to do for us what none other can do because He is omnigracious. The song the trio sang puts it this way: ""I can't take a heart that's broken, Make it over again But I know a man who can. I can't take a soul that's sin sick make it white as the snow But I know a man who can."" There are numerous things we can't do that Jesus Christ does easily. Among those things would be, He saves, He keeps, He satisfies, He sanctifies, He provides, He enables and on and on. But let's look at what God did for King David - and let us be assured that God, in Jesus Christ, will do that for us as well! ""Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man whose sin the LORD does not count against him and in whose spirit is no deceit. When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer. Then I acknowledged my sin to You and did not cover up my iniquity. I said, 'I will confess my transgressions to the LORD' -- and You forgave the guilt of my sin. Therefore let everyone who is godly pray to You while You may be found; surely when the mighty waters rise, they will not reach him. You are my hiding place; You will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance. I will instruct You and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you and watch over you. Do not be like the horse or the mule, which have no understanding but must be controlled by bit and bridle or they will not come to you. Many are the woes of the wicked, but the LORD's unfailing love surrounds the man who trusts in Him. Rejoice in the LORD and be glad, you righteous; sing, all you who are upright in heart!"" Psalm 32:1-11 (NIV). I want to tell a story about a greedy and dishonest tailor who, like David, made bad choices and suffered for it. In a small town in Bohemia there lived a tailor so skilled that customers came to him from far and wide. His sewing was expert and the clothes he made were beautiful and hardy. But the tailor was greedy and dishonest. When asked how much silk or wool or satin he needed to make this coat or that suit, he always demanded more than was really required. Thus he was always able to keep a good piece of fine material for himself."""
Matthew 5:13-16,"('Evangelism', 'Salt And Light', 'Light Of The World', 'Salt Of The Earth')",Baptist," Matthew 5:13-16 Making a Lasting Impact Do you ever yearn to make a difference in the world? To do something significant with your life? Do you ever wonder, ""Why am I still on this earth?"" I tell you, there is no greater satisfaction than to know you have been used by God himself to touch someone's life perhaps for eternity! And being used by God is certainly not limited to pastors. Anyone can be used by God. Today Jesus calls us to consider--along with his original followers--who we really are in Christ. Last week, in the Beatitudes, Jesus talked a lot about what we do. We extend mercy, we receive comfort, we make peace. We receive lots of blessings as a result. Today it's not so much what we do, but who we are to a watching world. Who are you in Christ? And what makes you different from the rest of the world? Jesus uses two very emphatic ""you"" statements to tell you who you are. You are salt and you are light. An ancient Roman official once commented, ""There is nothing more useful than salt and sunshine."" Let's first consider salt. It has lots of redeeming qualities, such as making things more flavorful. Through our lives, we should invite others to ""taste and see that the Lord is good"" (Psalm 34:8). Or consider Colossians 4:5-6: ""Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity. Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone."" Salty Christians leave people wanting more of the gospel, more of God's love. Salt certainly adds flavor. But the ancient world prized it most for its use as a preservative; after all, this is before refrigeration. When we live as Christians, we help preserve the world; we make it a better place. Did you know it was Christians who formed the first literary programs on the streets of England? They called these reading programs for the poor ""Sunday School"" and used the Bible as the text. Christians built the first public hospitals. Christians built the first colleges and the first children's homes. Until the 1930s, churches alone cared for the downtrodden of society. Still today Christians lead the way in charitable giving. All these things help preserve the world--they help hold back the evil so that God can continue to save, as he wills no one to perish (2 Peter 3:9). But there's another way we act as a preservative, a more personal, individual way. When we share our faith with others, whether in word or deed, we partner with God to save some from the path of hell. We help preserve their souls, because every person matters! Everyone is precious to God. Jesus asks the question, ""But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot"" (v. 13). It's a puzzling question, because pure salt--sodium chloride--can never lose its saltiness. It will always be salty. Some think Jesus was referring to the polluted salt that came from the Dead Sea. It was mixed with minerals and lost its effectiveness over time. People would just throw it on paths to block the weeds."
James 1:19-27,"('Doer Of Word', 'Practical Living', 'Doer Of The Word')",Baptist," PRACTICAL CHRISTIAN LIVING #3 - ""Be Doers of the Word"" James 1:19 My dearly loved brothers, understand this: Everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger, 20 for man's anger does not accomplish God's righteousness. 21 Therefore, ridding yourselves of all moral filth and evil, humbly receive the implanted word, which is able to save you. 22 But be doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. 23 Because if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his own face in a mirror. 24 For he looks at himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. 25 But the one who looks intently into the perfect law of freedom and perseveres in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but one who does good works--this person will be blessed in what he does. 26 If anyone thinks he is religious without controlling his tongue, then his religion is useless and he deceives himself. 27 Pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself unstained by the world. INTRO: (Bucket List) How many of you know what a bucket list is? A bucket list is a list of things that people dream of doing before they ""kick the bucket."" What's interesting about a bucket list is that many of the things that people put on their list to do are things that are dangerous, or expensive, they would never consider doing normally, but once they are diagnosed with a terminal illness, decide to do them. In many cases, these bucket list items are things that they've talked about all their life, but never got around to doing it. It's sad that we let life keep us from doing so many things, but when we know life is about to end, we get busy living and doing. So, in essence, the bucket list is all about action; it's all about doing things, and not just talking, or hearing about others adventures rather than our own. The Scripture passage we read this morning from James is also all about action; it's about doing and not merely hearing. There's no shortage of people in our world today who have heard the Word of God. But, there is definitely a great need for those who will be DOERS and not HEARERS only. As we continue through the Book of James, you will see more and more just how practical God's Word can be. But, it must be put into practice in our lives before we can receive the power and benefit of the Word. God's Word is not just something we hear and discuss - it is something we hear and then DO! This morning as we examine in detail this passage we will ask and answer three important questions: 1) Why Should We Be Doers of the Word; 2) How Does Being a Doer of the Word Transform Us?; 3) What Does Being a Doer of the Word Look Like? Let's start with our first question: I. WHY SHOULD WE BE DOERS OF THE WORD? A. Because God ""says so."" (v. 22) James 1:22 But be doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. (Parent to child - ""because I said so"" - example of me and my kids - obey now / explain later)"
Ephesians 4:11-16,"('Unity', 'Spiritual Gifts', 'Spiritual Growth', 'Christian Maturity')",Baptist," The Necessity of Unity Ephesians 4: 11-16 Last week we began the series: Church - A New Testament Model. We looked at the means of entrance into the church through Christ the Door. This opportunity is available by grace through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Once entry into the church, the body of Christ is made, what comes next? Many either lack understanding or are content to remain where they are as babes in Christ. This was never the intent of Christ for the church. As we will discover, each member is individually gifted with abilities that aid in the growth and ministry of the church. Healthy churches are comprised of those who have identified their gifts, and committed to using their gifts to complement to varied gifts of others. Coming together in unity, and actively using our gifts is essential to the prosperity and growth of the church. Let's examine the aspects of Christian service essential to the church as we consider: The Necessity of Unity. I. The Provision Granted (11-12) - Paul spoke of the gracious provision of our Lord in equipping the church and providing for her spiritual health and prosperity. Consider: A. The Positions (11) - And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers. As the Lord sovereignly designed the church, He provided leaders with various gifts to meet the variety of needs she faced. There is much we could discuss in this verse. I am not afraid to deal with the truth it reveals, but lack the time in our study today to deal with it in a sufficient manner. For this study, suffice it to say that the Lord has provided those in positions of leadership to meet the needs of the church. B. The Expectations (12) - For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ. Paul goes on to reveal the expectations for such unique and varied giftedness among the church. These individual gifts are provided for: Perfecting of the Saints - This has the idea of preparation of the saints. God uses various spiritual gifts within the leadership to prepare and equip the believers to serve within the church. Many churches have the idea that ministry is reserved solely for paid staff. That is certainly not biblical, but it isn't the church's fault entirely. Men of God are called to prepare those within the church to be used of God. We are called to make disciples who make disciples. Work of Ministry - Those in leadership are expected to prepare believers to carry out the work of ministry. The responsibility of laboring in the harvest is to be shared by all who make up the body of Christ. If you are saved by grace, part of the church, you are expected to be engaged in the ministry efforts of the church. As we will discover, there is a work for all to perform. Edifying of the Body of Christ - The church is expected to encourage and support those within the body. She is responsible for her continued growth and prosperity. Granted, the Lord will provide the resources and abilities we need, but we are expected to engage in the work of building up the church and pursuing her continued growth!"
Daniel 5:1-30,"('Judgment', 'Repentance')",Assembly Of God," THE TWO MINUTE WARNING Daniel 5:1-31 INTRODUCTION A. HUMOR 1. ATLANTA JOKE The Atlanta Falcons had just finished their daily practice session when a large turkey came strutting onto the field and demanded to be given a chance to play at tight end. Everyone watched with wonder as the turkey caught pass after pass and ran right through the defensive line. When the turkey returned to the sidelines, the coach said, ""You're superb. Sign up for the season, and I'll see to it that you get a huge bonus."" ""Forget the bonus,"" replied the turkey, ""What I want to know is, does your season go past Thanksgiving Day?"" 2. PATRIOTS JOKE Bill Belichick looked over a new player and said, ""You can't play unless you can pass a basic arithmetic test. So concentrate hard and tell me the answer to this: What's two plus two?"" The player thought for a moment and then answered, ""4?"" ""Did you say 4?"" the coach exclaimed, excited that the player had actually got the right answer. Suddenly all the other players on the team began shouting, ""Come on coach, give him another chance!"" B. THE NFL 2-MINUTE WARNING 1. Huge matchup between Matt Ryan & Tom Brady; it promises to be a very close game, with odds makers only seeing a 3 point difference. 2. This morning I want to talk about the NFL's interesting custom of the ""two-minute warning."" 3. It's a moment when the referees stop the clock and let both teams know how much time remains in the game. 4. IT WARNS that the game will end soon, and that all-out efforts must be employed. It has become a strategic part of the game, helping teams focus, change the momentum. 5. A lot of teams have what they call a ""2-minute drill."" It's a bold, accelerated series of plays that are designed for those urgent moments when you realize the game is almost over and you're behind. 6. Some teams who are losing come back to win; and others, winning, begin to lose. The 2-minute warning gives the 2 teams a chance to change the game. C. 2 MINUTE WARNING IN SCRIPTURE 1 King Belshazzar gave a great banquet for a thousand of his nobles and drank wine with them. 2 While Belshazzar was drinking his wine, he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver goblets that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines might drink from them. 4 As they drank the wine, they praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood and stone. 5 Suddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace. The king watched the hand as it wrote. 6 His face turned pale and he was so frightened that his knees knocked together and his legs gave way. 7 The king called out for the enchanters, astrologers and diviners to be brought....8 but they could not read the writing or tell the king what it meant. 9 So King Belshazzar became even more terrified.... [He sent for Daniel, who said,] 22 ""But you his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled yourself.... 23 But you did not honor the God who holds in his hand your life and all your ways. 24 Therefore he sent the hand that wrote the inscription. 26 ""This is what these words mean: Mene : God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end. 27 Tekel : You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting. 28 Peres : Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians."" 30 That very night Belshazzar, king of the Babylonians, was slain."" Daniel 5:1-30."
John 12:1-19,"('Priorities', 'Jesus The King')",Anglican," We were discussing in our staff meeting this week the question of how you decide what to leave in your will, and to whom, when you die. As I was thinking about that I wondered how many of us have ever sat down and thought about what our priorities are in life; and when we come to write a will, to what extent do our stated priorities shape the content of our will. Have you ever done that? Have you ever stopped to think about what really matters to you and whether that's reflected in your will? Or in the way you live your present life for that matter. Let me suggest some of the things that people make their priorities. There's my wife and I. There's our children and grandchildren. For some there's their parents. There's work or study. For some there's a career path. There's our leisure time. There's our home; our retirement fund; our holiday fund; etc. You may want to add some other things in there. Of course I haven't mentioned God or his Church have I? But that's where today's passage comes in. Today we see various groups of people with vastly different attitudes to Jesus and vastly different priorities. Remember that Jesus has just preformed the greatest of his signs so far: the raising of Lazarus; and Martha has confessed: ""Lord, I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one coming into the world."" Now some time later, Jesus is again in Bethany enjoying a dinner put on for him, possibly by the townspeople assisted by Martha and Mary. Mark tells us it's held at the home of Simon the leper, if Mark's account is of the same incident, which seems likely. Martha is doing her thing, serving the meal when Mary again comes and kneels at Jesus feet, not to listen to him, not to mourn the death of Lazarus, but to anoint him. If Jesus is the king, Mary wants to anoint him. And she does it with very expensive perfume. Nard is an extract of a plant grown at high altitudes in India, hence its great cost. Mark tells us that she pours it on his head; John mentions his feet. It may be that she pours it on both but John wants us to see that this is an act of self-humbling devotion on the part of Mary, kneeling before her king. I think he also wants us to connect this anointing with the triumphal entry to Jerusalem described a few verses later. But before we look at that we need to notice a couple of contrasts that come out very clearly. First there's the contrast between Mary and Judas. As I said at the beginning, priorities matter. What I didn't say was that what we do with our money often reflects what our true priorities are. Remember Jesus saying: Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also? Well it works the other way around as well. Where your heart is that's where you'll invest your treasure. It's quite clear where Mary's heart is isn't it? A $60,000 jar of pure nard is nothing compared to the privilege of anointing the King of Israel. By contrast, Judas is more worried about what might be done with the money that this jar would bring in the market place - particularly if he could get his hands on it. It's interesting isn't it, that though he claims to be a disciple, a friend of Jesus, Judas doesn't have kingdom priorities. He's seems to be in it for what he can get out of it."
John 12:20-50,"('Repentance', ""God's Kingdom"")",Anglican," Sermon by Rev George Hemmings '1, 2, 4, 7, 9, Here we come.' That's how my sons, Micah and Joshua, like to count down when we play hide and seek. There's usually not much time to get ready! Actually every time they count down differently. One moment they're counting, the next they're seeking. There's no warning when the change will come, when the turning point will be. Life's a little like that isn't it? Sometimes big changes come, moments that turn our world around. Did you notice that today's passage is a turning point in John's gospel? If you think back through the passages we've looked at, if you read back through John, you'll see that everything has been building up to this point. He's performed all sorts of miraculous signs, which have led to crowds flocking to see him. He's fed those crowds with a poor boy's packed lunch. He's given sight to a man born blind, he's raised Lazarus from the dead. Then, as we saw last week, he was anointed by Mary and given a king's welcome as he rode into Jerusalem. But then, all of a sudden, everything changes. In verse 36 Jesus goes into hiding. In fact, today's passage is the last time Jesus appears in public, at least until his arrest and crucifixion. What's brought this on? Why this sudden change? It looks like just another day in the office for Jesus. Some people come wanting to see him. There's no surprise there. People have been trying to see Jesus for a long time. If you remember from last week, in verse 18, the great crowd that'd gathered to celebrate the Passover, rushed out to meet Jesus as he rode into the city. Now a small group of them want to see him. They come to Philip and request an interview. There's nothing unusual in this. But what's unusual is who these people are. John tells us they're not Jews, they're Greeks! [Perhaps that's why they went to Philip. He and Andrew are the only disciples with Greek names.] Now even the Gentiles, now even those outside of Israel, are seeking Jesus. It's a fulfilment of the Pharisees' words from verse 19. ""You see, you can do nothing. Look, the world has gone after him!"" By all accounts, this should be the high point of Jesus' ministry. He's no longer just a Jewish figure, now he's a worldwide name. He's like a musician who's been working hard, playing in pubs and clubs, who finally gets picked up, who's songs are on the radio, and in everybody's head. We see that Jesus knows this is a decisive moment. When he hears of the request from Andrew and Philip what does he say? 23Jesus answered them, ""The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified."" This is the real turning point in this passage, and in John's gospel. Up till now, it's been a case of the hour is not yet here. Think back to the very first sign, the turning of water into wine at the wedding at Canna. What did Jesus say to Mary? 4""My hour has not yet come."" (John 2:4). Again, when he was talking with the Samaritan woman at the well, Jesus twice said, ""The hour is coming."" It's there again in chapter 5 when Jesus says the hour is coming when the dead will hear his voice and live. Then in chapters 7 & 8, the authorities aren't able to arrest Jesus, because his hour had not yet come. It's like children asking 'Are we there yet?' The answer is not yet, not yet, not yet. But now, after all these not yets, the hour is finally here. Now Jesus says, ""The hour has come."""
Luke 22:31-32,"('Faith', 'Love', 'Restoration', 'Failure')",Assembly Of God," We all have had warnings given to us. Some were meant to help us as ""Look out for that car!"" ""Don't touch that! It's hot!"" They had implied promises because that car will hurt you will get burned. Other warnings were threats with negative promises. ""Don't make me pull this car over!"" The implied promise was that something very negative would happen to you and often you knew what unless your parents liked to change things up so you might get a surprise. I once asked my son if he wanted me to blister him. He said no quite emphatically! I asked if he knew what that meant and he said no just as emphatically. He had no clue, but it did not bode well or sound good and he wanted no part of it. Sometimes we do not know the promise, but the tone in which it is given is enough to change our course of action or attitude. Most did come out with the promise being very clear. ""If you do not quit crying I will give you something to cry about."" ""Don't make me say it again or you're grounded."" ""That phone pings one more time during supper and I am taking it away for a month!' A co-worker and I once threatened to break a co-worker's phone if it pinged one more time with an annoying sound. Jesus gave a stern warning to Peter at the Last Supper. Fortunately, there wee actually two positive promises along with the warning. Luke 22: 31 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: 32 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. Early in my Christian walk, I aspired to be like Peter and Paul. The problem was I was only looking at their good days and not their bad days as well. I do seem to have many of their weaknesses, but I was hoping for their strengths. After Jesus, I want to meet my soul brother, Peter, and then Paul, my mentor. This is a serious warning Peter is being given, but I imagine Jesus giving it in a very loving tone. When someone said your name twice in that day it was almost like when your parents called you a couple of times and you did not respond. That is when they broke out all three names. Repeating Simon twice was to make sure he was listening. To tell him that Satan desired to have him would make you think Peter was really going to pay attention. The desire was in the intensity of a demand! Satan was saying something like, ""Let me have him! I'll show you what your lead man is like!"" It wasn't a small request. Satan wanted to have at him much like he wanted God to remove the hedge from around Job. Picture the meanest junkyard dog snarling and straining at his chain to come for you and you may have a nearly accurate picture of satan desiring Peter. Sift like wheat is not a small thing. Many of us remember Mom or MeMaw making homemade pie crusts or dumplings. She would roll out her dough after having placed the flour in a sifter to get out the clumps. The sifting satan wanted to do was more like threshing wheat where you thrashed and thrashed it to separate the chaff from the wheat. He had a real beating in mind for Peter, not just a soft sifting like Mom's flour. It was a knock down drag out desire. He had that desire, but as we shall see, I think Jesus put limits on satan just like God did for Job, but the sifting was still painful."
John 13:1-30,"('Leadership', 'Servanthood', 'Washing Feet')",Anglican," Sermon by Rev George Hemmings I wonder what you think a leader looks like? We asked that question at the CLAY small group on Friday night. Actually we asked people to draw a typical leader, and their qualities, and this is what we got. I wonder how that matches up to your ideas of a leader? I think there's some pretty good descriptions in there. Confident, forward thinking, respectable. Few supermen there. Glad that at least one person drew a female leader. A few people drew tall, strong powerful. All in all, I think a pretty good likeness! And I didn't have to pay anyone anything to write those things! What would you add? If we use that list as a guide, Jesus is a real leader. He ticks a lot of those boxes. He's got followers. He's got a great vision of the future. He knows his hour has come, the hour for the Son of Man to be glorified. The hour has come to depart from this world and go the Father. Along with this Jesus is forward thinking. As we saw a fortnight ago, Jesus has withdrawn from public. He's spending time with the disciples, preparing them for what's to come. He's preparing them for the Cross, and he's preparing them for what comes after that. We see that in today's passage as he tell them, they won't fully understand what he's doing just yet. And Jesus speaks wisely, he's a good orator, and is knowledgeable. The disciples call him Teacher. They also call him Lord. At this point might just be a polite title, the equivalent of 'Sir' today. But in time the disciples will realise that he's the LORD. And Jesus is certainly powerful. '3Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands.' He's got absolute power and authority. And he's a leader who takes charge, who's in complete control. Even in the face of betrayal of Judas, Jesus knows what is going to happen, and is even in control of this as we see in verse 27. What do you think a leader is like? To help us think about this, we've decided to host a leadership seminar at church today. We've asked a few people who are influential leaders in their workplaces to hold a seminar to help us think about leadership. So I'd like to welcome to the stage, Guy, Ian, Ruth and Chris. [To those reading online, at this point the St. Thomas' Youth Group performed a short skit. You should listen online!] Thank you very much! I should say any resemblance to figures real or imagined is entirely coincidental. But in this passage Jesus does some very un-leader like things. He's gathered with his disciples to share a meal. (That's a good thing for leader's to do). It's likely the Passover supper. Everyone's taken their places at the table. It wouldn't have been a nice big dinning table like we're used to, but a low table, probably U shaped. As was the custom, especially at important feasts, they were probably reclining. Resting on their left arms, ready to use their right hands to eat, legs pointing away from the table. But during the meal, perhaps just before, or just after the food has been brought out, Jesus gets up. John says he took off his outer robe. That's a polite way of saying he stripped down to his jocks. He takes everything but his loincloth off. I don't know about you, but that's not something I'd expect a leader to do. In fact if we're at a staff lunch and Chris was to do that, I'd be pretty shocked. But what Jesus is doing is dressing down, to the level of a slave. As shocking as that would be, what he does next is even more incredible."
John 13:31-14:14,"('Holy Spirit', 'Another Comforter')",Anglican," Sermon by Rev George Hemmings Sarah & I have learnt that we need to give our boys Micah and Joshua plenty of warning before we leave somewhere, especially if they're having a good time. If we try to just say, 'OK, it's time to go,' without any warning, they're usually not too happy. You might need to do the same with your family or friends, especially if you've driven somewhere together. In these few chapters of John's gospel, that's exactly what Jesus is doing. He's preparing the disciples for his imminent departure. Now that Judas has gone out, now that the final betrayal has begun, Jesus knows that the Cross is inevitable. Jesus might've hoped that as he offered Judas the choice morsel back in verse 26, that Judas would see the light, that he would repent, that he would turn back. But instead Judas rejected Jesus, he turned to darkness, and was sent off into the night. And so now Jesus' betrayal, his arrest and trial, his suffering and death are inevitable. The wheel's been set in motion, as we say in English. So Jesus can say that the 'Son of Man has been glorified,' as though it's already happened. All that remains is to prepare the disciples for what's coming. Did you see how Jesus speaks to them? It's tender, and gentle. He calls them 'little children.' It's not a patronising term, but a loving one. They've just shared the Passover together, something that was normally done in families, so it's a fitting term. 'Dear little children,' Jesus says, 'I am with you only a little longer.' He doesn't try to sugar coat it, or downplay what's about to happened, but tells them plainly that he's leaving. And so they don't think that he's just popping around to a friend's for a cup of tea, or heading out for a holiday by the sea, Jesus says, 'Where I am going you cannot come.' He's breaking the bad news that he's about to go away, and that at least for the time being, they can't come with him. If you've ever gone away for a while you might leave instructions for those staying home. You might tell your children to behave themselves while you're gone. You might ask your neighbours or friends to check your mail and put the bins out for you. You could ask your co-workers to look after some of your jobs. While he's gone Jesus has just one job for his disciples, one new commandment. It's a pretty simple one isn't it? Simple enough a child could understand it. 'Love one another, just as I have loved you, you also should love one another.' You might think Jesus doesn't know his Old Testament very well, because he calls this a new commandment. The covenant with Moses contained two very important instructions about love: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul and with all your strength.' (Deut. 6:5) and;"
John 14:15-31,"('Holy Spirit', ""Don't Worry"")",Anglican," It seems to me that there are 2 issues that Christians face today that Jesus addresses here in this passage. The first is the question as to how we're rating as a Christian. That is are we good enough for God to be happy with us? Are we good enough that God would listen to our prayers? How do you rate as a Christian? The second issue has to do with how we know what's the right thing to do; how we decide what we're to do or say at any one moment. Last week we saw how John 14 begins with the disciples being faced with just this problem. Jesus has just told them that he's about to leave them, then he says these words to reassure them: ""Do not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God, believe also in me."" They're clearly meant as words of comfort but you can imagine some of them thinking ""That's all very well, but it's just pie in the sky when you die. I'm worried about what's going to happen in the next few months when Jesus isn't here to help us and guide us."" Up until now they've hardly done a thing without Jesus being there to direct them, or to correct them. Now they're going to be on their own. It's like the first time you're allowed to take a car out for a drive by yourself; or how I imagine a pilot feels when they're sent up to fly solo for the first time. The instructor's not there anymore and everything depends on you. So Jesus sets out to give them some more reassurance. ""If You Love Me."" The first bit of reassurance he gives them comes in the form of a proposition: ""If you love me, you will keep my commandments."" Notice this isn't a conditional statement so much as a statement of where they are with him. Those who are worried about how they rate as Christians might well read this as a test. If you keep his commandments you'll get a good score. But in fact Jesus' implication is that they do love him. That's not in question. In the next chapter he'll point out that he considers them his friends. It's because they love him that he's confident they'll keep his commandments. If you think about it that's how loving relationships work isn't it? When we love someone we're glad to do what pleases them. Our children occasionally need to be disciplined for not doing what they're told, but mostly they do it, not from fear of punishment but because they love us and they know we love them and so they want to do what we need done. So there's the first bit of reassurance. They don't need Jesus with them physically in order to do what's right; they'll do it anyway, just because they love him. Another Advocate But then he promises them someone who'll continue the relationship they have with him. He says ""16And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, to be with you forever. 17This is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, because he abides with you, and he will be in you."""
2 Samuel 15:1-12,"('Justice', ""God's Judgment"")",Independent/Bible," 2 Sam 15:1-12 TRUSTING GOD IN AN UNJUST WORLD ES 5 Feb 17 1667 Life in a sinful world will not be neat and tidy, because sin and sinful people are present. That includes us, before we know Christ. "" Over the course of the last few chapters (2 Samuel), we have seen the innocent abused, the guilty went unpunished, the decent driven to commit murder, and the one who has the power to do something good, remained silent. "" Life in a sinful world is messy. It is unsightly when we look at things from a surface level. We need to look at life from a spiritual perspective. God is around, throughout these chapters. We know it because we have the privilege of reading history from hindsight. "" If we pay attention to what God said earlier (through prophet Nathan to David) in 2 Sam 12:10-11, ""Now, therefore, the sword will never depart from your house, because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.' 11""This is what the LORD says: `Out of your own household I am going to bring calamity upon you..."" "" God has declared His judgement or discipline for David's sin and it would come from within his household. God expected this. The calamity was part of God's plan. God is in control even in the mess we are facing in life. He will work through the darkness and lead us to the light, if we cling on to Him. "" And when we reach the light (at the end of the tunnel), we will gain a deeper understanding of God. We will come to know Him, through His dealings with us. "" Ultimately, the purpose is not a simple ""remove evil"" or ""eradicate sin"". It is to help us see Him, know Him and therefore trust Him. Sadly, Absalom was not able to trust God for all that was happening in his life. "" For a start, he knew little about God. Looking at the environment he was raised in, he hardly knows the God of his father David. "" Even if he has glimpses of God, this picture has been badly marred by human sin. He saw little righteousness and much injustice. His half-brother Amnon raped his sister Tamar, and his father, the King, did nothing about it. "" Tamar came to live with him. Everyone pretended that nothing has happened, but Absalom could see ""injustice"" (his distraught sister) every day, in his house. "" As expected, he would eventually killed Amnon two years later, when given the chance (2 Sam 13B). This was his way of getting justice. Someone needs to right the wrong, and he has to do it. Frankly a second wrong will not make the first one right. "" With that murder, Absalom had to flee and he fled to Geshur, his grandfather Talmai's place. "" 13:38 says he stayed there for three years, in exile. David did not connect with him. "" Joab, the commander of David's army and his nephew, urged him to allow Absalom to come back. He did return but... "" 14:28 ""Absalom lived two years in Jerusalem without seeing the king's face."" He was not allowed into the palace and they did not interact for another two years. When they finally met, at the end of chapter 14, after five years, the damage had been done. It wasn't a meeting between a loving father and his forgiven son."
John 15:1-17,"('Bearing Fruit', 'Abiding In The Vine')",Anglican," Today is the first anniversary of the opening of St Thomas'. A lot's happened in the last year hasn't it? We've had a number of people join us. We've seen lots of new programs starting up, taking advantage of these great facilities. It makes you feel good to be part of it doesn't it? In fact just being part of the Christian church is a good thing, whether or not you've got great facilities like these. I wonder have you thought about what it means for you to be a Christian? For some it means the comfort of knowing that you're on God's side? For some it's being part of a wider community of people who are mutually dependent and supportive? It might mean being part of a world-wide community of people who share a love for and who worship the one God? But you know, while being a Christian might mean all of those things to different people, none of them is at the heart of what Jesus says it means to be Christian. Here in John 15 Jesus begins to teach his disciples what it means to be one of his followers. He says the whole point of being one of his followers is to bear fruit to the Father's glory. In fact, he says if you don't bear fruit, there's something wrong. Have a look at John 15:1. He begins with the statement that he is the true vine and his Father the vinegrower. Now for the disciples this would have rung loud bells. The image of a vine or a vineyard was a common image of the nation of Israel. That's what we read in our first reading from Is 5. There, in the song of the vineyard, God tells how he planted a vineyard, meaning the people of Israel, and looked for it to bear grapes, but all he found were wild grapes, of no use to him. And so he says he'll tear down that vineyard, make it a waste, because it didn't bear the fruit that God required from it. Israel had failed to do what God required, and so would be left a desolate wasteland. But now Jesus has come and he declares that he is the true vine. He is the one who will obey the Father and please him in all he does (v10) the way Israel failed to do. But if Jesus is the vine, those who have joined him as his followers are grafted in and become branches of that same vine. And that means that we too are expected to bear fruit. If we don't bear fruit, the Father, the vine grower, will prune us. He'll take away those parts of us that are unfruitful, or that are bearing wild grapes, and those parts that are bearing fruit he'll prune to make them even more fruitful. Have you ever had a grape vine and watched how it grows? It first sends out shoots, some of which have flowers on them which become grapes. But then about the time that the grapes are beginning to ripen, it'll suddenly have a spurt of growth. New branches spring out of the vine, new growth. To the casual observer it looks wonderful, full of health and vigour. But the vine grower isn't interested in lush growth; he's interested in luscious grapes. So one of the jobs of the vine grower is to go along and prune those branches that don't have any fruit on them."
John 15:18-16:15,"('Persecution', 'Hardship', 'Rejection', 'Connecting With God')",Anglican," Sermon by Rev Ruth Newmarch After the happiness of Steph and Nic's wedding yesterday, its hard to hear about suffering for our faith. But if you think about it, hardship is mentioned even in the wedding service, 'for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health...'. In today's passage, it is Jesus' final evening with his disciples, there are empty dishes on the table, their feet have been freshly washed, and one of them has gone into the night. But two things have kept recurring in Jesus' conversation. Firstly, he's leaving them and returning to the Father, but the Holy Spirit is coming to replace him. There's rich Trinitarian material here, but the main point is that by believing in Jesus, the disciples are brought into the life of God! They're threaded into the very love and life of the Godhead...like the grape-grower's vine, with its branches and fruit. The second things that has kept recurring is, they must stay connected to the life of God. How will they do this? They must obey his commandment to love each other. They must serve each other in humility, during their physical separation from Jesus. But in our passage today, Jesus prepares the disciples for - rejection by the world. Now remember the 'world' in John doesn't mean the world God created for us to enjoy, but the moral world, a way of thinking that stands in opposition to God. A few years ago Ben Wong, Ivy's husband, was preaching at a baptism service for new believers from mainland China. I was surprised that he made point after point about the hardships they might encounter. Their business might not be as successful; splits might occur in the family; they might not get promotions; they might not be as welcome in certain social circles; their status in the Chinese community might well go down, not up. Ben wanted these new believers to be prepared when they encountered opposition from the world. In verse 18 Jesus tells the disciples the world will hate them. Why? Quite simply because they hated Jesus first. He had chosen them out of the world, so the world reacts in anger towards them, v 19. Like the White Witch in Narnia, the world is not happy when Aslan is on the move bringing warmth and life and spring in his wake. But Jesus reminds the disciples that a servant isn't greater than their master, v 20, so if Jesus was persecuted, they may endure hardship too. If people kept Jesus' words, so some would also keep the disciples' words. But notice that Jesus is the immovable One, like a lighthouse. He is the stationary object around which the waters swirl. His light can be heeded... or ignored. But why would you ignore a lighthouse? Only if you don't know what the flashes mean. And if you don't know what the flashes mean, its because you don't know there's a lighthouse keeper...the one who sends the message for your survival. People who ignore Jesus, don't know the light-house keeper, the Father, the one from whom the light emanates, who sends the Light, verse 21 tells us. Verse 21 also says hardship will come 'on account of my name'. If we have become connected into the life of God through Jesus, we are his family, we bear his name! We are Christians. We get both the glory and suffering of Christ."
John 16:16-33,"('Resurrection', 'Hope', 'Jesus Is Alive')",Anglican," Sermon by Rev George Hemmings I wonder how you felt last night as you were winding your clocks back? As you contemplated how great an extra hour of sleep would be. After I'd adjusted the clock on the oven, and the microwave, after Sarah fixed the clock-radio by our bed, as we thought about the promise that the future held, we knew we didn't have a hope! Even though I'd changed the gro-clock in Micah and Joshua's room, we knew we didn't have a hope of getting them to stay in bed for longer, let alone convincing Jacob that he could go an extra hour before needing milk. Hope is the expectation that our desires will be fulfilled. It's future focused, and our future didn't look great. And without hope, it's hard to have any lasting joy. So when we feel hopeless, truly hopeless, it's hard to carry on. The disciples were a pretty hopeless bunch. They're just a gaggle of former fishermen and retired taxmen. They've enjoyed a few good years in the sun, but all that's about to change. They didn't realise it when they sat down, but this is their last meal with Jesus. And think about what he's spent the meal talking about. He's told them he's about to abandon them, that he's returning to his Father. He's told them that one of them will betray him. He's told them that Peter, one of the inner circle will deny him. And he's just told them they're all about to have a rough time, as the world will persecute them! Talk about hopeless! What hope do they have for the future? Without their friend and leader, with the best and the brightest of them in doubt, with the world arrayed against them? It's true that along the way Jesus has spoken words of comfort, has promised that his going away is all for their good, and that he's going to send another advocate, the Holy Spirit, to guide, empower and equip them. But none of that has sunk in. Jesus's been speaking in figures, in difficult words, saying things that they just can't understand yet. As the meal draws to an end, Jesus has one more confusing thing to say to them. 'A little while, and you will no longer see me, and again a little while, and you will see me.' What is he on about? What's he saying now. It's like a riddle. What gets bigger the more you take away? (A hole.) Like a riddle, the disciples try to figure out for themselves what Jesus is talking about. They begin to say, 'What's he on about? What does he mean, a little while and you will no longer see me and a little while and you will see me?' It's clear he's not talking about playing hide and seek. They've got some ideas about what he might mean. They're wondering if this has anything to do with him saying that he must go back to the Father as he mentioned back in verse 5. But, even though Jesus had gently rebuked them for not asking what he meant when he said he was going back to the Father, they're not ready to ask about the meaning of the riddle just yet. They know the key is in what Jesus meant by 'a little while' as verse 18 makes clear. They just can't work it out! Well, they've been talking about this amongst themselves, perhaps while Jesus was out of the room, but he knows what they've been wondering. He isn't confused. He knows they want to know what he knows. He knows what's on their mind and he takes the initiative. He doesn't need them to ask him any questions, he already knows what they want to know. He says, 'Are you discussing among yourselves what I meant when I said, 'A little while and you will no longer see me, and a again a little while and you will see me?' As if he really needs to ask the question. He already knows the answer is yes."
John 17:1-26,"(""Jesus' Prayer"",)",Anglican," The Prayer of Jesus audio (5MB) John 17:1-26 The moment of Jesus arrest, trial and execution is fast approaching. Jesus has finished his teaching of the disciples. The hour has come. His work on earth is complete. So complete in fact that he can say with confidence at the end of ch16: ""33Take courage; I have conquered the world!"" And then he turns to prayer. Notice that John chooses to bring us a report of this prayer, given in the upper room before they go to Gethsemane, rather than the prayer of anguish in the garden that we find in the other gospels. Why does he do that? Well, it may be that this prayer acts in some way as a summary of all that's gone before in this gospel. Here we find Jesus' obedience to the Father; the glorification of his father through his death and resurrection; the revelation of God in Jesus Christ; the choosing of the disciples out of the world; their unity modelled on the unity of the Father and the Son; and the promise that their final destiny is to share in the glory of the Father and the Son in eternity. It's as though this is the final crescendo, the final movement in a gospel that shows us Christ dwelling among us as one of us but returning to God and taking us with him, a crescendo that climaxes in chs 18-20 with the passion and triumph of Jesus the Messiah. Jesus can say with confidence that he has overcome the world, yet he turns in the next breath to prayer, to ask God to bring him the victory. In fact the prayer he prays is divided into three parts. First he prays for himself, then he prays for the disciples, then he prays for all those who will come to believe in him through their testimony. Now, as we go through this prayer I want you to notice two things. First of all, notice how Jesus' priorities are reflected in the things he prays for. You may have found this true for you. When you find yourself under stress, do you find yourself concentrating on are the things that really matter. So it is with Jesus as he prays, knowing that the end is near. But notice also how the way Jesus prays can be a model for us in our prayer life. We'll see in a moment how he prays for himself, then how he prays for those he's been ministering to, and finally, how he has a long term view in mind as well as he prays. Jesus Prays for Himself Jesus has just finished saying that he's overcome the world, and now he stops to pray. And the first thing he prays is that God would glorify him. Now at first sight this sounds like a fairly self-serving prayer. But to understand what he's asking we need to think about what's involved in Jesus being glorified. In fact he's already talked about being glorified back in John 12. You may remember how when some Greeks came to see him, Jesus recognised it as a sign that the end had come. So he says, ""The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. 24Very truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains just a single grain; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."" (John 12:23-24 NRSV) Then he says """"Now my soul is troubled. And what should I say -- 'Father, save me from this hour'? No, it is for this reason that I have come to this hour. 28Father, glorify your name."" Then a voice came from heaven, ""I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again."""" (John 12:27-28 NRSV)"

What I found interesting was the titles this man had. He was called: "" Ngwenyama, or the Lion. "" He is also known as the Sun, "" the Milky Way, "" the Master in Weapons, "" the Obstacle to the Enemy, "" the Mouth that Speaks No Lies, "" the Miraculous Body That Grows Feathers in Winter While Others Are Without Plumage, "" and the Jaw That Cracks All Bones. (Readers Digest 10/77 p. 106) Now, why on earth would he have all those names? Well, he was a king of a very small country (Swaziland, about the size of New Jersey that was virtually surrounded by much larger nations in the area of South Africa) and I suspect that he figured that the more names he had, the bigger and more important he would seem to others. That's why a lot of people try to have ""titles"" in front of their names, or letters behind their names - they want to be important, and they don't think they can be important without the titles. That's also one of the reasons God warned us about being too attached to titles for ourselves: ""... you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have only one Master and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth 'father,' for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called 'teacher,' for you have one Teacher, the Christ. The greatest among you will be your servant."" Matthew 23:8-11 But folks who think like that are right - the more important a person is, the more titles and descriptions people will use to for them. That's especially true of Jesus. ILLUS: Billy Sunday, a famous evangelist of the last century said: ""There are 256 names in the Bible for the Lord Jesus Christ, and I suppose this was because He was infinitely beyond all that any one name could express."" Now, what we're looking this month are a few of the titles the Bible uses for Jesus. And the first title on our list is the ""Lamb of God. Of all the titles Jesus has been given in Scripture this seems to be one of the most common. In the book of Revelation (for example) Jesus is called the ""Lamb"" no less than 26 times. But here in the gospel of John, we find John the Baptist being the first one to declare: ""Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world"" John 1:29 To understand how important this proclamation was it helps to realize just who John the Baptist was. John's job was to ""reveal"" or introduce Jesus to the people of Israel. Isaiah tells us that John's job was to ""Prepare the way of the Lord..."" Isaiah 40:3 So when John declared that Jesus was the Lamb of God...that meant something. But what exactly did it mean? It meant he was answering a question that was asked way back in the book of Genesis. And the question was this: Where is the lamb? And John the Baptist declared: Here he is! Here is the Lamb!!! The question was asked in Genesis 22 where we're told the story of a man of faith named Abraham. Most of you may know the story, but what happened was this: God promised Abraham that he would have a son, and when he and his wife were nearly 100 years old, God gave them what He promised."
1 Corinthians 2:1-12,"('Plan', 'Power', 'Purpose', 'Football')",Lutheran," Introduction Does anyone know what today is? Has anyone heard what's going on later? THE event of today is about someone important and something significant. Super bowl fifty-one will be played at Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas. Some of you may have heard about this somewhat followed event. Some of you may have heard about the two teams, the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons. There have been plenty of words spoken about the abilities of these two teams and the players who compose their ranks. I've listening to the television as folks look forward to the game today, so many make predictions on what this player will do, or how that player will react. There has been an abundance of ""lofty speech"" and ""wisdom"" from players and coaches, from fans and commentators, in print, and on countless sports talk shows. But, in the last few weeks there has been some media blitz, with thousands of reporters grabbing and grasping for any kind of story. Some of the conversation has been expected with talk about one team's capabilities versus the other, or the statistics throughout the season. Yes folks, today is a special day. Today is football sermon day. On the Atlanta side.... commentators have stated that the Falcons will win because of their outstanding offense, the best in the NFL, the defensive and offensive talents of an amazing player, Vic Beasley, and a team coach who not only understands his team's strengths and weaknesses, but understands how to use them to his advantage, and take the risks necessary to close the gap with his adversaries. Oh yes, some say the Falcons will prove to be the champions today! But, wait, there's more. Everyone doesn't exactly see it this way. In fact, all of the conversation hasn't been on the Falcons side.... Oh no! In fact, other writers believe that New England has the edge in this ultimate pit of football wills. Some believe that the Patriots are going to take the winning trophy home. Some feel that the Pats, as they're often called, have the right combination of players that can round out the team on both the offensive and defensive sides of the field. Even when some very talented players have left the Pats, New England has found a way to fill the void in the capabilities of the team. But, the biggest claim of those supporting the Patriots, is that, now get this... Tom Brady wants a win just too bad! So, there you have it, some root for the Falcons while others say the Patriots will be triumphant today. I'll leave it up to each of you to decide which of these conversations has any real value. Most of the conversation has really been saying a lot about nothing, and the game itself, will settle it all. Someone will do something spectacular. Or something will happen to someone, that's unexpected, and either awful or awesome. A referee will make a call that some praise, and others condemn, but will likely be controversial. A player will perform less than expected, while another will certainly prove the star player of the day."
"Matthew 27:57-28:20, John 20:1-9","('Resurrection',)",Assembly Of God," Easter - the resurrected Saviour. Matthew 27:57-28:20 During the last few weeks we studied about the cross and what it meant to us. The scriptures tell us that on the first Good Friday darkness came over the land from the sixth hour until the ninth hour or from about noon to three pm. The earth itself was mourning and protesting the death of its Creator and you have the great symbolism of the Light of the world being extinguished and the world being plunged into darkness. It was also a dark day for the disciples and for the early followers of Christ. All that they had sacrificed, all that they had lived for, all that they had believed was seemingly gone. They had identified themselves with this man, whom they were convinced was the Messiah, only to see Him die in the worst possible way He hadn't even defended Himself! They took this death as a sign that He was not who He had claimed to be and all of them had fled and abandoned Christ and turned away whether by their words, or their actions. They thought it was over. Jesus spent much of His last days teaching these men that this would happen. He taught them that He would suffer, He taught them that He would die, but He always linked it with a triumphal resurrection. He always included that He would rise from the grave and that He would be the conquering Son of God who would provide victory! Jesus had made sure that His disciples would be ready. But because of the way that He died, the disciples lost hope. All of that talk of rebuilding the temple in three days was thrown out of the window. They forgot what it was that Christ had taught them. Remember, these are the men that God chose to change the world through, these are the men who knew Jesus better than any other men on Earth, these were the ones who had been taught and trained and invested in for three years, and yet they now were so sure of defeat that they went away. Today I want to look at the last chapter and a half of the book of Matthew. I want to pull out the facts and offer proof that Jesus Christ has risen indeed! Let's begin by looking at: I. The Facts There are certain things that we know, they are not in question. These are documented not only by the historical record of the Bible, but by every other reliable book of history that we have. These are facts that were accepted by all at that time, even those who opposed everything that Christ stood for and did. A. Christ Died on that Cross. The death of Christ was never in question. There are some today who try to explain away the post resurrection appearances by saying that Christ never really died on that cross. We know that He died for several reasons. 1) The Romans were Experts The Romans had perfected the art of torture and crucifixion. They crucified hundreds of thousands of people during the years of their empire. They knew what they were doing. So, when the soldiers came to Christ in order to break His legs and found that He was already dead, you can be sure that they knew what death looked like."
1 Samuel 15:17-22,"('Renewal', 'Repentance', 'Sanctification', 'Myths')",Baptist," REPENTANCE SERIES Online Sermon: http://www.mckeesfamily.com/?page_id=3567 Last week we started off this series by talking about repentance, sin and the character of God. Repentance is the first word of the Gospel message and it has proven to be very difficult for humanity to understand and put into action. Sin is defined as any thought, word or deed that goes against the will of God as revealed by His Spirit and Word. When we sin, we become distant from God because He is pure light and there is no darkness in Him at all. Repentance is the mechanism that God has given us to be forgiven and have our relationship restored with Him. Since we are ambassadors and royal priests who have the gift of the Holy Spirit, then why are we not continually being forgiven and walking close with God every moment of every day? PART 2: MYTHS, WHAT REPENTANCE IS NOT 1 Samuel 15:17-22 The problem of course is not with God. To those who truly repent He always forgives and cleanses from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9). For many repentance is not the rending of one's heart and the returning to walk on the narrow path of righteousness but in nothing more than hollow platitudes, ways of saying ""sorry"" without having to give up practicing the sin! While God is willing to forgive as many times as one repents (Matthew 18:22), He certainly will not be fooled into washing as white as snow (Isaiah 1:18) any sin that remains cherished and worn like a badge of honor. The reason why holiness and closeness to God remain beyond our reach is because we have believed and practiced many worldly myths concerning how to repent. This sermon will explore seven of these myths: sorrow, preservation, penance, reform, self-deception, selective and no consequence. 1. SORROW IS NOT ENOUGH Christians often think that being sorry automatically means one is repentant and forgiven. In the world we live in a few tears often have the power to wash away our wrongdoings. Who has not watched a sibling shed a few tears to win mom or dad over to their side of the story, especially when they were guilty? Who has not heard of a pretty girl not getting a ticket for speeding just because she told a heart wrenching story with a few tears? Who has not seen a student hand in an assignment two weeks late tell a tearful story so that they might have their assignment accepted? When you watch events like these you almost want to scream out ""don't be fooled, he or she will repeat the bad behavior as soon as you are out of the room!"" The rich young man is one of the best examples in Scripture (Mark 10:17-27) of being sorry but not forgiven. One day a man ran up to Jesus, fell on his knees and asked ""what must I do to inherit eternal life (17)?"" Jesus told him to follow His commands. The man replied ""all these I have kept since I was a boy"" (20). Even though he followed God's commands the man knew in his heart that there was something keeping him from entering the kingdom. Jesus told him to ""go, sell everything you have and give it to the poor."" Jesus said this because He knew the man's sin was his love of money. At the end of the story we are told the man left with great sorrow because he could not give up his money. From this story, we learn that while sorrow is a very important first step in repentance, it is not enough to be forgiven. Like the rich young man our repentance must go beyond being sorry for having sinned. We can tear up all we want but until we love God more than our sin, we will never ask nor have that sin forgiven."

"" And you might be thinking we have enough names of our own. "" The top5 UK boys' names for 2016 were: 1. Oliver 2. Jack 3. Harry 4. George 5. Jacob "" The top 5 UK girls' names for 2016 were: 1.

2 Peter 2:1-10,"('Godliness', 'Truth', 'False Apostles', 'Ungodliness')",Brethren," SERMON OUTLINE: (1). A Corrupt Doctrine. (2). A Corrupt Character. (3). A Corrupt Experience SERMON BODY: Reading: 2 Peter chapter 2 verses 4-10 Ill: Difference Between Men and Women: "" A woman worries about the future until she gets a husband. "" A man never worries about the future until he gets a wife. "" A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife can spend. "" A successful woman is one who can find such a man. "" To be happy with a man you must understand him a lot & love him a little. "" To be happy with a woman you must love her a lot & not try to understand her at all. "" Any married man should forget his mistakes; "" After all, there's no use in two people remembering the same thing. "" Men wake up as good-looking as they went to bed. "" Women somehow deteriorate during the night. "" A woman marries a man expecting he will change, but he doesn't. "" A man marries a woman expecting that she won't change & she does. "" A woman has the last word in any argument. "" Anything a man says after that is the beginning of a new argument. "" There are 2 times when a man doesn't understand a woman ; "" Before marriage & after marriage. "" TRANSITION: Men and women are very different; "" In many ways opposites to each other. "" Although, scientists decoding the human genome; "" Have discovered that just 78 genes separate men from women, "" So maybe we are not as different as we might think! "" The topic I have been asked to speak on tonight is 'ungodliness' "" And ungodliness is simply the opposite of godliness. (1). The Context (vs 1-3). "" The context for the verses you have given me to speak on; "" Is false prophets and false teachers. "" Look at verse 1: ""But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them--bringing swift destruction on themselves. 2 Many will follow their depraved conduct and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. 3 In their greed these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories."" "" As a family we have enjoyed several holidays in Turkey, "" And in the town called Kalkan where we have stayed. "" If you go into the town centre and along the sea front shops, "" You will come across a Jewellers shop, "" In the window of that shop is a great big sign that says; 'Genuine Fakes'. "" TRANSITION: The apostle Peter warned his readers about religious fakes; "" False teachers who are like those fake watches; "" On the outside they look like a genuine Rolex or a Versace; "" But when you removed the cover you discover on the inside they are fake. "" They probably contain cheap imitation parts. The apostle Peter warns his readers then and now about false teachers: "" He summarises the methods of false teachers: "" Four things that reveal them. "" FIRST: They appear to be regular members of the Church. "" i.e. At first they are hard to spot because they are like chameleons, blending in.

Ephesians 4:31-32,"('Forgiveness', 'Forgiving Others', 'Making Amends', 'Offering Apology')",Baptist," Sometimes newspapers have to publish corrections to previous stories. Occasionally, in their attempt to make amends, they make it worse. For example, one paper published a correction that said, ""In a recent article we referred to the Chairman of Chrysler Corporation as Lee Iacoocoo. That was incorrect. His real name is Lee Iacaca."" What these people were trying to do with these corrections was to make right what they had got wronged. That's what we're going to consider today. How do we go back and repair some of the damage done to us and we have done to others. That's the next ""E"" in ""recovery."" Evaluate all my relationships, offer forgiveness to those who've hurt me and make amends for harm I've done to others except, when to do so, would harm them or others. (READ TEXT) 1. I'm to forgive those who've hurt me. Why? A. Because God has forgiven me. If God has forgiven me, I should forgive others. "". . . forgive anyone who offends you. Remember, the Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others."" - Colossians 3:13 (NLT) I'll never have to forgive others more than God has forgiven me. If I have a hard time forgiving it's usually because I don't feel forgiven. This is why we talked about step 4: ""Come Clean."" Lack of forgiveness is a sign that I need to come clean with God myself. Remember what we said? 1) Take an inventory; 2) Accept your responsibility; 3) Ask God's forgiveness; 4) Confide in others; then 5) Confess to others. People who are forgiven are forgiving. B. Because unforgiveness just hurts me. ""To worry yourself to death with resentment would be a foolish, senseless thing to do."" - Job 5:2 (Good News) ""You are only hurting yourself with your anger."" - Job 18:4 (Good News) Unforgiveness doesn't hurt the offender, it only hurts you. Harboring unforgiveness is like trying to kill someone else by you drinking poison. Dr. S. I. McMillan in his book, ""None of These Diseases,"" says that the two greatest causes of physical problems are unresolved guilt (not receiving forgiveness) and resentment (not forgiving others). ""The verbal expression of animosity toward others calls forth certain hormones from the pituitary, adrenal, thyroid, and other glands; an excess of which can cause disease in any part of the body. Examples are: ulcers, high blood pressure, hardening of the arteries, heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, colitis, strokes, headache, arthritis, and many mental disturbances."" - Dr. S. I. McMillan This reminds of the man who told his doctor, ""I need more pills for my colitis."" The doctor said, ""Oh? Who're you colliding with now?"" It's not what you're eating that's the problem; it's what's eating you. C. Because I will need forgiveness in the future. ""But when you are praying, first forgive anyone you are holding a grudge against, so that your Father in heaven will forgive your sins, too."" - Mark 11:25 (NLT) The Bible says we can't receive what we are unwilling to give. A man once told John Wesley, ""I can never forgive that person."" Wesley said, ""Then I hope you never sin. Because we all need what you don't want to give."""
Romans 12:1-8,"('Worship', 'Family Of God', 'Community Of Faith')",Baptist," Transformation Romans 12:1-8 February 5, 2017 For the past 4 weeks we've been talking about community. We know it's important, but we often struggle with community. We get confused about how to cultivate real relationships, we struggle once we're in them, and sometimes when 2 or 3 are gathered, we make community something which is not to be desired. So, what do we do? We find community in other places. We may go to the bar. We may join a community organization, we may volunteer somewhere hoping to find what we long for. We may get involved in the church, we may even do nothing . . . or we can do what so many other people have done . . . Get involved in cyber-communities. Yup, cyber-communities are communities you find on the internet. There was Cy-World in South Korea. Cy-World was proclaimed to be a ""parallel universe unto itself. It combines aspects of 'simulated reality' computer games ... with massive multiplayer online games that have thousands of players facing off simultaneously in what's known as a 'persistent world.' Cyworld wasn't a game; the goal wasn't to slay dragons or accumulate points but to socialize with 'cybuddies.'"" The website said, Cyworld ""emphasizes relationships between relatives, neighborhood friends, and co-workers -- people who have already met in real life but yearn to also hang out online."" Don't we have that as well? We had MySpace, anyone remember that? Then we moved on to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and whatever is next. When you think about it, our world is becoming more and more impersonal. It's easier to hang out with friends in an online virtual world, than to have face-to-face interaction. We've become less interactive with family and friends. We'd rather talk to someone via texting, than to actually talk to them. When you think about the younger generation, consider the difficulties I believe they will have communicating when all they do is text, and don't really talk to one another. For those who grew up before the texting age, do you remember having a boy or girl friend. You spoke to them on the phone, as weird as it was, and as exhilirating as it was . .. You communicated and they heard your voice, and understand your humor. OK! Rant over! I once heard a story about a family where each person had a computer in his or her own bedroom, and the kids would talk to each other and to their parents using chat, instead of sitting in a room talking face-to-face. I wonder if the church has followed the ways of this world and become more virtual than real? And how can we reclaim true community and worship in the church? In Romans 12:1-8, the apostle Paul offers some practical steps for us to truly grow as a community of brothers and sisters in Christ. 1 Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God -- this is your true and proper worship. 2 Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is -- His good, pleasing and perfect will."
Acts 18:24-28,"('Apologetics', 'Gospel', 'Apollos', 'Mission')",United Methodist," Apollos the Eloquent Acts 18:24-28 Today we are introduced to Apollos, who would become part of Paul's ministry team. But who was Apollos? Let us take a look at one of the major personages of the early Christian Church and from this learn what it means for us today. A little background information will help make things more clear for us. The text says that Apollos came from Alexandria, a city in Egypt named after Alexander the Great. Alexander the Great conquered a great empire which included Palestine and Egypt. Even though he was a warrior king, he was schooled well in Greek learning by his tutor Aristotle, one of the most famous Greek philosophers and was an excellent student. Even though he was of Macedonian in origin, he was thoroughly Greek in culture. As a result of this conquest, it was his desire to spread Greek culture and learning to his entire empire. Even though Alexander died young, and his empire suffered political and military setbacks, the social change that Alexander promoted spread throughout the Mediterranean. This process of spreading Greek culture and learning was called Hellenization. The Jewish people were influenced by this Hellenization for over three hundred years. Even though various movements like that of the Maccabees rose up in opposition, the influence of the Greeks was so great that even Jerusalem had Greek-speaking synagogues. This Hellenization led to the scattering of the Jewish people throughout the world. This was not an exile caused by political setbacks, but rather a voluntary one as the opening of the Greek world to the Jews presented economic opportunities for them. They established communities everywhere including Ephesus and Alexandria. Of course, as this world opened up to the Jews, they were also introduced to Greek learning and philosophy. Others in the Greek world were also introduced to them as well. This gave the Jews opportunity to share their faith in Yahweh. The Jews were a monotheistic religion and could find some affinity with the Greek philosophers who held to some sort of monotheism as well, even if their God was an idea or could not be personally known. The Jews were asked to translate their Scriptures into Greek, and this was done by seventy Jewish scholars, probably in Alexandria. In Apollos day, there was another eloquent Alexandrian Jew named Philo Judaeus, or Philo the Jew. It is interesting to see his name is at least part Greek as the name Philo means ""friend"" or ""love"" and is part of the root for ""philosophy"" which means ""lover od wisdom."" Philo was someone who deeply wanted to make Jewish belief relevant to the Greeks as well as to keep his fellow Jews from losing their faith and being assimilated en toto to the Greek world and lose their identity. He held to the idea that the Greeks actually got many of their views from Moses, making Moses the chief of philosophers. In this presentation of Moses as a philosopher he used what is called allegorization of the Scripture. What was inspired was not the historical accounts themselves but the moral truths they taught. If Apollos lived today, his approach would be called neo-orthodox. There was a tendency then in turning Scripture into a series of myths or at least reduce the historicity of Scripture in lieu of what these sagas taught."
Romans 11:33-36,"('Glory', 'Glory Of God', 'Soli Deo Gloria')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Romans 11:33-36 Soli Deo Gloria 2/5/17 D. Marion Clark Introduction On May 7, 2000 James Montgomery Boice entered the pulpit of Tenth Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia for the final time of his 32-year ministry there as Senior Minister. He was dying of cancer. He had just enough strength to say a few words and read the opening scripture for the service. He addressed the matter of how his congregation should pray for him: ""Above all, I would say pray for the glory of God."" This was fitting for a man devoted to such a purpose. When a memorial plaque was created for him, it displayed our text. Soli Deo glory - to God alone be the glory. Let's consider this final solus of our series. Text Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! 34 ""For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?"" 35 ""Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?"" 36 For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen. The apostle Paul, who wrote these words, has been writing a long discourse on the subject of redemption, from chapter 1 to through chapter 11. He has presented the problem of sin, the solution of faith in the work of Christ, with an appendix of the place of Israel in God's plan. He concludes by breaking out in this doxology of praise to God with the final words of ""To him be glory forever."" Those words likely are spontaneous, as Paul is caught up in this moment of reflection of the wondrous ways of God. And yet, as Spock would say, they form the only logical conclusion to his discourse. For glory - the glory of God - is what life is all about. Listen to the Scriptures as they present this theme of the glory of God. Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice! Declare his glory among the nations (1 Chronicles 16:10,24) Ascribe to the LORD, O heavenly beings, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength. Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name; worship the LORD in the splendor of holiness. The voice of the LORD is over the waters; the God of glory thunders, the LORD, over many waters. and in his temple all cry, ""Glory!"" (Psalm 29:1-3, 9) I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one called to another and said: ""Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!"" (Isaiah 6:1-3) They lift up their voices, they sing for joy; over the majesty of the LORD they shout from the west. Therefore in the east give glory to the LORD; in the coastlands of the sea, give glory to the name of the LORD, the God of Israel. From the ends of the earth we hear songs of praise, of glory to the Righteous One. (Isaiah 24:14-16) I will say to the north, Give up, and to the south, Do not withhold; bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the end of the earth,"
1 Peter 3:15,"('Hope', 'Respect', ""Christ's Lordship"", 'Readiness To Witness')",Christian/Church Of Christ," The 3 C's of a Healthy Church - Always Be Ready 1 Peter 3:15 (p. 851) February 12, 2017 Introduction: A few years ago I was walking out of one of our worship services after it was over and I walked past a staff member who was having an animated conversation with a gentleman that was really upset and letting our staff member know it. I heard this comment: ""Are you telling me you financially support a ministry that involves hispanic people without making sure they are all legal?"" That got my attention...and you know me (I'm usually soft spoken and gentle and avoid controversy) . Maybe not (lol). My first question to this ""fired up"" individual was ""Are you a Christ follower?"" And after he said he was I asked ""What do you think as Christ followers should be our first concern when it comes to people...no matter their race?"" He looked at me like I was crazy and said, ""I don't get you?"" And I said, ""Our first priority should be eternity, our first priority should be God's Kingdom and His righteousness. Don't you agree?"" He got madder and said: ""If that's how you are going to use my money, I'll never give you another cent."" And I felt anger but also compassion. I remember saying...""Put first priorities first and then the Holy Spirit can guide individuals to doing what's right even if it's hard."" He said something else about not giving anymore money and I ended the conversation with ""If that's how you feel you can take your $2.50 and head down the road."" He did. The reason this conversation came to mind as I prepared this message involved the horns of a dilemma Christians are facing in the world today. How can we be Matthew 6:33 people who ""Seek first God's Kingdom and His righteousness?"" How can we be individuals who have ""revered Christ in our hearts as Lord...and are always prepared to share the hope we have...with gentleness and respect? In a world that is divided and angry. The Apostle Peter is writing to such a world in his first letter...There are individuals who view their Jewish heritage and it's laws and traditions as giving them elite status with God...and there are gentile believers who are now part of God's family...and both live under earthly authorities in this world. Peter writes: 1 PETER 1:9-17 (p. 850) If we really want to fulfill God's mission for our lives...in our world. I. RESPECT AND GENTLENESS ARE VITAL Christians who were Jewish...Christians that had been pagans...gentiles...all living under a Roman system where the Emperor of Rome was to be worshipped. Women, who before Christ, had very little authority, but now were lifted to equal salvation status...slaves and free, old and young, priests and blue collar workers. ""Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God. Once you had not received mercy but now you have received mercy...each are now together ""a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession."" (1 Peter 1:9-10)"

James has been laying out principals for us He has been drawing us a picture with dots And for the last few weeks we have been connecting those dots Last week we looked at the source of temptation in our lives And we saw how God can use the storms and wrecks that come from surrender to temptation And how Old slick can use temptations to lure us into sin But that he can only use the ammo we give him And we saw how it is our own hearts that is the source of temptation in our lives Today's message jumps right on that line of teaching James gives us practical tools for Genuine Bona Fide Christian living I need you to hear me on this The world outside those doors often sees Christians as Hypocrites Why Because we often act different than our guide book tells us we should We Read This stuff We talk about it Even preach it But we don't apply it to our lives And so when they look at a believer who does this They instantly think He ain't Bona Fide He ain't genuine So in order to help teach us how to be Bona Fide And be seen as Bona Fide James addresses so issues that are common to all humans But that are obstacles to the gospel in the lives of believers So the first thing James addresses from today's teaching is listening Notice first in verse 19 a Who he is talking or writing to ""Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters:"""
Jeremiah 1:1-19,"('Listening To God',)",Presbyterian/Reformed," The Jeremiah files. Unique Me? Unique call? Jeremiah 1New King James Version (NKJV) 1 The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, 2 to whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign. 3 It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month. 4 Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying: 5 ""Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; Before you were born I sanctified you; I ordained you a prophet to the nations."" 6 Then said I: ""Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, I cannot speak, for I am a youth."" 7 But the LORD said to me: ""Do not say, 'I am a youth,' For you shall go to all to whom I send you, And whatever I command you, you shall speak. 8 Do not be afraid of their faces, For I am with you to deliver you,"" says the LORD. 9 Then the LORD put forth His hand and touched my mouth, and the LORD said to me: ""Behold, I have put My words in your mouth. 10 See, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, To root out and to pull down, To destroy and to throw down, To build and to plant."" 11 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, ""Jeremiah, what do you see?"" And I said, ""I see a branch of an almond tree."" 12 Then the LORD said to me, ""You have seen well, for I am ready to perform My word."" 13 And the word of the LORD came to me the second time, saying, ""What do you see?"" And I said, ""I see a boiling pot, and it is facing away from the north."" 14 Then the LORD said to me: ""Out of the north calamity shall break forth On all the inhabitants of the land. 15 For behold, I am calling All the families of the kingdoms of the north,"" says the LORD; ""They shall come and each one set his throne At the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, Against all its walls all around, And against all the cities of Judah. 16 I will utter My judgments Against them concerning all their wickedness, Because they have forsaken Me, Burned incense to other gods, And worshiped the works of their own hands. 17 ""Therefore prepare yourself and arise, And speak to them all that I command you. Do not be dismayed before their faces, Lest I dismay you before them. 18 For behold, I have made you this day A fortified city and an iron pillar, And bronze walls against the whole land-- Against the kings of Judah, Against its princes, Against its priests, And against the people of the land. 19 They will fight against you, But they shall not prevail against you. For I am with you,"" says the LORD, ""to deliver you."" Ever consider a snowflake? Each snowflake is thoroughly unique - Even research has discovered it is unlikely to find two alike. We too are thoroughly unique - even among identical twins incredible individual Characteristics occur. Personality and individual dreams occur. Calls are important - God has a unique call on each persons life and that call is often revealed to be very long term."
Acts 6:4,"('Word Of God', 'Mission Of Church', 'Ministry Of The Word', 'Impact Of The Word')",Christian/Church Of Christ," 1. You are flying at 30,000 feet. Which wing of the airplane do you think is more important, the right or left? BOTH, of course! Welcome to Biblical thinking; both-and rather than either/or 2. The same is true in our walk with God - Acts 6.4 a. The problem solved with servants so the apostles could maintain their priority b. Some - focus so much on prayer they leave the word of God off - 2 Chronicles 7.14 c. Some so focus on the word of God they miss the impact of prayer - 2 Timothy 4.2 (preach word. . .) 3. To be genuine, God-led people, we must be prayer-centered and word-focused to know and do 4. The explosive growth of the early church a. Did not come from: "" Good planning and methodology - Acts 1.8; Matthew 28.18-20 "" A sizeable ministry budget "" High Profile Superstar leaders "" Fancy Worship Centers "" Technology and Social Media b. Rather, It came from: "" Supernatural presence of God and His Spirit "" Where people cooperated with the presence and priorities of God "" Supernatural results - Acts 6.7; 122.24; 19.8-20 - ""And the word of God continued to increase,"" 5. Let's explore the ""Ministry/Mission"" of God's Word I. The Internal Mission - Make our character like God's - conformed to the image of his son (Romans 8.29) By the living, powerful Word of God (Hebrews 4.12) A. The Word of God Works as a Fire - Jeremiah 5.14; 20.9 (word in heart as fire) Silver, Refining Malachi 3:3 says: ""He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver."" This verse puzzled some women in a Bible study and they wondered what this statement meant about the character and nature of God. One of the women called a silversmith and made an appointment to watch him at work. She didn't mention anything about the reason for her interest beyond her curiosity about the process of refining silver. As she watched the silversmith, he held a piece of silver over the fire and let it heat up. He explained that in refining silver, one needed to hold the silver in the middle of the fire where the flames were hottest as to burn away all the impurities. The woman thought about God holding us in such a hot spot. She asked the silversmith if it was true that he had to sit there in front of the fire the whole time the silver was being refined. The man answered that yes, he not only had to sit there holding the silver, but he had to keep his eyes on the silver the entire time it was in the fire. If the silver was left a moment too long in the flames, it would be destroyed. The woman was silent for a moment. Then she asked the silversmith, ""How do you know when the silver is fully refined?"" He smiled at her and answered, ""Oh, that's easy - when I see my image in it."" If today you are feeling the heat of the fire, remember that God has His eye on you and will keep watching you until He sees His image in you. B. The Word of God Works as a Sword (to reveal our sins and direct us) What shall we say then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! On the contrary, I would not have known sin except through the law. For I would not have known covetousness unless the law had said, ""You shall not covet."" Romans 7:7"

I. Lost People Matter to God A. This was Jesus' third and final trip through Jericho 1. No doubt Zacchaeus had heard of Jesus before but just lingered in the shadows watching to see if He was consistent. 2. Lost people watch our lives to see if we live what we profess... B. The Bible says that he was both short and rich. 1. In the simplest of terms this story communicates to us that it doesn't matter to God what you look like and it doesn't matter to Him how much money you have or do not have..

Luke 19:7 Luke 6:26 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets. A. A critical spirit has stopped a lot of people from living for the Lord. 2 Timothy 3:5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. How can you say the love of God dwells in you if you say you love God but hate your brother? 1. When we wear the name of Christ we need to make sure we represent well. 2. A critical spirit makes Christ unattractive to the lost 3. A critical spirit is a spiritual battle (Rev. 12:10 refers to satan as the ""accuser of the brethren) 4. When we all the critical spirit to invade our lives we become religious and enter into a partnership with satan to tear down God's work in the earth. B. You can overcome a critical spirit Philippians 4:8 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. 1. We need to guard against a critical spirit (every time someone says something bad about someone reciprocate by sharing three things good about that person) III. Luke 10:8 Effects of the New Birth. A. Salvation does not exempt a person from righting the wrongs of the past. 1. God pardons us (eternally) but society does not. B. Zacchaeus did not desire to repay those he had wronged because of condemnation, his motivation was the love of God. 1. When God's love enters our hearts it motivates us to do what is right. 2. The desire to right ones wrongs is one of the evidences of true salvation. IV. Luke 19:9-10 - God Cares About Your Family A. Jesus declared that salvation had come ""to Zacchaeus's house"". 1. God loves the family unit. (Husbands, wives, children, grandparents, aunt, uncles and cousins...) 2. As men we have a responsibility to lead our families in the ways of the Lord (quit leaving it to the women... We need to love them and lead them) B. Jesus declared to both Zacchaeus' house and to His critics, ""The Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost."" 1. Seek - specifically (by Hebraism) to worship (God): be (go) about, desire, endeavour, enquire (for), require, (X will) seek (after, for, means)."
Mark 5:21-34,"('Faith', 'Perseverance', 'Sanctification', 'Healing By Jesus')",Evangelical Free," Let us worship our God now by listening to His sacred Word, the story of Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in the Gospel of Mark. Open your Bibles to Mark 5............... Let us read and listen carefully to what our Creator God wants to tell us; Mark 5:21-34.......... Today, we will focus on the healed woman. We will come back to Jairus and his daughter next week. Now in order to better understand what happened with the healed woman and what we need to learn from it, we need to grasp the details. We must always read God's Word in context of the passage, in context of the chapter, in context of the book, and in context with the whole Bible! God will not contradict himself in His Word; on the contrary, God explains Himself in the entire Bible! v21-24: Jesus is now well known and there were always a crowd pressing on Him. Now, from v25-26, what can we say about the woman?? The woman should have been dead already! She had a messy incurable disease, had nothing, and was in agony! Now, we don't know her background but this woman was in so much pain and in need. Does God, did Jesus Christ, knew this woman and her needs?? Hebrews 4:13 tells us, Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account. Nothing is hidden from God! God knows every person and every single thing about a person! God and Jesus Christ knew exactly who the woman and her situation! Hebrews 4:13 Now look again at v27-28... What can we say what she heard about Jesus?? "" Jesus was going to be there! "" Jesus has power to heal! "" Jesus is God (all she had to do was touch His clothes)! v29...... Lets briefly ponder about the situation: There was a crowd and Jesus was being touched by all sorts of people, but Jesus knew exactly who this woman was and her intent. Likely there were many people touching Jesus wanting something! Why do you think Jesus healed her?? The answer is in v34... Jesus was again teaching about faith! We already noted that Jesus Christ is God and He knows every person! But yet.... v30-32: Why did Jesus stop to find out who the woman was?? Since Jesus was again teaching about faith, Jesus was looking for a personal confession from the woman! Faith requires a response! And so we note in v33-34: Jesus did not tell the woman what healed her until she confessed and humbled herself before the Lord. Here's what Luke 8:47-48 states: Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. Then he said to her, ""Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace."" Jesus called the woman ""daughter"" and wished her peace and continued healing! Do we desire to be called a child of God; to have peace and continued healing? What can we learn from the woman?? 1. She found out where Jesus was and went there! Do we know where Jesus is and desire to be beside Him? 2. She believed Jesus is God and has power to heal! Do we believe that Jesus Christ is our only God and Savior?"
2 Corinthians 4:3-6,"('Spiritual Death', 'Blind Life')",Baptist," ARE YOU BLINDED BY SATAN? It's sad to say but there are thousands of people in the world today that are spiritually blind. They just can't see the Grace of God and his goodness. 2nd Corinthians 4: 3 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: 4 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. 5 For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. 6 For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. (1) He blinds people. Remember God's mercies are with us daily. Lamentations 3: 22 It is of the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. 23 They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness. Too many people ignore his mercies. Romans 2: 4 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? 5 But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; We in America have been blessed (we have freedom prospered) (2) Most men are blind to their spiritual condition. They look smell bad. He makes man think he is ok from outward appearance they don't see the inner man. Matthew 23: 27 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. 28 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. God looks on the heart. Not the body. (a)Look at the lost man. He is a sinner. Romans 3: 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Our best is as filthy rags. He is under the wrath. Sin-hating John 3: 36 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. (3) He blinds men to the truth of the way of salvation. Satan does not want men to believe the Gospel of Christ. Because the Gospel is good news to the lost person. Romans 5: 6 For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. 7 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. The gospel is the power of God unto salvation. The gospel will transform Satan's followers to a follower of Almighty God. The Philippians jailer. Satan blinds men to brevity of life .The certainty of judgement. The word of God tells us."
Luke 22:31-32,"('Sift', 'Sifting', 'Positioning')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Where are my people? For those who have Bibles... Luke 22:31-32 - ""And The Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not: and when you are converted, strengthen your brethren."" God works with me thru questions.... Where are my people? The ones who have been sifted and came through. Revivals are really not for the unsaved, but those who profess salvation..... So, I want to give you a question to ponder; at this time in your life, is what you are doing, what you are supposed to be doing? In other words, are you walking in your divine destiny? To thine own self, be true I don't know if anybody else is paying attention or not, but the world is in shock and has been shocked on many fronts. There are the terrorists attacks from various religious fanatics, suicide bombers, not just Isis. There have been earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding, a continuous increase in senseless killings. Our government has made and is still making/creating laws that are clearly against the word of God. There are so many people in this world who are homeless, hungry and living in impoverished conditions. This is not happening only in other parts of the world, it is happening right here in America. I read somewhere that here in this country alone that there are 10 empty houses to every homeless person. And we say that we live in the best part of the world. The land of plenty. The church, over the past couple of decades have been literally slapped in the face by the enemy so much so that we should be puking. And, I believe thru all of that, that God is asking the question; ""where are my people? As a body of believers, we know that we are here on purpose and with purpose. You remember the word The Lord gave to Jeremiah, I knew you... He has said the same thing to each of you. Jeremiah call was to be a prophet to the nations. Each of us has a call, a work to do for the kingdom of God. Not only that, We say it in our prayers, let Your will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. And, His will is done thru us, spirit beings. Remember, we are spirit beings housed in bodies of dust to carry out the will of God here on the Earth. So when things get out of order here on Earth, we have been commissioned / assigned to correct it. We are to create an Earth that is conducive for the King of glory to come and make His abode with us. In our quoted passage of scripture, Jesus had completed the last supper with His disciples and He began to further instruct them. He eventually turns to Peter and says Simon, Simon, satan has desired to have you.... How many of you know that satan has to have permission to touch your life. Remember Job? (Expound) Not only that, we give him permission when we don't know who we are. ~~~satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat...... Sifting wheat was the process of separating the kernels of grain from the ""chaff"", that held them. Jesus said, ""Simon, satan wants to sift you and prove that you are nothing but chaff - Satan wants to convince you that you are worthless."""

"" It is strongly recommended that you purchase and become familiar with Michael Behe's book, Darwin's Black Box, before you get to that lesson later in the study. INTRODUCTION Beginning today we want to look at what is technically known as THEOLOGY. Q. Can someone give me a definition of the word ""theology."" A. The word theology comes from two Greek words: Theos, meaning ""God"" Logos, meaning ""word"" in its basic form, but when logos is combined with other words, it means ""teaching"" or ""doctrine."" Put theos and logos together and it means ""the teaching or doctrine of God."" In a broad sense theology refers to the entire study of Bible doctrine. In this sense, all Bible doctrines is a study in theology. Preachers go to a theological seminary to study theology, meaning they go to study all about the Christian faith in general, or all that the Bible teaches in general. But in a narrower sense, the word theology refers specifically to the study of the doctrine of God Himself. It is in this latter sense that we will study theology--the doctrine of God. In this restricted sense, we will examine God's existence, His attributes, His nature, His names and His works. So we begin our study of theology by examining THE EXISTENCE OF GOD. We no longer live in an age where the existence of God is taken for granted. In former times people debated such questions as ""What is God like?"" or ""How many gods are there?"" That there was a god or gods was tacitly assumed by almost everyone. That is no longer true today. Our age has been called ""the age of skepticism."" Belief in God is no longer considered necessary or, increasingly, even desirable. Christian THINKERS do not dominate the world of philosophy as they once did. Christian ART is no longer the focal point of cultural expression. SCIENCE is no longer populated by theists with an reverent awe of God's creation. Since scientists cannot find evidence that can be scientifically measured about some being who lives outside of our physical senses, many assume He must not exist. God has not been discovered in a test tube or a telescope. Years ago, the Soviet cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, commented after orbiting the earth, ""I didn't see any God out there."""
Revelation 14:14-20,"(""God's Wrath"", 'Wrath Of God', 'Golden Crown', 'Sharp Sickle')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 12/30/16 Title: Reaping the Earth's Harvest, and the Grapes of Wrath (14:14-20) Series: Verse By Verse Through Revelations Revelation 14:14-20 (KJV) 14 And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle. 15 And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. 16 And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped. 17 And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. 18 And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. 19 And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God. 20 And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs. Introduction (14:14-16) The Lord's great parable of the wheat and the tares casts light on this harvest. Satan sows his tares among the wheat, and both wheat and tares grows together until the day of harvest. In the early stages, Satan's tares are so much like the wheat that it is hard to tell them apart. But that is no longer the case! The black, ugly darnel[1] stands now in stark contrast with the golden grain of the wheat. The good seed and the bad are revealed by their fruits, and the time has come to separate the one from the other forever. The tares are to be bundled for the fire, and the wheat is to be harvested and stored in the barn of the millennial earth. (14:17-20) The harvest is all about Christendom--or what is left of it, for the sphere of the harvest is religious. The vintage[2] has to do with the world and the mention of it makes it clear that the time of God's vengeance has come. The harvest depicts the final separation of the false from the true; the vintage describes the final subjugation of the foes of the truth. The vintage pictures the Lord stepping down into the arena of Armageddon to trample down the beast and all those gathered to his standard in this final conflict of the age. Commentary This is a judgment scene; for John sees ""one like unto the Son of Man""[5] all set to separate the faithful from the unfaithful. This will be a time of joy for Christians who have been persecuted and martyred because they will receive their own long awaited reward. Christians should not fear the Last Judgment. Jesus said, ""Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life."" (John 5:24)."
Ephesians 1:15-20,"('Paul', 'Church', 'Prayer', 'Maturity', 'Spiritual Maturity')",Brethren," BEING THE CHURCH THAT PRAYS Ephe 1:15-20 I. THANKFUL: INCREASING BURDEN TO PRAY "" As a church and "" For the church. 1. FOR MATURITY "" That our hearts would be gripped by God. "" That our eyes would catch the eternal; and "" That our lives would reach its full purpose in Christ. 2. THE LORD SAID IN MT 21:13 "" 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' 3. ""A CHURCH THAT PRAYED"" "" This is our prayer isn't it? "" That we would be in our times that church that prayed. 4. THE CHURCH IN THE BOOK OF ACTS WAS A CHURCH THAT PRAYED\ i. Acts 1:13; 2:1. The 120 praying in one accord for 10 days. [On the Day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit came upon them]. ii. Acts 4:24, 31.

Five young college students were spending a Sunday in London, so they went to hear the famed C.H. Spurgeon preach. While waiting for the doors to open, the students were greeted by a man who asked, ""Gentlemen, let me show you around. Would you like to see the heating plant of this church?"" They were not particularly interested, for it was a hot day in July. But they didn't want to offend the stranger, so they consented. The young men were taken down a stairway, a door was quietly opened, and their guide whispered, ""This is our heating plant."" Surprised, the students saw 700 people bowed in prayer, seeking a blessing on the service that was soon to begin in the auditorium above. Softly closing the door, the gentleman then introduced himself. It was none other than Charles Spurgeon. II.

Mark 1:14-15,"('Belief', 'Repentance', 'Kingdom Of God')",Foursquare," The Kingdom of God ""The Kingdom Proclamation"" Mark 1:14-15 Many people have been trying to connect the dots in their lives. Their lives and understanding of Christianity have been a series of seemingly unconnected dots, like those children's pictures but without a key as to which color to draw, or without the numbers to connect the dots allowing the picture to make sense. In today's church we have all these talking points. We talk on salvation, repentance, heaven, hell, and other great themes of the Bible, along with practical advice taught in God's word. But people are still confused because these are singular points with no connecting thread. This morning I want to present the connective thread that ties them all together into a collective whole, into a picture and connect the dots. The thread is The Kingdom of God. Over the next couple of months, in our Sunday Evening Service we'll be looking at many of the misperceptions and misunderstandings people have concerning the Kingdom of God. And this isn't anything new. This has been going on for a long time. This morning we're kicking off our Sunday night series with a message entitled, ""The Kingdom Proclamation."" Tonight we'll be looking at ""The First Priority."" The writer of Hebrews says we're receiving a kingdom that cannot be moved; that while everything else around us is being shaken to the ground; we have a kingdom that cannot be shaken. It's important, therefore, that we understand what this kingdom is, and that we live within it so when life gets out of control we can stand on the solid rock of Jesus Christ. Only then when the wind and waves of life come crashing down we can survive, firm in our belief and hope. This morning we're going to start off by looking at what Mark gives us at the very beginning of his gospel. It's a kind of summary of the whole message he's unfolding. In our passage he introduces it. ""Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came to Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and saying, 'The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel.'"" (Mark 1:14-15 NKJV) Mark begins his gospel with this announcement saying, ""The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God."" (Mark 1:1 NKJV) Mark then gives us a glimpse of the ministry of John the Baptist, the last of the Old Testament prophets who was the forerunner and herald of Jesus' arrival. As John the Baptist ministry was closing, Jesus came not preaching repentance, although it was an integral part of the message; rather He came preaching the Kingdom of God, and then the need for the people to repent and believe. That is what I like to call our attention to because it is a perfect summary of Christianity and what it stands for, as well as the message of what the Gospel really is all about. The reason I am starting here in this series is not just because this is where Jesus started, which in itself is sufficient, but also because there's nothing that is so desperately needed in our world as a simple and direct statement of the gospel of Jesus Christ."
Mark 1:14-15,"('Preaching', 'Kingdom Of God', 'Kingdom Proclamation', 'The Time Is Fulfilled')",Foursquare," The Kingdom of God ""The Kingdom Proclamation"" Mark 1:14-15 Many people have been trying to connect the dots in their lives.

Matthew 6:33,"('Priorities', 'Kingdom Of God', 'Priority')",Foursquare," The Kingdom of God ""The First Priority"" Matthew 6:33 We began this new study this morning on the Kingdom of God in the message entitled, ""The Kingdom Proclamation."" The reason for this series is that we have all these different subjects within Christianity but nothing that seemingly connects them together. We teach on salvation, justification, redemption, sanctification, atonement, heaven, hell, evil, faith, grace, mercy, hope, idolatry, judgment, obedience, and the list just keeps on going. But these are just dots on a page with nothing to seemingly connect them, nothing to reveal the picture of God's overall plan and purpose. Yet, in the Bible there is one connective thread that brings all of these together into a beautiful picture, and that is the Kingdom of God. This morning we looked at the proclamation of God's Kingdom that the time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Therefore we're to repent, and believe in the gospel. (Mark 1:15) Tonight we'll be looking at what Jesus said, that God's Kingdom should be our first priority. ""But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. (Matthew 6:33 NKJV) Jesus here brings to a head what He had been teaching about in our need not to worry or be anxious about what the world worries or is anxious about. It's a part of a much larger sermon Jesus gave known as the Sermon on the Mount. During the course of the Sermon Jesus make this general statement summing up His whole position, which is the essence of the Christian message. Now the reason we're exploring this so intently is because of the tragic and terrible confusion that exists about God's Kingdom and Christianity, because if we take our understanding from what the newspapers and books say, then we're in one big mess. In His Sermon on the Mount, Jesus gives us the essentials of the very proclamation Jesus stated and that we looked at this morning. There are, however, several general principles that Jesus brings out in His statement that cannot be overlooked. The first is that the gospel message is completely different than anything and everything else. It's completely different from what humanity thinks and believes is important, and challenges what humanity believes. Notice what Jesus said just prior to this ""Therefore do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' For after all these things the Gentiles seek."" (Matthew 6:31-32a NKJV) In Judaism the world is divided into two groups, the Jews and everyone else, those who have the right religion and those who don't, and those who live by God's law and those who live outside of it. And so you have the Jews and the Gentiles. The Gentiles in our day are those who don't know God as revealed in the Bible. They trust in religion or their own thoughts and ideas about God and life. And so what Jesus teaches is altogether different than their point of view. His teaching is different from everything that man has ever thought."

Romans 8:5-10,"('Unity', ""God's Spirit"", 'Power Of God')",Christian/Church Of Christ," THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THE LIFE OF A CHRISTIAN Someone has said, ""You will never truly know the power of God until you need the power of God."" I think that statement equally applies to God's Holy Spirit. As we mentioned earlier in this series, too often Christians and churches do not seek nor even rely on God's Spirit in daily living. American independence has taught us to ""do it yourself"" and then if you encounter problems ask for help. But, that is not God's plan nor preference. Also, our restoration heritage, with men like Alexander Campbell and his Baconian rationalism has steeped us in mentally formulating our rules of thinking. Since Campbell's death, our fellowship has largely followed tradition at the expense of seeking the heart of Christ in our thinking and actions. Barton W. Stone, a pioneer in the American Restoration Movement, believed in and was led more by the Holy Spirit than any other person, I suppose. The Cane Ridge meeting was a Communion like no other. On Friday, August 6, 1801 an estimated 20,000 people rode or walked into the remote outpost of Cane Ridge, KY. Men, women and children moved from one preaching venue to another, watching, praying, preaching, weeping, groaning, and falling. Though some stood at the edges and mocked, most left marveling at the wondrous hand of God. The Cane Ridge Communion quickly became one of the best-reported events in American history, and according to Vanderbilt historian Paul Conkin, ""arguably ... the most important religious gathering in all of American history."" It ignited the explosion of evangelical religion, which soon reached into nearly every corner of American life. For decades the prayer of camp meetings and revivals across the land was ""Lord, make it like Cane Ridge ."" The unusual events of Cane Ridge fanned the flames of what was known in America as the Great Awakening. What was it about Cane Ridge that gripped the imagination? Exactly what happened? . . . Europeans visiting the American wilderness and encountering a revival firsthand were convinced that Americans had gone mad. But the excitement was evident far beyond the emotional fervor of the camp meetings. For a brief period from 1832-1849 there was both an appeal for unity and an effort to have unity between all religious beliefs. There was an increased interest in the Bible, evangelism and conversion. However, the appeal for unity led to heated debates and schisms. Disagreements become so sharp that divisions occurred down party lines and creeds became more important that the appeal to God's Word. In recent days, water-boarding is back in the news. I find it interesting that a form of this was used in the early days of religion in this country. Here is a picture of what happened to those who disagreed with another parties views. In the very appeal for and attempt at unity, religious denomination flourished and unity and the Holy Spirit got pushed to the outer margins of religious thought and practice."

Psalms 34:18-19,"('Hopelessness', 'Rejection', 'Pain And Suffering', 'Broken And Hurt')",Assembly Of God," Introduction: There is lot of suffering and pain in this world that we are living in. Maybe you have been diagnosed with sickness or you lost your job or a loved one passed away or your prayers are taking a long time to be answered. Despite doing your best, your condition is the same. On one side you are God's child, doing everything the best you can but on the other side, you don't have an answer to the pain you are going through. You are asking to ""Where is God when it hurts?"" Illustration: I remember as a young boy I wrote a very competitive exam and I had a lot of plans laid up after I finish the exams. I went and took prospectus from different universities and planned for a great career only to realize that I failed in one subject that too for the subject I studied well with one marks. My world had come to an end and I had no answer why. I remember another time after having settled in a good work in Bangalore, I resigned just because I got a great an opportunity to work in Singapore. I was selected out of many people. I got the appointment letter from one of the reputed firms in Singapore. I surrendered my passport and paid my visa and work permit charges, only to find out a couple of weeks later that my visa had been rejected because of government policies. My dreams shattered. I did not know why? I never got any answer why I was going through hardships? Maybe you are having the same question today - Where is God when it hurts? Many people think that God has given them a tough life, whereas some others are having an easy life. Sometimes we feel that we suffer far more than others. But this is simply not the case, everyone has unique troubles. Your friends may not have the same trouble as yours; you may not have the same problems as mine. Everyone has their own share of struggle but the Lord has promised to be with us and deliver us from all our troubles. Psalm 34:19 18The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. 19A righteous man may have many troubles, but the Lord delivers him from them all. In the Bible, from Abraham to David to Apostle John, all were afflicted, all were in trouble, yet all came out of their trouble as heroes of faith, stronger, and higher. It does not mean that God enjoys putting us through trials. In the world of sin we are living in, there is pain but God will deliver the righteous out of it. 1. God tests our heart in our hurts. Do we believe and trust God even in the midst of pain and suffering? Do we believe in the promises of God even when everything looks impossible? Do we trust in God even when we do not understand His ways in our lives? Our trials can be a test of our faith. Deuteronomy 8:2 Remember how the Lord your God led you all the way in the desert these forty years, to humble you and to test you in order to know what was in your heart, whether or not you would keep his commands. Every trial the Israelites went through from the Red Sea to the Promised Land was a test of their faith; God was testing their heart whether they would be faithful to him."
1 John 2:15-17,"('Biblical', 'Biblical Values', 'Priority', 'Spiritual Priorities', 'Establish Priorities')",Assembly Of God," http://www.cityharvestagchurch.org/category/sermons-and-sermon-series/prioritize-your-life/ Every person has their own priorities and values in life. Our values set our priorities. It determines where you spend your effort and time. We pick up our values basically from what we are constantly exposed to - like our childhood experiences, our family upbringing, our education, our friends, our neighborhood, our workplace environment etc. So at the end of the day it is we who chose and decide the source of our values. Illustration: The children of Israel had been taken captive into Babylon. Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were chosen among the captives to stand before the king. The king had appointed them a daily portion of his meat and wine for them to drink. However, Daniel and friends did not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat. He knew he was a Hebrew, he knew his values. So Daniel chose to stand by his values which set up his priorities in life. So how do you set your priorities right for the New Year 2017? 1. Choose the source of your values. What is the source of your values? Where are you getting them from? Have you made values and principles in your life based on the world outside or have you made values and principles of your life based on the Word of God? It is important where I get my values from, because my values determine how successful I am. Illustration: Some people get their values out of television. They spent hours and hours in front of that box and eventually their life gets molded by what they see in the TV. This influences their behaviour, choices, hairstyle, clothing, dialogues etc. There are some who get their values from their friends. You can just look at a person and just know his friends because friends share the same values. ""Birds of the same feather flock together."" That is why it is very important to have good friends. There are some who get their values from the internet, the Google. Google is not the Bible. If you spend on average 2 hours everyday in front of the TV and 2 hours on internet in a year you would have spent 1500 hours seeing TV and internet. It means by the time you are 70 years old you spend 16 years watching television and internet. On the other hand if you are a Sunday believer you come to church for 1-1/2 hours a week. So in one year you are 78 hours in the church if you come all Sundays. By the time you are 70 years you spend only 8 months in church. Psalms 119:37 Turn my eyes away from worthless things; preserve my life according to your word. 'Turn my eyes away from worthless things' would be a good verse to put on your TV set. Therefore as people of God we are largely exposed more to the world outside than with God and the presence of God. So there is a great chance that we will be molded and exposed as to what morality is, what decency is, what integrity is and what our values are by what we see on the TV rather than by the Bible. Listen, if you want success, if you want to prioritize your life, if you want God to use you we need to differentiate between the worldly values and the biblical values."
2 Peter 3:18,"('Seek Ye First', 'Priority', 'Church Priorities', 'Spiritual Priorities')",Assembly Of God," http://www.cityharvestagchurch.org/category/sermons-and-sermon-series/prioritize-your-life/ Misplaced priority Joke: Surprised to see an empty seat at the world cup football final stadium, a diehard fan asked the woman sitting nearby whose seat it was. ""It was my husband's,"" the woman explained, ""But he died."" ""I'm very sorry,"" said the man. ""Yet I'm really surprised that you still love him and you even did not give another relative a chance to take the seat reserved for him."" The woman said. ""They all insisted on going to my husband's funeral."" Misplaced priority Joke: A man brought a brand new BMW and parked it in on the main road in front of his office to show it off to his colleagues. As he was getting out of the car, a lorry comes speeding too close to the car and takes off the door before zooming off. The man gets very angry, takes out his mobile and calls the police. The police arrives and immediately calls the ambulance. The man starts screaming, ""My car, my BMW. It is ruined. No matter how they repair, it will never be the same again."" The police said, ""Hey man, you are so focused on your possessions that you don't notice anything else in life."" The man shouts to the police, ""How can you say such a thing at a time like this?"" The police replies, ""Didn't you realize that your right arm was torn off when the truck hit you?"" This man looks down in horror and says, ""Oh! My God, my Rolex watch."" Introduction: Most of us are in the place we are in because of misplaced priorities. You went to a driving school but cannot drive. You started the piano classes but you can hardly play any note. You started a course and could not complete. They never give their 100% and they lose. I tell you today, if you can prioritize your life, you can be far more successful and blessed than you are today. Last week we saw that our priority must be based on our spiritual values than worldly values. Today I want to start the message with giving you the top three priorities in one's life. Prioritize your spiritual growth. 2 Peter 3:18 Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Illustration: That great missionary to India, William Carey, became deeply concerned about the attitude of his son Felix. The young man, a professing Christian, had promised to become a missionary. But he broke his vow when he was appointed ambassador to Burma. Carey requested prayer for him: ""Pray for Felix. He has degenerated into an ambassador of the British government when he should be serving the King of kings."" Have you been giving more importance to anything other than God? How is your spiritual growth? How long have you been a Christian? Does your spiritual maturity correspond to your chronological age in Christ? How passionate are you to move from where you are spiritually to the next level of spiritual maturity this year?"
Matthew 17:1-8,"('Salvation', 'Power', 'Transfiguration', 'Presence Of God', 'Gift Of Salvation')",Baptist," In Matthew 17:4, Peter speaks to the Lord during the transfiguration and says these words, ""...Lord, it is good for us to be here:..."". Why was it good for them to be there? I want to take a few reasons why I believe it was good for them to be there and apply them to reasons why it is good for us to be in the house of the Lord. It's Good For Us To Be Here because of: I) THE POWER OF GOD - (vs 2) ""And was transfigured before them:..."" The power of God was on full display on the mount. In the house of God we can also see the power of God. a) A Healing Power - (Mark 5, 7, 10; John 11) b) A Saving Power - (I Peter 1:5; Romans 4:21) II) THE PRONOUNCEMENT OF GOD - (vs 5) ""...hear ye him."" The voice of God was speaking clearly to the disciples on the mount. In the house of God, God speaks to us through his word. His word speaks of a) A Savior's Passion - (John 3:16; Romans 5:8) b) A Savior's Purpose - (Luke 19:10; I Timothy 1:5) c) A Savior's Promise - (John 14:1-3; Acts 1:11; Titus 2:13) III) THE PRESENCE OF GOD - (vs 7) ""And Jesus came and touched them,..."" The disciples were in the presence of God on the mount. When we come to church with the right heart and attitude, we are in the presence of God. The bible says in Matthew 18:20, ""For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them."" a) An Unfailing Presence - (Hebrews 13:5) b) An Unchanging Presence - (Hebrews 13:8; Malachi 3:6)"
2 Kings 6:1-7,"('Discipleship', 'Miracles', 'Social', 'Physics')",Independent/Bible," Getting Your Axe Together (2 Kings 6:1-7) 1. A saw mill advertises for a timber worker. A skinny little bloke shows up at the camp the next day carrying an axe. The head timber worker takes one look at the puny bloke and tells him to get lost. ""Give me a chance to show you what I can do,"" says the little guy. ""Okay, see that giant redwood over there?"" says the foreman. ""Take your axe and cut it down."" The little bloke heads for the tree and in five minutes he's knocking on the foreman's door. ""I cut the tree down,"" says the bloke. The foreman can't believe his eyes and says,""Where did you learn to chop down trees like that?"" ""In the Great Australian Forest,"" says the little fella. ""You mean the Great Australian Desert,"" says the foreman. ""Sure! That's what they call it now!"" source: http://www.jokebuddha.com 2. Today, we have an account that centers around similar themes: an axe and cutting down trees. And Elisha works a miracle involving an axe. 3. Elisha's miracle and the events surrounding it demonstrate God's concern for our problems and the importance of being in fellowship with one another as we struggle through life's problems together. Main Idea: God wants us to have hearts that are concerned about others, especially fellow believers. We see three principles that help us do so. I. The Way to Develop Disciples is By PARTICIPATION (1-3). ?Jewish translation of ""sons of the prophets"" is often ""disciples of the prophets."" ? ""Moving to the Jordan River is a big deal. In the previous story, the Syrian general Naaman was healed from leprosy by immersing himself in the Jordan River. Before Elijah is taken up to heaven in a whirlwind, him and Elisha travel from Gilgal to the Jordan River (II Kings 2:1-6). After Elijah goes up to heaven, Elisha splits the waters of the Jordan River (2:14) and then travels to Jerico until he finally ends up in Gilgal (4:38), effectively retracing Elijah's steps on his final journey."" [hermeneutics.stackexchange.com] ?Someone has called this chapter the first example of a college campus in the Bible. A. CONNECTED people are influential people. 1. We are created as social beings. We will not be happy in isolation. The social parts of our brain usually becomes activated 2 days after birth. 2. We are to grow in the Lord partly through social experiences. The church is not the convergence of believers who merely sit side by side, but believers interacting with God and one another. 3. How social and connected we are varies. Both connected. Elijah needed more time alone; Elisha, like Jesus, is among the disciples and more social. 4. All need the social, but some of us more than others. Marylu and I are glad when we can stay home an evening; Jane Soblotne -- who wants to be home? B. A common HUMANITY is more effective than a lofty distance. 1. We may prefer controlled environments, but God sometimes does not. 2. Elisha is right there with the disciples in this effort; they needed him. 3. Some spiritual lessons are best learned during more secular pursuits."
Genesis 6:1-8,"('Invitation', 'Wickedness', 'Solution', 'Repercussion')",Baptist," WICKEDNESS That INVITES REPERCUSSION-VI--Genesis 6:1-8 Attention: Wash the Dishes Pleeease! A young man called his mother & announced excitedly that he had just met a young lady at church who was of true Christian character & virtue. He was so thrilled, he could hardly contain himself. But he hadn't asked her out on a date yet, so he asked his mother what he should do. His mother had an idea, knowing that her son was an excellent cook: ""Why don't you send her flowers, & on the card invite her to your apartment for a home-cooked meal?"" He thought this was a great strategy. He made his roommates aware of the situation so they would behave themselves. And a week later, the woman came to dinner. His mother called the next day to see how things had gone. He moaned, ""I was totally humiliated."" ""She insisted on washing the dishes."" His mother asks, ""What's wrong with that? Your father & I have some of our best conversations while washing dishes together."" Her son dejectedly replied, ""We hadn't started eating yet!"" There are things we may do or not do, that circumvent/destroy our best intentions. Self-service, self-love, & flesh-driven feeling wreak havoc on us & others. In Noah's day the majority of humanity did not consider, &/or were indifferent towards, or were openly malicious toward their Creator. Likewise today, when Christ is considered inconsequential to a person's or a nation's life, vitally important matters are treated as though they were of little worth. Simultaneously, other things become elevated to the place of indispensability, taking Christ's place as Head. If we are not vigilant to honor Christ, we find ourselves making great sacrifices for that which has no eternal value, for the sake of temporal satisfaction.

This destruction would not only effect man but animals as well. All creatures are dependent upon man for the fullness of their existence. All nature/creation is thus inextricably tied to mankind's resolve/decision/choice!(Rom. 8:18-22) Rom. 8:18-23--""For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God.

Matthew 14:25-32,"('Faith In Action', 'Acting Upon Faith', 'Belief In Action')",Baptist," I. Introduction A. What would be the best message for the first of the New Year? 1. I'm sure that every preacher has an answer for that question 2. And like me, probably, its different from year to year B. Just about a month ago we were watching John MacArthur one Sunday Evening and he was talking about Peter's trip on the water. 1. Turn to Luke 17:5 2. MacArthur's message was not like this one, but it put the story in my recent memory 3. Then a few weeks ago I was talking to some one and they told me that their faith was not where they wanted it to be, they asked me how to increase their faith as the apostles asked in Luke 17:5 Luke 17:5 (NKJV) And the apostles said to the Lord, ""Increase our faith."" a. What flashed through my mind was Peter and walking on the water and I told this individual, ""Get out of the boat."" b. Imagine that individual asking, ""How can I increase my faith?"" And me saying, ""Get out of the boat."" c. The look on their face was quite amusing (1) Lets turn to Matthew 14:25-32 and read this incident Matthew 14:25-32 (NKJV) Now in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea. {26} And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, ""It is a ghost!"" And they cried out for fear. {27} But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, ""Be of good cheer! It is I; do not be afraid."" {28} And Peter answered Him and said, ""Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water."" {29} So He said, ""Come."" And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus. {30} But when he saw that the wind was boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, ""Lord, save me!"" {31} And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him, and said to him, ""O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"" {32} And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased. II. Body A. What I see in this story 1. First, this is a real incident, not a parable 2. However, we can look at this as a kind of parable a. The raging lake water is life in this old world of ours (1) Stepping out into the water we have two alternatives (2) It takes courage to step into the water and when we do step into the water we can (a) Sink (b) Or swim (c) Or in Peter's case walk on the water (3) It takes courage to leave our little houses in the morning (a) Or to begin to engage in the daily grind, what ever that might be (4) When we leave our little house in the morning we must sink or swim (a) Or we must keep our eyes on Jesus and walk on water (5) The alternative is to stay home (a) Stay in bed, pull the covers up over our head and hide from the world (b) There are times that is the thing to do, in all practicality that is because of i) Blizzards ii) Tornados iii) You know, adverse weather iv) And other things which preclude our venturing out (c) However, there are also times when we must leave our houses and brave the world i) Even under the most adverse conditions b.

The mind & heart of YaHWeH are revealed. It appears that He is speaking to Himself &/or Noah but obviously & ultimately reveals His heart to Moses the writer. God's Spirit would not contend for control with any person for any great deal of time, as had been exemplified by the unusually(?) long lives in the genealogy of Adam(5:1-32). God has granted man much time to respond positively to God's love. *Probably*: This may also be interpreted as YaHoWeH's having reached the point of ultimate frustration with His offer of grace. God is giving man 120 years to repent prior to the arrival of judgment, i.e., prior to the Flood. *This scenario seems a better fit in the context of 'the times'(4:16--5:32), than to see it as a lowering of the physical age of men(in general) following the Flood.

Matthew 25:31-46,"('Love The Lord', 'Love Your Neighbor', 'I Never Knew You')",Baptist," Introduction A. Our passage this morning is the same as last week. The judgment of the sheep and the goats. 1. Last week I covered the first two points in this passage a. The Son of Man is coming to judge (v.31-33). b. The judgment of sheep (v.34-40). B. I pointed out that this is what is known as the judgement of the nations 1. And that nations are made up of people a. I pointed out the compassion that we as a nation demonstrate b. That we have a nation that is concerned about other people c. That we have a nation that gives to charities and disaster relief in record amounts d. That it is the individuals that give to the charities and disaster relief efforts e. I also pointed out that there has to be millions of Americans who give nothing (1) That if each of the 300 million Americans gave a single dollar to the Red Cross each year, it would never be short of funds. (2) So why does the Red Cross continually need more funds? (3) Because a lot of individuals in our country that never give a dime to charity f. The king in our passage is dealing with the people of the nations (1) And the goats, the cheap, penny-pinching, chintzy, petty and miserly individuals will be judged for their goaty ways C. The last two points in our passage are as follows 1. The judgment of goats (v.41-45). 2. This judgment is for eternity (v.46). a. For a quick review of our first two points, let us turn to Matthew 25:31 - 33 II. Body A. The Son of Man is coming to judge (v.31-33). Matthew 25:31-33 (NKJV) ""When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He will sit on the throne of His glory. {32} ""All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats. {33} ""And He will set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left. 1. Jesus says that the Son of Man comes in His glory to sit on the throne of His glory, that is the throne of David a. He is coming as the King of Kings to rule the earth with His rod of iron b. He will become the Judge of the whole universe, the Judge who is exalted above all 2. When He comes, He is coming to gather all nations. a. All men will be gathered by the angels and brought before Him. b. As I said, the word nations stresses that every single country, place, nationality, race, creed, color, language-every living citizen will be gathered before Him in judgment. 3. When He comes, He is coming to separate the individuals of the nations. a. There has always been a mixture of sheep and goats, of good and evil, of wheat and tares that have grown up together (1) In the same world (2) In the same employments (3) In the same nations (4) In the same churches (5) In the same cities (6) In the same families 4. Christ will separate the good from the bad, the sheep from the goats (1) The sheep will be placed on His right hand, the position of honor, glory, acceptance, and favor. (2) The goats will be place at His left hand, the place of dishonor, and rejection 5. Again, these are the individuals who are living when Christ returns to the earth the reign and rule"

Yesterday, All those backups seemed a waste of pay. Now my database has gone away. Oh I believe in yesterday. Suddenly, There's not half the files there used to be, And there's a milestone hanging over me. The system crashed so suddenly. I pushed something wrong. What it was I could not say. Now all my data's gone and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay. Yesterday, The need for back-ups seemed so far away. I knew my data was all here to stay, Now I believe in yesterday. 1. Lets begin by turning to Matthew 9:27 B. This chapter seems to be loaded with miracles 1. Remember the paralyzed man whose friends tore up a roof to let the man down before Jesus? a. In order that you might know that the Son of Man has the power to forgive sin, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, ""Take up your bed and walk."" b. And the man walked. 2. Of course then Jesus called Levi and gave him the name Matthew 3. Matthew gave a dinner party to which came sinners and tax collectors 4. Jesus answered the question about fasting a. ""Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? 5. Then there was the resurrection of Jairus' daughter 6. And the healing of the woman with the issue of blood 7. And now we see the healing of two blind men II. Body A. Persistence Matthew 9:27 NKJV When Jesus departed from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, ""Son of David, have mercy on us!"" 1. Apparently these two blind men had been sitting by the road side and heard what was going on a. It could be that they heard the commotion and asked one in the crowd what was going on b. Needless to say, they discovered the who, what, and how of the hubbub going on around them c. Something happened within both of them (1) A spark (2) A hope (3) A belief d. And they both got up and began to follow Jesus (1) The Scripture says, crying out and saying, ""Son of David, have mercy on us."" (a) Turn to Acts 1:15 and Acts 1:21-22 (2) Jesus usually had His disciples with Him (a) And not necessarily just the twelve Acts 1:15 NKJV And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said, Acts 1:21-22 NKJV ""Therefore, of these men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, {22} ""beginning from the baptism of John to that day when He was taken up from us, one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection."" (b) We know that there were many who walked with the Lord all during His ministry on earth (3) Further, it seems as though crowds of the curious were around Jesus often 2. Such crowds are noisy and so the blind men must have been shouting, ""Son of David, have mercy on us."" 3. Notice, too, that they did everything they could to get their needs met a. They followed Jesus b. They shouted, ""Son of David, have mercy on us."" c. They would not let anything distract them fro their purpose"
Matthew 9:32-34,"('Mute', 'Demon Possession', 'Demon-Possession')",Baptist," I. Introduction A. A Church note in The New Forest Magazine, England: ""In the future the preacher for next Sunday will be found hanging on the notice board."" B. Davy Troxel from New Albany, Ind wrote in the Christian Reader this little story: One day in junior church, I taught about Gideon. The following Sunday, for the sake of review, I asked who remembered last week's Bible hero. No hands went up. ""Okay,"" I said. ""I'll give you a clue: he fought a battle using only lamps, pitchers, and trumpets."" Still no response. ""Maybe you remember how he used a fleece to learn God's will,"" I said. Ten little blank faces stared at me. ""One final clue,"" I pleaded. ""There are people today with the same name as our hero, who go around hotels putting Bibles in the rooms."" Finally an eager 8-year-old boy shot up his hand and said, ""Oh! Oh! It was Hilton!"" C. Today we will examine one more miracle 1. In this chapter Jesus has done many miracles a. He has healed a paralytic (1) You know, the one lowered down through the roof b. He has healed Jairus' daughter (1) Well, resurrected Jairus' daughter c. He healed the woman with the issue of blood d. He gave sight to two blind men 2. And now, He will heal the mute by casting out the evil spirit a. Turn to Matthew 9:32 II. Body A. The demon possessed man was brought to Jesus by another or others Matthew 9:32 NKJV As they went out, behold, they brought to Him a man, mute and demon-possessed. 1. This man was possessed by an evil spirit a. Anthony of Egypt said, in part, ""Demons are very cowardly, always anxious about the fire that has been prepared for them."" (1) If we turn to Matthew 8:28-29 (2) The demon called legion when confronted by Jesus showed their fear Matthew 8:28-29 NKJV When He had come to the other side, to the country of the Gergesenes, there met Him two demon-possessed men, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass that way. {29} And suddenly they cried out, saying, ""What have we to do with You, Jesus, You Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?"" 2. The man with the mute spirit had to be brought to Jesus a. He would not have voluntarily gone to Jesus b. The demon would have wanted to keep the man away from the Lord B. There are lessons to be learned here 1. One, Many have to be brought to Jesus if they are ever to come. a. They are too weak in spirit, mind, or body to come on their own b. Remember the paralytic who's friends brought him to Jesus and would not be deterred from their purpose c. Remember, friends and family have the greatest chance of bringing some one to Christ (1) We tell the AWANA kids just to ask their friends to come (2) Its the easiest thing to do, won't you come to AWANA with me this Wednesday evening? 2. Two, We must go after the needy in order for them to come a. Many would come (1) If we would simply visit and go after them (2) If we would make friends and nurture them along the way 3. Three, Some are possessed by the wrong spirit a. Spiritually they are mute, lacking knowledge of the Lord"
Matthew 9:35-38,"('Make Disciples', 'Love Your Neighbor')",Baptist," Introduction A. My Dad and I were talking the other night about love and marriage. He told me that he knew as early as their wedding what marriage to my Mom would be like. It seems the minister asked my Mom, ""Do you take this man to be your husband."" And she said, ""I do."" Then the minister asked my Dad, ""Do you take this woman to be your wife,"" and my Mom said, ""He does."" A. Last week we saw that many people have to be brought to Jesus 1. There was the paralyzed man that was brought to Jesus by his four friends a. They refused to be deterred from their purpose and tore up the roof of the house to get their friend before Jesus b. There were several men who had to go to Jesus to see their loved ones healed 2. There were others who were driven to Jesus because of physical ailments a. The prime example was the woman who had the 12 year long issue of blood (1) Turn to 1 John 5:14-15 B. We also brought up the fact that we are hampered in any evangelistic efforts by 1. Our handicaps 2. Distance 3. The resistance of the others 4. We reminded that even though we are providentially hinder in our evangelistic efforts we can always pray 5. Even though we are unable to make that contact our prayers are heard by God 1 John 5:14-15 NKJV Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. {15} And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him. C. Today we continue more of less in this vain 1. Jesus mission was to bring to men the gospel a. The gospel being authenticated by (1) Miracles (2) Signs (3) And wonders b. But, even more Jesus brought the gospel authenticated by compassion and love (1) Lets turn to Matthew 9:35 - 36 II. Body A. The authentication of Jesus gospel Matthew 9:35-36 NKJV Then Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. {36} But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and scattered, like sheep having no shepherd. 1. Jesus-style love is the opposite of the world's power-based, accomplishment-equals-importance viewpoint. 2. Christian love means putting the other person first, seeking the other person's well being regardless of what it costs. a. As I was taught Christian love is doing the very best for the one we love regardless of the cost to us. 3. There are some lessons to be gleaned from this passage a. The first lesson is that Jesus method of spreading the gospel was to go to where the people who needed the gospel were (1) He went about all the cities and villages, teaching and preaching b. Grace Baptist is a member of The Conservative Baptist Association of America (1) We are also a member of the Rocky Mountain Conservative Baptist Association (a) But, it seems that the leadership of these associations cannot be inconvenienced to come to the villages (b) They will only meet in the cities"
Matthew 10:1-4,"(""Christ's Commands"", 'Call To Christ', 'Empowered By Christ')",Baptist," I. Introduction A. This is another of Pastor Tim's clean Jokes. The day I immigrated to the United States, I was given an alien ID card that featured a cute photo of me at age 15. Years later, when I went to the courthouse to become a citizen, a clerk confiscated my card. ""What will you do with it?"" my wife asked. ""We burn it"" was the answer. ""Could you please cut the photo off and let us keep it?"" asked my wife. ""Certainly not,"" said the clerk. ""This card is official U.S. government property. As such it cannot be mutilated before it's destroyed."" B. This passage applies to the call of the twelve Apostles who were sent to the lost sheep of Israel. 1. In many ways this passage does not apply to the church 2. However, there are lessons to be learned which can be gleaned from even this Scripture. C. In Matthew 4:18 - 22; Matthew 9:9, and John 1:35-51 Jesus called various disciples Matthew 4:18-22 (NKJV) And Jesus, walking by the Sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. {19} Then He said to them, ""Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men."" {20} They immediately left their nets and followed Him. {21} Going on from there, He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. He called them, {22} and immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him. 1. These four men, fishermen, became fishers of men, evangelists a. And so spread the net to catch men, to win souls to Christ b. As we are to be soul winners as well Matthew 9:9 (NKJV) As Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, ""Follow Me."" So he arose and followed Him. 2. This one man came to Christ and the first thing he did was invite his acquaintances to meet Jesus a. Phil Lutz worked for me in Hawaii. He had been saved one week end and the first thing he wanted to do was share his new faith with me b. And so ought we all (1) We do not have to allow our ardor to cool (2) Christ can and will rekindle the flame we once had if we ask John 1:34-43 (NKJV) And I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God."" {35} Again, the next day, John stood with two of his disciples. {36} And looking at Jesus as He walked, he said, ""Behold the Lamb of God!"" {37} The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. {38} Then Jesus turned, and seeing them following, said to them, ""What do you seek?"" They said to Him, ""Rabbi"" (which is to say, when translated, Teacher), ""where are You staying?"" {39} He said to them, ""Come and see."" They came and saw where He was staying, and remained with Him that day (now it was about the tenth hour). {40} One of the two who heard John speak, and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. {41} He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, ""We have found the Messiah"" (which is translated, the Christ). {42} And he brought him to Jesus. Now when Jesus looked at him, He said, ""You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas"" (which is translated, A Stone). {43} The following day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee, and He found Philip and said to him, ""Follow Me. {44} Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. {45} Philip found Nathaniel and said to him, ""We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."" {46} And Nathaniel said to him, ""Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"" Philip said to him, ""Come and see."" {47} Jesus saw Nathaniel coming toward Him, and said of him, ""Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!"" {48} Nathaniel said to Him, ""How do You know me?"" Jesus answered and said to him, ""Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.""{49} Nathaniel answered and said to Him, ""Rabbi, You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!"" {50} Jesus answered and said to him, ""Because I said to you, 'I saw you under the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things than these."" {51} And He said to him, ""Most assuredly, I say to you, hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man."""
Hebrews 11:1-3,"('Faith', 'Critical', 'Investigation')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," C.F.I. Critical Faith Investigation Hebrews 11:1-3 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report. Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. Hebrews 11:1-3 As we look at the breakdown of the message it is clear that we must understand the importance of examining where we stand in our Faith. Let me give an expository breakdown of the word Faith. When we were little children and our parents asked us every year about two to three months before the holidays or our birthdays what we wanted. And we eagerly prepared the list of desires we had within our little minds yet every year they managed to produce the list and we as children looked up to them even more in our belief that they could do the impossible. If we think about this level of Faith that we had as children and look into the word of God in Mark 9:37 Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me but him that sent me. Think about this point as we all have aged overtime we waiver in our Faith with doubt, fears, and questions not having that Faith like we did as the innocents of children. Therefore in this message there are 2 key points we have to address 1. How powerful is your Faith 2. Are you running and Shining in your Faith 3. The ABC's of Faith See when I researched just the word FAITH I found that HOPE is an important factor in this message for Hope is the key factor to how effective we are in our walk in Faith. Let me give it to this way Just as Grace and Mercy, Love and Patience walk together HOPE and FAITH walk the same way. Therefore in the book of Hebrews itself is a combination of Letters giving a direct understanding of the portrayal of Jesus Christ as our Intercessor at the Throne. It is clear that we as Christians deserve better in every way. We must recognize that the Book Hebrews has been considered the fifth Gospel for it describes Christ's ministry in heaven at the right hand of God the father. Therefore think about it when you hear these two words Critical and Investigation the first thing that generally comes to mind is there is a something drastically wrong such as a medical test that you await the lab technicians to test. Or there is criminal matter that is a strong concern for the communities and the police are doing a deep investigation. But when we think of being critical regarding our individual FAITH are we true to ourselves in our mirror examination of how effective is our FAITH. Turn to your neighbor and say neighbor; you can wake up now the preacher is done with just the introduction. During the time of World War II there was a prisoner in Auschwitz concentration camp by the name of Dr. Viktor Frankl and Austrian psychiatrist who during his years of captivity observed how some people survived the divesting camps they were placed in and others did not.

(GWT) Blessed is the person whose disobedience is forgiven and whose sin is pardoned. 2 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile. (GWT) Blessed is the person whom the LORD no longer accuses of sin and who has no deceitful thoughts. 3 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long. (GWT) When I kept silent {about my sins}, my bones began to weaken because of my groaning all day long. 4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah. (GWT) Day and night your hand lay heavily on me. My strength shriveled in the summer heat. Selah 5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah. (GWT) I made my sins known to you, and I did not cover up my guilt. I decided to confess them to you, O LORD. Then you forgave all my sins. Selah 6 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him. (GWT) For this reason let all godly people pray to you when you may be found. Then raging floodwater will not reach them. 7 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah. (GWT) You are my hiding place. You protect me from trouble. You surround me with joyous songs of salvation. Selah 8 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. (GWT) {The LORD says,} ""I will instruct you. I will teach you the way that you should go. I will advise you as my eyes watch over you. 9 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee. (GWT) Don't be stubborn like a horse or mule. {They need} a bit and bridle in their mouth to restrain them, or they will not come near you."" 10 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.

Each ant can sting multiple times! Their Venom contains an alkaloid(high pH) enzyme of piperidine--Solenopsin A. It kills the skin cells & causes the burning sensation. It also contains a minimal amount of proteins(.01%-- allergens, phospholipase, hyaluronidase, & neurotoxins), which in certain people, can cause a deadly allergic reaction(anaphylaxis). By their Distinctive Walk, fire ants command respect. Christians all have a life-""walk"" that distinguishes them from the walk of the world. And their Distinctive Walk commands respect for God & all that is God's. Paul exhorted the Ephesian church toward a telling/distinctive/indicative walk. God's people have a(n) telling/distinctive/indicative walk. What is telling/distinctive/indicative about the walk of God's people? *When is the walk of God's people indicative? 7 indicators of a Christian walk. We have seen that A thankful/telling walk is... 1. An ACCURATE WALK(:15) 2. A REDEMPTIVE WALK(:16) 3. An INSIGHTFUL WALK(:17) 4. An UNCOMPROMISING WALK(:18) 5--A thankful/telling walk is... A SHARING WALK(:19) Explanation:(:19) :19--""speaking to one another in psalms & hymns & spiritual songs, singing & making melody in your heart to the Lord,"" When I am filled with the Spirit of God(:18) in public worship or in relation to my Christian brothers & sisters, I do not sing or babble incoherently. I am not to indulge myself inwardly & outwardly. I am rather to surrender all my being to God so that my speech comes to myself & others in the form of singing. ""Singing"" cannot occur either inwardly or outwardly until my inward ""heart"" is made ""melodious."" Only ""the Lord"" can make your ""heart"" be given to such joy that it must be shared or 'spoken.' ""Many who can't sing well have the most beautiful melodies in their heart.""--David Guzik There are various manifestations of joyful Holy Spirit filling, which revolve around the sharing of our individual joy in the Spirit, with the other members of our Christian family. By the Holy Spirit our attitudes become His, & sharing that overcoming attitude is vital to all exposed...particularly among our Christian family. The believer's song-speaking incorporates every area of music adopted & appropriate to such communication/employment. All singing in the Lord must flow from a ""melody"" within the ""heart"" of the believer. That ""melody"" which moves us is directed God-ward. It is not so much the music but the message that is important. The music is a variable hook upon which the message hangs. ""Psalms""-singing--Speaks God's written & living word into & for others. ""Hymns""-singing--Speaks in praise of all that is good in God. It is a term which was used in secular Greek to ascribe praise to their gods, heroes, & conquerers."
"Genesis 15:6, Romans 4:13","('Faith', 'Righteousness', 'Law And Grace')",Church Of God," An Expose' on Righteousness - Part I (Righteous by Faith) Lakewood / Speaker: Jonathan L. Vorce / 8-30- 2012 Genesis 15:6; Romans 4:13 Introduction: 1. In Genesis Chapter 14 Abram had been offered material things by the king of Sodom after a successful recovery of the people and goods that had been taken in a raid by their enemies. a. Abram was not interested in the material things that the king of Sodom was offering. b. In verse 23 he told the king of Sodom that he would not take anything from a thread to a shoe latchet unless he would tell people he had made Abram rich. 2. Abram also paid tithes to Melchizedek (the king of Salem and priest of the Most High God) in Genesis 14:18-20 a. This set Abram up to receive the ""bountiful blessings of God"" that we see promised in the beginning of chapter 15. b. Tithing has a way of opening up heaven to us. Abram began to have revelations from God and received the promises of God for himself and future generations. Introduction Ended: I. Genesis 15:1-6 At least four times in scripture that we know of, the Bible says that ""Abraham believed God and it was counted (or imputed) unto him for righteousness"". (Genesis 15:6, Romans 4:3, Galatians 3:6, and James 2:23) A. Righteousness - dikaiosune (greek) is ""the character or quality of being right or just"" 1. It was formerly spelled ""rightwiseness,"" which clearly expresses the meaning 2. It is used to denote an attribute of God, e.g., Romans 3:5, the context of which shows that ""the righteousness of God"" means essentially the same as His faithfulness, or truthfulness, that which is consistent with His own nature and promises! II. Begin an expository expose' of Romans Chapter 3. A. Paul was defending the gospel of the Grace of God which comes through the Cross of Jesus Christ and makes us righteous by faith. 1. Romans 3:25 - 26 speaks of His ""righteousness"" as exhibited in the death of Christ, which is sufficient to show men that God is neither indifferent to sin nor regards it lightly. B. He is having an open discussion with a conscious objector of grace for the Gentiles. 1. In the first eight verses of this chapter Paul continues explaining the guilt of the Jews and laying the foundation for the necessity of a redeemer. 2. He dialogues with an individual in open discussion concerning the guilt that the law brings. C. He explored the condemnation of the law and explained that only God can make us ""righteous by faith"". 1. Verses 9-22 D. He rounds it out in verses 22 - 31 by saying: 1. Verse 28 - ""Man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law..."" 2. Verse 31 - That this teaching does not make the law void, it actually establishes it! Conclusion - Righteousness demonstrates that quality of holiness in Him (God) which must find expression in His condemnation of sin. God is a righteous God (faithful, true and holy) and He will not let sin slide but He has provided a way, through the sacrifice of His Son Jesus, to right the wrongs in your life and bring you back into fellowship with God. Righteousness by Faith..."
1 Corinthians 10:13-14,"('Happiness', 'Temptation')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Tame Your Temptation Habits of Happiness Part 2 1 Corinthians 10:13-14 We all want to be happy. I bet there is no single person who intentionally chooses to be unhappy. However, so many people in this world are not happy for one reason or another. In order to be happy, this is what we have to realize. Happiness is our choice. Happiness is something that we choose. In order to be happy, we must do things that will bring happiness. However, there are many who are not happy. It is partly because of the way they think, the way they talk, and the way they act does not make them happy. When people think negatively, talk critically, and act unbiblically, these are not something that they acquired overnight. They are habits that they have built. Therefore, in order to be happy, we must change the way we think, talk, and act. We must build habits of thinking, talking, and acting biblically. And we can form these habits by repeatedly doing them. Therefore, during this series, we are talking about habits that we must build to experience happiness in our lives. And today we will talk about the importance of taming our temptation. When we give into temptation, we will suffer. We will suffer from guilt, embarrassment, and shame. This is why in order to be happy, we must to tame our temptation. We shouldn't be surprised when temptation knocks at our doors. We are Satan's most strategic targets. He tempts Christians who seek to live godly lives. The early Christians in the Bible also struggled with temptations just as we do. We find one of the examples in the church in Corinth. Corinth was one of the most wicked cities in the first-century world. And the church in Corinth was composed of people, who were products of that culture. They had difficulty giving up the habits of their culture. It is easy for me to imagine that one day Paul received a letter from some young man in Corinth. The letter must have said something like this. ""Sir, I gave my heart to Jesus. I made the commitment to follow Jesus. Then why is it that I still want to do all the old things? My mind and my appetites are the same as they ever were. Honestly, I am disappointed. I thought Jesus would make me strong."" Perhaps there was a young man like that, and perhaps Paul had him in mind when he wrote this section of his letter dealing with new life and old appetites. I believe that Paul's words for him can be applied to you and me, who are trying to tame our temptations. Paul gave us this advice to help tame our temptation. I. We must remember that we are not alone (v. 13a). Verse 13a says this. No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. These are words of reassurance. Whatever we are going through, we must remember that we are not the only ones to have passed that way. We are in good company. This is something that we tend to forget in the midst of temptation. We feel isolated. We feel that we are the only ones who are struggling with this temptation. The devil has a way of slipping the blinders onto our heads, so that we can see no one else.

"Romans 4:1, Genesis 15:6","('Faith', 'Justification', 'Righteousness', 'Grace & Faith')",Church Of God," An Expose on Righteousness - Part II Lakewood / Speaker: Pastor Jonathan / 9-6- 2012 Text: Romans Chapter 4 OBJECTIVES IN STUDYING THIS CHAPTER 1. To understand how Abraham was justified in God's sight 2. To see that the ""righteousness"" God imputes to man involves justification (i.e.,forgiveness) 3. To comprehend the nature of justifying faith by considering the example of Abraham I. Let's summarize our study for tonight and see if we have time to dig in deeper. A. Now that he has declared that God's righteousness is to be found in a system involving justification by faith and not by keeping the works of any law, Paul proceeds to provide evidence by referring to Abraham's example. 1. In considering the justification of Abraham, Paul quotes Genesis 15:6 where it is stated that Abraham's faith was accounted to him for righteousness (1-3). 2. Abraham trusted in God, not in his own works, and through such faith experienced the righteousness (forgiveness) expressed by David in Psalms 31:1,2 (4-8). B. To demonstrate further that God's righteousness by faith is offered to both Jew and Gentile, Paul again appeals to the example of Abraham. 1. He reminds them that Abraham's faith was accounted for righteousness prior to receiving circumcision, which was in itself a seal of the righteousness of the faith he had while uncircumcised. a. Thus Abraham serves as a father of all who believe, whether circumcised or not (9-12). C. Paul then reminds them that the promise that Abraham was to be ""a father of many nations"" was given in light of his faith, not through some law, so that the promise might be according to grace and sure to those who have the same kind of faith as Abraham (13-17). D. Finally, the nature of Abraham's obedient faith is illustrated (18-22), with the explanation it was preserved to reassure us that we who have the same kind faith in God who raised Jesus will find our faith accounted for righteousness in the same way (23-25). OUTLINE - Digging Deeper II. JUSTIFICATION OF ABRAHAM AS AN EXAMPLE (1-8) A. HOW ABRAHAM WAS JUSTIFIED (1-5) 1. If by works, then he could boast (1-2) 2. The Scriptures reveal it was by his faith in God (3) a. One who trusts in works, seeks God's debt, not His grace (4) b. But when one trusts in God to justify him, such faith is counted for righteousness (5) B. THE TESTIMONY OF DAVID (6-8) 1. Even David spoke of God imputing righteousness apart from works (6) 2. Blessed are those against whom God does not impute sins (7-8) III. RIGHTEOUSNESS BY FAITH AVAILABLE TO ALL BELIEVERS (9-25) A. BECAUSE ABRAHAM WAS JUSTIFIED BEFORE CIRCUMCISION (9-12) 1. His faith was counted for righteousness before he was circumcised (9-10) 2. Circumcision was a seal of the righteousness he had while uncircumcised (11a) 3. Thus he became the father of all who have the same kind of faith, both circumcised and uncircumcised (11b-12) B. BECAUSE THE PROMISE TO ABRAHAM WAS GRANTED THROUGH FAITH (13-25) 1. The promise to be the heir of the world given in view of his faith (13) 2. It was not given through law (14-15)"
Ephesians 6:1-4,"('Parenting', 'Godly Parents', 'Father And Son', 'Raising Children')",Assembly Of God," Complete series on Prioritize your life at http://www.cityharvestagchurch.org/category/sermons-and-sermon-series/prioritize-your-life Illustration: The story of two paddleboats. They left Memphis about the same time, traveling down the Mississippi River to New Orleans. As they traveled side by side, sailors from one vessel made a few remarks about the snail's pace of the other. Words were exchanged. Challenges were made. And the race began. Competition became vicious as the two boats roared through the Deep South. One boat began falling behind. Not enough fuel. There had been plenty of coal for the trip, but not enough for a race. As the boat dropped back, an enterprising young sailor took some of the ship's cargo and tossed it into the ovens. When the sailors saw that the supplies burned as well as the coal, they fueled their boat with the material they had been assigned to transport. They ended up winning the race, but burned their cargo. God has entrusted cargo to us, too: children, spouses, friends. Our job is to do our part in seeing that this cargo reaches its destination. Yet when the program takes priority over people, people often suffer. How much cargo do we sacrifice in order to achieve the number one slot? How many people never reach the destination because of the aggressiveness of a competitive captain? Most people are living a compromised life just because they have misplaced matters of great importance in life. Instead of concentrating on things that are really vital and what takes them forward, they are messed up in the petty things of life that pull them down. We have been studying on the subject of priority for a believer and we began by looking at the top three priorities of a believer. Last week we covered the area of spiritual life. Today I would speak on the next priority of a believer. Prioritize your family, starting with parenting; roles of the parents and children within a family. Prioritize your family. God's second priority for us is our relationship within the family. Proverbs 14:26 Whoever fears the Lord has a secure fortress, and for their children it will be a refuge. The Bible portrays the family as a fortress. The only way Christian families can be safe in the fortress of family is when the family members live in the fear of the Lord. A fortress has a boundary and it is the responsibility of the people living inside of it to safeguard its boundary. To guard the borders of our country, it takes the gatekeepers, the soldiers, the army, navy, intelligence all to work together to keep intruders out. As a family you are building a wall, you are protecting your marriage, your kids, and all what God has given you. Remember Satan is an intruder waiting to attack Christian families and it takes the husband, wife, and children to work together in the fear of the Lord to safeguard your family. So everyone has a responsibility and a role in the family. Only when we fulfill our God given roles in the family can our family be safe and protected."
Matthew 19:5-6,"('Husband And Wife', 'Husband Duties', 'Wife Duties')",Assembly Of God," Complete series on prioritizing your life at http://www.cityharvestagchurch.org/category/sermons-and-sermon-series/prioritize-your-life Joke: Attending a wedding for the first time, a little girl whispered to her mother, ""Why is the bride wearing white?"" Her mother said, ""Because white is the color of happiness, and today is the happiest day of her life!"" The little girl thought about this for a minute, then asked, ""Why is the groom wearing black?"" Introduction: We have been studying on the subject of priority of a believer and we began by looking at the top three priorities of a believer. First spiritual life. Last week we spoke about the priority of family and we covered the roles of parents and children. Today I would speak on couples. 1. Consider your relationship as primary. Since this is a primary relationship, you need to spend the maximum time for this relationship. Joke: A husband and wife were at a party chatting with some friends when the subject of marriage counseling came up. ""Oh, we never need that. My wife and I have a great relationship,"" the husband explained. ""We work in a university. She lectures on communications in college and I lecture in theatre arts."" He continued, ""She communicates well, and I act like I'm listening."" Nowadays, almost all couples are very busy with work, responsibilities and raising kids. Couples either get so involved in their job, responsibilities at home, kids' lives (Their tuitions, hobbies, sports, dance, and music lessons) or they become interested in their own activities or hobbies that they don't spend time with each other. They forget to nurture their relationship with each other. As the years go by they get farther and farther apart, until they can't even remember what it feels like to be in love with each other, to hold each other's hands. Illustration: Married couples spend an average of 27.5 minutes per week talking to each other, according to Ray Bridwhistell, speech communication expert. However, they spend 46 hours per week watching TV. Do you know why so many parents struggle with empty nest syndrome? The kids move out of the house, and they get depressed because their lives revolved solely around their kids, they look at each other and wonder who are you, and now what are we going to do? The problem is many are married but their primary relationship is not either one of them. Do you know that some the couples live like roommates in the same house? Joke: A husband read an article to his wife about how women use 30,000 words a day to a man's 15,000. The wife replied, ""That's because we have to repeat everything to men."" The husband turned to his wife and said, ""What?"" It is possible to climb the pinnacle of success in our career only to realize that we are leaning on the wrong wall. The wrong wall is our ignoring our relationship with our spouse. You do everything else but fall out on the relationship with your spouse. Marriage is the most important relationship which we tend to overlook. God sees marriage as a first and most foundational relationship, second only to our relationship with God. Marriage is more important than our relationship with our parents, children, or siblings."
Philippians 3:13-14,"('Christian Maturity', 'One Thing Needful', 'Run Toward The Prize')",Assembly Of God," Complete list of New Year sermons at http://www.cityharvestagchurch.org/category/sermons-and-sermon-series/new-year-sermons/ Philippians 3:13-14 13But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, 14I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus. The theme here is reaching for the prize. I think Apostle Paul must have loved athletics and he uses it in his writings. The analogy is that of a runner who is running to win in order that he might gain the prize. Paul is talking about Christian effort toward growth. Many believers live stagnant spiritual life because all their focus every year is worldly gain, wealth and prosperity and then people think once they come to Christ, saved and baptized, all their work is over. Earlier in this chapter, Paul gives his credentials in before coming to Christ. Philippians 3:5-6 5Circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee; 6as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for righteousness based on the law, faultless. He was a God-fearing, law-abiding Jew. So he assumed that all of these things made him right with God. Then on the Damascus Road he was confronted with the living Christ. And he saw that all of those works and achievements hindered him from being right with God. Then he abandoned everything and received Christ. Philippians 3:7 But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. In verses 8 through 11 then he began to recite what he gained in Christ when he was saved. I. What do we gain when we receive Christ. 1. The knowledge of Christ. Philippians 3:8 What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. 2. The righteousness of Christ. Philippians 3:9 Not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ--the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith. 3. The power of Christ. Philippians 3:10 I want to know Christ--yes, to know the power of his resurrection... 4. The fellowship of Christ. Philippians 3:10 I want to know Christ--yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death. 5. The glory of Christ. Philippians 3:11 ...and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead. Now, when Paul says he gained all these things in Christ, we may assume that Paul had reached spiritual perfection being just saved. So, to answer anybody who feels that because we are in Christ therefore we are perfect, Paul quickly launches into a passage which is a total disclaimer of any spiritual perfection. Philippians 3:12 Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. He is not reached perfection. He is still temptable. He still has the flesh."
Philippians 3:13-14,"('Run To Win', 'Run Toward The Prize')",Assembly Of God," Complete list of New Year sermons at http://www.cityharvestagchurch.org/category/sermons-and-sermon-series/new-year-sermons/ A blessed New year to you. It is such a joy to have you back again this evening. God gave us a wonderful start to the new year and believe this year we are all going to go to the next level in our walk with the Lord. A lot of people have died climbing the Alps, falling off of precipices. At the foot of one of the many mountains that has been attempted a number of times is a little grave, it's the grave of a man who tried to climb to the pinnacle and fell off a precipice to his death. The tombstone there is very simple. It gives his name and then it says, ""He died climbing."" That really should be the epitaph of the tomb of every Christian, ""He died running."" Reaching for the prize was the subject I was speaking to you at the Watch Night Service. We saw that as believers God has done has part in sending Jesus to die for us on the cross and now we have a great part in pursuing the prize that God has for us. We are how we can reach the prize. 4. Spiritual Motivation. Philippians 3:14 I press on toward the goal to win the prize. So there is a goal and there is a prize. For an athlete goal is to come to the finish line, once you finish first you are given a prize. In a Christian race everyone who finishes is given a prize. So what is the goal? To be like Jesus. Then what is the prize? To be made like Jesus. Philippians 3:12 I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus. When am I going to become like Jesus? When that heavenward call happens? When rapture happens I will be like Jesus. The goal is to strive to be like Christ. I put all my effort and with maximum concentration run my race. The prize is as I continue to do so I will be one day made like him in the rapture. So what motivates me? The heavenward call. We have to live in the light of being called out of this world in to presence of God and at that particular point we will be given an eternal reward, we will be made like Christ. And if God is so gracious to be willing to give us that prize, how committed should we be to run the race? Wretched. I don't know about you but that motivates me to run toward the goal. Paul saw it at the end of his life when he wrote his last letter and he said: 2 Timothy 4:7-8 7I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. 8Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day--and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing. What is the crown of righteousness? It's the crown which is righteousness. What is righteousness? Jesus Christ. So, reaching for the prize means realizing your need, means making a maximum effort, it means focused concentration and it means being motivated by the greatness of the prize itself. 5. Recognize divine resources."
Luke 7:1-17,"('Intercession', 'Faith Alive')",Lutheran," FIFTH SUNDAY AFTER THE EPIPHANY FEBRUARY 5, 2017 Luke 7:1-17 ""Lessons on Faith"" INTRODUCTION We learn in different ways. Some of us learn by reading, others by hearing and still others by hands on experience. There have been countless books written on the topic of faith. These have been helpful for many. For many other followers of Jesus, though, something more is needed. We have that ""more"" in today's text. The text contains great examples of what comprises an incomparable faith. FAITH: FOCUSED ON OTHERS It is common knowledge that faith is more than agreement in certain religious doctrines. Faith is not a noun, but rather it is a verb. In other words we do not ""have"" the faith, instead we ""live"" the faith. In the story of the Centurion and the healing of his servant we see the demonstration of a faith focused on others. The Centurion was not approaching Jesus on his own behalf, but rather the Centurion ""highly valued"" slave. Most of the time people approach Jesus to heal themselves. There are some notable exceptions, though. In the second chapter of Mark the author records that Jesus heals a paralytic. The man had been carried to Jesus by four of his friends. In the seventh chapter of Mark the author writes about a foreign woman who boldly approached Jesus on behalf of her daughter. It is not wrong for us to bring our needs before the Lord. God invites us to do this. We are also encouraged, though, to pray for the needs of others. One of the ways that we can bear one another's burdens is through prayer. At Desert Streams members are sent a monthly Prayer Calendar so that we can pray for each other and by doing so encourage each other in our lives of faith and service. We also have our Prayer Connections Team to pray for critical needs. There are times when, in the middle of our struggles or sicknesses we, ourselves, can't pray and we need to prayers of others. FAITH: HUMBLE The Centurion displays a notable sense of humility when he approaches Jesus. He doesn't feel worthy to approach Jesus and ask Jesus to heal his servant. So, the Centurion requests that Jewish officials speak to Jesus and make the request. When Jesus comes near the Centurion's home, the Centurion tells Jesus that he is not worthy to have Jesus enter his home. (It would have meant that Jesus would have been defiled according to Jewish law.) Instead the Centurion encourages Jesus to just say the word. We often attempt to approach Jesus from a position of strength. We remind Jesus why we are worthy of God answering our prayers. If we feel that our position is a little weak, we may resort to bargaining with God, saying that we will do something if God answers our prayers. When we read the story of the Centurion's servant, we understand that Jesus did not respond to the Centurion's request because the Centurion was worthy of answered prayer. We also assume that Jesus did not come to the Centurion's house because of who the Centurion was and how he could have forced Jesus do come if he wanted to do so. No, we realize that Jesus responded to the Centurion because Jesus saw a person in need--the slave."
Revelation 15:1-8,"(""God's Wrath"", 'Wrath Of God', 'Sea Of Glass', 'Seven Angels')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 1/15/17 Title: Prelude to Pouring Out the Seven Bowls of Wrath (15:1-8) Series: Verse By Verse Through Revelation Revelation 15:1-8 (KJV) 1 And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God. 2 And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God. 3 And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints. 4 Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest. 5 And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened: 6 And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles. 7 And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. 8 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled. Introduction We have already seen the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven personalities. Now the upcoming seven bowls of wrath are the worst of all. Chapter 15, besides being the shortest chapter in Revelation, is the preface to the final series of judgments which come on the earth during the Great Tribulation. These judgments are the most intense and devastating of any that have preceded them. ? This is the third time in Revelation that John introduces a sign. The first was the image of a woman that represented Israel (12:1). The second immediately followed; Satan in the form of a red dragon (12:3). This third sign is the angels of destruction with seven final plagues (15:1). Seven angels were given seven bowls from which they would pour out the seven ""bowl judgments,"" the wrath of God, the last plagues to be visited upon the earth. They will be used to destroy Satan, bring the final and complete punishment upon wickedness, and bring about the end of the Antichrist's reign--it will settle the issue of sin once and for all. Some believe that all of this will occur at the end of the seven-year period of tribulation, with the seven bowls following in rapid succession after the seal and trumpet judgments. Others who see the book of Revelation as presenting a series of cyclical events say that this is the most severe of the seven judgments, also heralding the end. The purpose of the Great Tribulation is judgment. It is not for the purifying of the church! God is going to remove the church before this time of tribulation because of His marvelous, infinite grace. If you are willing to accept His grace, then you can escape the Great Tribulation. Believe me, the bowls of wrath are not the ""blessed hope"" for which believers are looking. No, we are ""Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ"" (Titus 2:13). My friend, if you are trusting Christ, you won't be going through this terrible time. But you need to know what the unsaved will have to go through, and that might make you a zealous witness for Christ in these difficult days."
"1 Timothy 2:1-6, 1 Peter 2:5","('Prayer', 'Intercession', 'Intercessory Prayer')",Church Of God," Intercessory Prayer Lakewood / Speaker: Pastor Jonathan / 9-7-2014 I. Timothy 2:1-6 Introduction "" John G. Lake said, ""When you hear the children travail, know Jesus has one foot in the door."" "" Doug Small reminds us that, ""We are not a Church with a Prayer Ministry... We are a Praying Church"" I. What is Intercession? ""Intercession may be defined as holy, believing, persevering prayer whereby someone pleads with God on behalf of another or others who desperately need God's intervention."" (Full Life Bible) A. An intercessor is one who takes the place of another or pleads another's case. When you pray this way, you are interceding: B. THE BIBLICAL BASIS OF INTERCESSION 1. The Biblical basis for the New Testament believer's ministry of intercessory prayer is our calling as priests unto God. a. The Word of God declares that we are a holy priesthood (I Peter 2:5), b. A royal priesthood (I Peter 2:9), and c. A kingdom of priests (Revelation 1:5). II. Jesus was/is THE MODEL INTERCESSOR A. God's Word declares that God's purpose in sending Jesus was for Him to serve as an intercessor: And He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore His arm brought salvation unto Him, and His righteousness, it sustained Him. (Isaiah 59:16) B. Jesus stands before God and between Him and sinful man, just as the Old Testament priests did: For there is one God, and one mediator (intercessor) between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. (I Timothy 2:5) ...It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. (Romans 8:34) Wherefore He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them. (Hebrews 7:25) III. HOW TO INTERCEDE A. As intercessors following the Old Testament priestly function and the New Testament pattern of Jesus, we stand before God and between a righteous God and sinful man. 1. In order to be effective standing ""between"" we must first stand ""before"" God to develop the intimacy necessary to fulfill this role. B. The Bible uses two words to describe this priestly ministry: ""Holy"" and ""Royal."" 1 Peter 2:9 - But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: 1. Holiness (holy living) is required to stand before the Lord. a. We are able to do it only on the basis of the righteousness of Christ not our own righteousness. b. It's possible because of Calvary 2. Royalty is descriptive of kingly authority. a. Members of the ""royal family"" have legitimate access to the throne room (of God). Hebrews 4:16 - Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. C. Sometimes this priestly intercession is done with understanding. This occurs when you intercede for others in your own native language and you understand what you are saying:"
Matthew 6:5-15,"('Prayer', 'Prayer In The Spirit', 'Jesus The Mediator')",Nazarene," Please open your Bibles to Matthew 6:5-15 so you can follow along. What is prayer? Communication with God Worship Thanksgiving Requests Spiritual understanding Needs Worship (again) (Congregational reading of the Lord's Prayer on PPT from the KJV) So, let's go ahead and read Matthew 6:5-15 We pray a lot in our services: opening prayer, blessing the offering to the work of the Lord, pastoral prayer, sometimes prayer when starting the sermon and a prayer at the end of the service. Why do we pray so much in our worship services? The Lord is an active participant in the worship service. Who can pray? Everyone can pray Who do we pray to? We pray to the Father We pray to the Father through Jesus the One and Only Mediator We pray at the urging of the Holy Spirit How do we pray? Ephesians 6:18 ""And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord's people."" 1 Thessalonians 5:17 ""Pray continually"" Why do (or why should) we pray so much in our daily lives? The Lord is (or should be) an active participant in our daily lives. When do we usually ""resort"" to continual prayer? During times of crisis. During times of crisis we feel we ""need"" Jesus. When do we actually need Jesus? All the time! ""Pray continually"" does NOT mean repeating prayers over and over and over. Matthew 6:7 ""And when you pray, do not use vain repetitions as the heathen do. For they think that they will be heard for their many words."" We love to say the Lord's Prayer and it is a beautiful prayer but it is really an example, a kind of pattern Jesus gave to His disciples in order to teach them to pray. He never told them to repeat it over and over. The Lord wants us to talk to Him. He's not impressed with how many memorized prayers we can recite and how many times we can recite them. Prayer is an interactive activity involving us and the entire Trinity. We learn of God and His desires for us through His Holy Word. The Holy Spirit calls us to prayer. We bring our prayers to the Father through Jesus and in the authority of His name The Lord answers according to what is best for us The Lord moves in our spirits Examples: How the Lord moved our hearts in our calls to churches How the Lord moved my heart to change the sermon this morning. John 14:14 ""You may ask Me (Jesus) for anything in My name, and I will do it."" Who may ask Jesus for anything in His name and He will do it? Sons and daughters of God who are in right relationship with God. Sons and daughters of God who know the mind and the will of Christ. Sons and daughters of God who seek to do the will of Christ. Warning ... 1 Peter 3:12 ""For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and His ears are attentive to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."" Ex.

John 3:16-17,"('Code', 'Gospel', 'Ears To Hear', 'Codebreaker')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," CODEBREAKER I found it fascinating when I discovered he was a Codebreaker in the war. He looked somehow smaller now and curled up. I prayed for him, sang to him as light filtered through the window onto his old wrinkled brow. The movie ""The Imitation Game"" talked about Codebreaking in the war and the once relatively unknown place called Bletchley Park located in northern England became famous. Who knew that one of the magnificent old houses in Brisbane's sophisticated inner northern suburb of Ascot, 21 Henry St, housed the top-secret organization called the Central Bureau of Intelligence, Australia's equivalent to Britain's Bletchley Park. But of course, now we also know of the contribution of Australians like Jim (not his real name) which shortened the length of the war. Within those walls, the great unsung heroes of that war made their unique contribution to victory. It would be over 30 years before Jim spoke about it and only then was he able to receive his medals. The bible is difficult to interpret at times. it's a codebook, which if used well, can help us decipher the enigmas of life, fight the right battles, know the real enemy and bring us peace with God. CODEWORD - ""WATER"" In John 4:13-14 (NLT) Jesus is speaking to a woman at a well and He says, ""Anyone who drinks this water will soon become thirsty again. But those who drink the WATER I GIVE will never be thirsty again. It becomes a fresh, bubbling spring within them, giving them ETERNAL LIFE."" He speaks of the Water Of Life. What does He mean? Well, the woman, like Jim, was a codebreaker. She deciphered the code easily. She knew he was speaking about Heaven. The bible says heaven is a gift. You can't earn it or work for it or deserve it. It's as free as water from a well and it quenches our thirst for spiritual answers. Jim deciphered that message also when he expressed his belief in Christ. He is now spending his first 10,000 years in eternity with God, Revelation 21:4 (NLT) says God will ""...wipe every tear from his eyes, and there will be no more death or sorrow or crying or pain. All these things are gone forever."" The only thing that stands in the way of all of us having that gift relates to the second Bible... CODEWORD - ""DARKNESS"" The Japanese used difficult ciphers and complex codes which required intense and concentrated intellectual efforts to break. The Codebreakers were often left in the dark. In code-breaking and life, we all go through times of darkness. Isaiah 59:1-21 (NLT) says ""... We look for light but find only darkness. We look for bright skies but walk in gloom. We grope like the blind along a wall, feeling our way like people without eyes. Even at brightest noontime, we stumble as though it were dark."" War itself is a time of darkness, and so is grief, but it's fairly easy to decode the darkness the Bible refers to here as meaning our sin. The Bible says we cannot save ourselves from our sin. We all need God's forgiveness. Jim found that forgiveness. How did that happen?"
Galatians 5:16-26,"('Flesh', 'Sin Nature', 'Fruit Of Holy Spirit')",Evangelical Free," Jo Guerrero's five-year-old daughter, Barbara, had disobeyed her mother and had been sent to her room. After a few minutes, Jo (the mom) went in to talk with her about what she had done. Teary-eyed, the little girl asked, ""Why do we do wrong things, Mommy?"" Jo replied, ""Sometimes the devil tells us to do something wrong, and we listen to him. We need to listen to God instead."" To which she sobbed, ""But God doesn't talk loud enough!"" (Jo M. Guerrero, Christian Reader, Sep/Oct 1996) Can you relate? Sometimes you feel like the compulsion to sin is louder and stronger than God's gentle prodding to do what's right. There is a real battle raging within our own hearts, and more often than we care to admit, the wrong side wins. The question is: How do you win the battle against our compulsion to sin? How do you conquer this sinful nature that resides in each one of us? How do you overcome the perversions of your own flesh? Well, if you have your Bibles, I invite you to turn with me to Galatians 5, Galatians 5, where the Bible gives us a surprising answer. Galatians 5:16 But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. (ESV) Literally, ""Walk by means of the Spirit"" - i.e., step-by-step, moment-by-moment, depend on the Spirit of God. For if you do, ""you will BY NO MEANS and IN NO WAY gratify the desires of the flesh"" - It's a double negative in the Greek. The Spirit and the flesh are absolutely incompatible! Here's the surprise. You overcome our desire to sin NOT through your own will-power and self-effort. No. You overcome your desire to sin only through a moment-by-moment dependence upon the Spirit of God. You cannot live by our own human spirit. Instead, you must... LIVE BY THE HOLY SPIRIT. You must depend on the Holy Spirit's power. You must rely on the Spirit of God, and then (and only then) will you conquer the desires of the flesh. Galatians 5:17 For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. (ESV) You see, there is an internal conflict going on within every believer. The sinful nature and the Holy Spirit are at war in our hearts. Carl Sandburg (1878-1967) once put it this way: ""There is an eagle in me that wants to soar, and there is a hippopotamus in me that wants to wallow in the mud."" (Richard Hansen, ""A Good Mystery, Preaching Today Audio, Issue 253; www.Preaching Today.com) That ""hippopotamus"" is our own flesh, which is sinful by nature. So if we depend on our own flesh, i.e., if we depend on our own self effort, we end up sinning every time, because that's its nature. Dr. Loran Nordgren, a senior lecturer at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management in Chicago, ran a series of experiments that placed college students in ""tempting situations"" to smoke, eat junk food, or forgo studying. The research found that we often display what's called a ""restraint bias."" In other words, we tend to overestimate how much self-control we will have against temptation when we're not in the ""heat of the moment."" Our ""restraint bias"" causes us to think that we can handle more temptation than we actually can. In fact, Dr. Nordgren warned that ""Those who are most confident about their self-control are the most likely to give in to temptation."" (Jeanna Bryner, ""Temptation Harder to Resist Than You Think, Study Suggests,"" Live Science, 8-3-09; www.PreachingToday.com)"
Isaiah 40:3-5,"('Advent', 'Worship', 'Prayer', 'Prepare')",Assembly Of God,saiah 40:3," Prepare WHAG December 18th, 2016 You've probably noticed that we are doing the Christmas season a little different this year. We are celebrating the Advent Wreath, focusing more on prayer and meditation during the service, and trying to focus more on the real reason for the season. For years, around the time of my birthday on Dec 3rd, I'd look ahead to the Christmas season and say, ""This year- I'm going to focus on the real reason for the season. I'm not going to buy into the commercialism, the stress, the shopping, or the busyness. I'm going to focus on Jesus' coming to this earth. Then life smacks you in the face with a cold rag. If you work in Emergency care the Christmas season gets very busy, a lot of sleepless nights and tragic situations. On top of that, there is a natural increase in the demands of ministry and by the time Christmas Eve rolls around I just wanted it to be over and done with. So I wanted to do something a little different this year. One of the wisest sayings I've ever heard, in so many words the bible does address in several places is this saying- Your focus determines your reality. (repeat). What you focus on, is what you will become. This is the reason that God set so many seasons and feasts in the Old Testament- to remind us what is important in life. When you read your bibles and you get to books like the second part of Exodus and then Leviticus through Deuteronomy it really seems tedious to read all those laws and regulations and you start to wonder why Moses was so detailed in his descriptions. It was because our Father God knows the human heart- how easily it is for the enemy to take our eyes off God and cloud our vision with the worries and pursuits of our existence here on earth. In section of the bible we are going to read this morning in the book of Isaiah- this is what has happened to the people the prophet is addressing. For the 26 chapters preceding the verses we will read in a few moments, it's been all about God's wrath and coming judgement, which leads to the eventual exile of Israel into Babylon. And for 26 chapters and several decades, they ignored the prophet's warnings and finally the judgment has now come. Put yourself in their place- It is very conceivable that the people were living in regret now- ""If we had only listened, we'd be in our own nation, living under our own roofs, serving our own kings. Instead, here we are, little better than slaves in a foreign land where we are considered second class citizens"" Therefore, God instructs Isaiah to change the focus of his message. I found a great way to explain what is going on using the Preacher's Homiletical reference. The section we are about to read relate to the restoration of the Jews from their captivity in Babylon. In essence, they are the Gospel of the Old Testament. This is their value to us. To quickly summarize it, the ideas contained in the first five verses of this chapter are--That a glorious change awaits the exiles, consisting of a new and generous manifestation of Jehovah's presence, for which His people are exhorted to prepare."

John 4:1-42,"('Evangelism', 'Truth', 'Comfort Zone')",Baptist," Get Out of Your Comfort Zone February 5, 2017 Morning Service Immanuel Baptist Church, Wagoner, OK Rick Boyne Message Point: We must get out of our comfort zone to reach people for Jesus. Focus Passage: John 4:1-42 Supplemental Passage: but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth."" (Acts 1:8 NASB) Introduction: Samaritans - The name given to the new and mixed inhabitants whom Esarhaddon (677 B.C.), the king of Assyria, brought from Babylon and other places and settled in the cities of Samaria, instead of the original inhabitants whom Sargon (721 B.C.) had removed into captivity. These strangers amalgamated with the Jews still remaining in the land, and gradually abandoned their old idolatry and adopted partly the Jewish religion. After the return from the Captivity, the Jews in Jerusalem refused to allow them to take part with them in rebuilding the temple, and hence sprang up an open enmity between them. They erected a rival temple on Mount Gerizim, which was, however, destroyed by a Jewish king (130 B.C.). They then built another at Shechem. The bitter enmity between the Jews and Samaritans continued in the time of our Lord: the Jews had ""no dealings with the Samaritans"". Our Lord was in contempt called ""a Samaritan"" (Joh_8:48). [Easton] I. Had to Pass thru Samaria (v 4) a. Could have taken a different, route, but this one was the quickest b. Most Jews would do anything to avoid Samaria and Samaritans II.

Does it only involve subjects you know about like sports, or fishing, or knitting, or grandkids? Does it not involve going to even a different neighborhood? When you work for the Lord within your comfort zone, you are able to do things in your own power. But when you get outside your comfort zone, you must depend on the Lord's strength to get anything done. Get outside your comfort zone."
Mark 1:1-8,"('Faith', 'Repentance', 'True Repentance', 'Christ Exalted')",Baptist," Jesus Christ Proclaimed Mark 1: 1-8 As we begin our study in Mark's Gospel, it is interesting to note that he doesn't offer any genealogy of Christ, the events surrounding His birth, or any details about His childhood. These would have been essential to reach a Jewish audience, but Mark is writing with a Gentile audience in mind. He jumps right in, immediately proclaiming Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God. Mark 1:1 - The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Mark identified Him as Jesus, meaning ""Jehovah is salvation."" He proclaimed Him as Christ, the ""Jewish Messiah; the Anointed One."" He also affirmed that Jesus was in fact the Son of God. Mark declares to the reader that he intends to discuss the ""gospel"" of Jesus Christ. These opening words mark the beginning of the accounts surrounding the Gospel or ""good news"" of Jesus Christ. As we begin a verse by verse study of Mark's Gospel, I want to examine the details of this opening scene as we consider: Jesus Christ Proclaimed. I. A Prophecy Fulfilled (2-3) - Although Mark is appealing to a Gentile audience, he doesn't abandon or neglect the Jewish association or biblical prophecy regarding Christ. Clearly he seeks to reveal Jesus as the Christ, Savior and Redeemer of the world to all who will believe upon Him by faith. He begins by discussing a fulfilment of prophecy regarding Christ. Consider: A. John's Purpose (2) - As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. Mark spoke of prophecy given hundreds of years before the birth of Jesus concerning a prophet, sent from God, to prepare the way for Jesus. Mal.3:1 - Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts. This messenger was John the Baptist, sent to prepare the way for Jesus' ministry upon earth. John began to lay the groundwork for Jesus, calling on the people to repent of their sin and prepare for the coming of Christ the Lord, the Redeemer of men. B. John's Preaching (3) - The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. Mark also spoke of the message John faithfully preached prior to Jesus arriving on the scene. He was a lone voice, crying out in the desert places, calling the people to prepare for the coming of Messiah. Isaiah 40:3 - The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Few properly understand the life and ministry of John the Baptist. Although his life is recorded in the New Testament, following the silent years from Malachi to Matthew, he is actually the last of the Old Testament prophets. At this time in Israel's history, the Jews had become complacent and lost sight of genuine worship and service to the Lord. They found themselves consumed in a form of dead religion that promoted particular rituals and adherence to the law, instead of a personal, fulfilling relationship with the Lord. John came preaching against dead, orthodox religion, proclaiming the coming of Christ!"
"Numbers 10:11-13, Luke 9:28-43","(""God's Guidance"", ""God's Leading"", ""God's Care"")",Assembly Of God," Wandering in the Wilderness Introduction - I had just started working and was looking forward to building a career in the secular world. I was 24 at that time. About a year into my job, I started developing a pain at the back of my left leg, which kept getting progressively worse. Pain killers helped to take the pain away, but once they were stopped, the pain came back with greater discomfort. Eventually, my parents had me examined by a Surgeon. After checking me out, he asked me to be warded in hospital immediately since I had a problem on my spine. Thus began a very distressing period of my life. As God's children, sometimes He permits us to go through what I would like to call 'Wilderness Experiences'. These are places where it seems that God is far away, our problems are overcoming us and where our prayers don't seem to go further than the ceiling. In fact, it seems like they hit the ceiling and come back down again! Proposition - God will always be with us in the wilderness experiences. The question is how should we, as God's children, respond, when we start to wander in the wilderness? I would like to suggest 5 thoughts through this sermon, on the manner in which we should respond in these challenging periods of our life. 1) Accept that God is with you in the wilderness In Numbers 10:11-13, it says that God led the people into the desert of Paran. Yes, God led them. The word 'Paran' means beauty and it is important to understand that God wants to do something beautiful in us, in the wilderness. He doesn't permit us to go through the wilderness and leave us there by ourselves. Therefore, we should not back away from the desert. An encouraging quote says, 'If God brought us to it, He will take us through it'! Everyone likes the mountain-top experiences like Peter, James and John in Luke 9: 28-36. Yet, just ahead of them was a serious demonic battle (Luke 9:37-43)! For godly character and faith to be built, we need the valley moments as well. Recently I asked the congregation whether God's presence has been more intimate to them in the mountain-top or the wilderness experiences. They responded unanimously that it was in the latter! Why? Because it is in the wilderness that we find out that God knows us by name, that he takes our pain, and that He is faithful! A preacher once said, how can we experience healing, if we don't battle sickness? How can we find God's provision, if we don't have a need? Let us not forget that it was in the middle of a rough and bleak desert that God made the fantastic promise, ""I will not bring on you any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians, for I am the Lord, who heals you"" (Exodus 15:26)! Therefore, accept that God is with you in the midst of the pain or loneliness in the wilderness, and that He knows what He's doing. 'It is doubtful if God can bless a man greatly, unless he has been hurt deeply'. (Tozer) Illustration - Coming back to my story, after being warded in the hospital, I was disturbed, angry and questioning God. I had bad pain and much discomfort too as they had tied sandbags to my legs. It was one of the darkest periods of my life. People warned me that I could have serious medical consequences unless I got the problem sorted out. I struggled to pray and trust God, but eventually, the Holy Spirit touched me deeply and I began to accept that God was with me in the trial. He is with you too!"
"Acts 4:23-31, 2 Timothy 1:6-7","('Encouragement', 'Restoration', 'Passion For Christ', 'Faith Builder')",Church Of God,"cts 4:23-31 NKJV, “And being let go, they went to their own companions and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them. So when they heard that, they raised their voice to God with one accord and said: ""Lord, You are God, who made heaven and earth and the sea, and all that is in them, who by the mouth of Your servant David have said: 'Why did the nations rage, And the people plot vain things? The kings of the earth took their stand, And the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against His Christ.' ""For truly against Your holy Servant Jesus, whom You anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose determined before to be done. Now, Lord, look on their threats, and grant to Your servants that with all boldness they may speak Your word, by stretching out Your hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of Your holy Servant Jesus."" And when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldnes"," Serving the Lord with Passion Introduction: Tell the Story.......... I want to talk to you today about passion. Spiritual Passion! The kind of passion that motivated those guys in Acts chapter 4. What is Passion? Passion is an extremely strong emotion based on something very deep inside. It is more than just liking something or having an appreciation for a thing. For example, I like most all sports but I have a passion for football. It does not matter if my team is having a winning season or not, my passion for football remains. I have a deeper passion for my wife and family; even deeper than football if you can believe that. Spiritual Passion happens when someone has an up to date walk with Jesus that brings a burning zeal, or deep seated excitement that satisfies the soul and cannot be experienced outside of God. This kind of passion cannot be phony or put on. It is something that comes from deep inside the core of a person. 1. PASSION IS HEART FELT A. It does not come from rituals or ceremony or going through the motions B. This kind of passion cannot be maintained thru traditions C. The passion I am talking about comes from a dynamic, fire fed zeal of the ""Daily Bread"" and ""Daily Destiny"" type of walk. 2. DO WE WALK WITH CONVICTION OR GUILT? A. You cannot live a life of Spiritual Passion if you live a guilty/shame based existence. John 8:36 ""Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed."" B. You are not a sinner saved by grace, that's not who you are. You are the righteousness of God created unto good works. C. Put on the mind of Christ and live in the newness of Life. 3. JOHN 10:10 NKJV, ""The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly."" A. The thief wants to steal your joy and bring death. He has an agenda that is intended to bring you down. You don't have to live, or should I say, die like that!"
2 Timothy 2:14-26,"('Teach', 'Timothy', 'Lead', 'Preach')",Anglican," The reading from Paul's second letter to Timothy is part of the final letter Paul wrote. He wrote this letter from his prison cell in Rome, and he knew that he was about to be put to death. Both of his letters to Timothy contain instructions for both ministers and Christians. Paul tells ministers to teach, preach and lead. Shallow sermons lead to shallow saints, and mistaken preaching leads to misguided lives. It is a serious responsibility to teach or preach the Word of God. Good, sound, biblical teaching can build people up in their faith, while bad teaching can tear people down. Bad doctrine or bad preaching destroys faith and causes people to think and live wrongly. In contrast, good doctrine or preaching that is based on a right understanding of God's word of truth builds and strengthens faith. This can only be done when ministers handle God's word with the same care and precision that a good carpenter does with his tools and materials. Paul tells ministers to remind their congregations about how to resolve disputes, especially those caused by untrained or false teachers. People who follow after rumours and opinions are more than a nuisance. They are a threat to the church, and as such they must be dealt with quickly and decisively. When people try to understand God through worldly views instead of through the Holy Spirit's discernment or through studying God's Word, they are easily fooled by Satan's lies. The situation is made worse by untrained ministers. The danger in using an unapproved or untrained minister is that this person literally misses the target of God's teaching. As a result, he or she is prone to promoting false teachings, which can destroy the faith of other believers. Any doctrine that is not in accord with the Bible's teaching must be cut out just like a surgeon cuts out an appendix or cancerous tissue. If left untreated, it will only spread and make the body of Christ sick. The spiritual food of God's word keeps believers and the church healthy. There are four attitudes that can diffuse any controversial situation and allow believers to end foolish arguments without destroying opponents: 1. A gentle, tender spirit 2. A teaching spirit 3. A tolerant, patient spirit 4. A temperate, controlled spirit This form of correction has the potential to literally awaken people so that they may escape the enemy. The word ""patient"" means ""bearing evil without resentment."" Some people in Paul's time may have taken his teaching about the resurrection to the extreme, especially his rhetorical question about needing physical resurrection when we have been resurrected with Christ spiritually. Paul explains that the physical resurrection of believers is necessary for sin and death to be ultimately defeated. Christ's own physical resurrection guarantees a Christian's future, physical resurrection. The visible, professing church is pictured as a temple that has God as its foundation. It is made up of Christians and those who merely profess to be Christians. These servants are either honourable or dishonourable. God knows which ones are devoted to His use. He only wants holy people doing his work, and holy people are those who are cleansed from wrong conduct and wrong doctrine. Paul says that any dishonourable servants can become honourable servants if they get rid of wrong influences and earthly priorities."
Proverbs 22:1,"('Names Of God', 'Who Is God')",Church Of God," The Jehovah Names Of God Youtube at the beginning: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzqTFNfeDnE Youtube video at the end: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5-6gwssX0Y A person's name is important. It identifies you as being uniquely yourself. In Proverbs 22:1 the wise man said it best when he wrote ""A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favor rather than silver and gold."" Names are a part of us every day and in every way. We name everything. We call each other names when we are happy or when we are mad. We name our dogs, cars, boats, houses, and everything else you can think of. .... I name my hunting gun ""Sweet Betsy Lou"" and my Harley is named ""Sweet Pea."" I was at a conference once and I heard about a preacher that named his bed. He named it The Word. That way when someone called him late at night and said what are you doing he could honestly answer that he is in the Word. Names are important. In the Bible when something extraordinary happened to someone then that person would sometimes name the place appropriately. In our story Jacob named the place where his transformation happened. He named it Penuel. Names are important and they show importance. Names can show love and honor they can show respect and adoration. Names can show shame and humiliation, Names can change the whole outlook of various situations. Names are important. Names can vary and many names can be given to us or to God. In fact God has many names. I want to talk about some of those names because they give us very clear insights into various character traits of God, or functions of God or even reveals His heart and attitude for us. There are literally hundreds of names for God listed in the Bible and all of them are very important. So, let's take a very short look at just a few of them. 1. JEHOVAH-GMOLAH........ ""The God of Recompense"" Jeremiah 51:5-6 For Israel hath not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the Lord of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel. 6 Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the Lord's vengeance; he will render unto her a recompense. To recompense means to make amends to someone for loss or harm suffered; compensate. Compensation or reward given for loss or harm suffered or effort made. 2. JEHOVAH-MACCADDESHEM....... ""The Lord thy Sanctifier."" Exodus 31:13 ""That ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you."" To sanctify means ""To set a person apart and to cleanse from the stain of sin and clean up a person's life; enabling them to live a holy and sinless life."" 3. JEHOVAH-ROHI...... ""The Lord my Shepherd"" Psalms 23:1-4 ""The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. 2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. 3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. 4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me."""

Some of us even want to experience the extreme favor of God. The good news is that every one of us are eligible to live under the covering of God's favor is. It is a place of tremendous blessing but also extreme responsibility. Nonetheless, the favor of God will radically and profoundly change your life and the life of everyone around you in ways you can only imagine. According to Jeremiah, and I could also show you other biblical examples, each of us are divinely designed and individually created for a particular purpose and destiny. The reality is that not everyone discovers their purpose and destiny. But for those who seek out their purpose, they find that their obedience to their purpose discover themselves completely blessed and highly favored of God in a way that can never be experienced otherwise. So, as we begin this study, we must begin by understanding the ""Kingdom Law of Usage."" To understand this law and the Favor of God, we are going to base our teaching over the next few weeks on the Book of Ester and the biblical story of who she was, why and how she became queen and the things she had to overcome. Now guys, I know some of you are going to say, this is like a ""Chick Flick"" or a woman's bible story. But I am telling you that even though it is a story about a woman and from a woman's perspective, we can absolutely relate to the principles of favor we will discover in this story. The story begins with the king and his first wife Queen Vashti who lost her place in the Kingdom. It is a lengthy reading but we must read it all to get the picture. Ester 1:1-22 (New Living Translation), ""These events happened in the days of King Xerxes, who reigned over 127 provinces stretching from India to Ethiopia. 2 At that time Xerxes ruled his empire from his royal throne at the fortress of Susa. 3 In the third year of his reign, he gave a banquet for all his nobles and officials. He invited all the military officers of Persia and Media as well as the princes and nobles of the provinces. 4 The celebration lasted 180 days--a tremendous display of the opulent wealth of his empire and the pomp and splendor of his majesty. 5 When it was all over, the king gave a banquet for all the people, from the greatest to the least, who were in the fortress of Susa. It lasted for seven days and was held in the courtyard of the palace garden. 6 The courtyard was beautifully decorated with white cotton curtains and blue hangings, which were fastened with white linen cords and purple ribbons to silver rings embedded in marble pillars. Gold and silver couches stood on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and other costly stones."
Esther 1:1-22,"('Esther', 'The Favor Of God')",Church Of God," The Favor of God The Potential Principle Part 2 of a 3 Part Series Introduction: Today we are continuing with a very important series that will absolutely transform and revolutionize your life if you can get it. This really is one of the most important messages I could share with you. You see, all of us want the favor of God but you must understand that God's love for you and His favor are related but yet are two completely separate things. God loves us all the same, He is no respecter of persons; and that love is deep and intense. The favor of God is another thing entirely. ? Review: ? Part 1- Use it or lose it o Session 1 - Vashti o Session 2 - 7 Princes Now, as we begin this week's word, let's look at Esther. I will be primarily using the New King James Version this week. After the King basically banished Queen Vashti, he was looking for a new queen and this was a very big deal. Esther 2:1-4 NKJV, ""After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus subsided, he remembered Vashti, what she had done, and what had been decreed against her. 2 Then the king's servants who attended him said: ""Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king; 3 and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather all the beautiful young virgins to Shushan the citadel, into the women's quarters, under the custody of Hegai the king's eunuch, custodian of the women. And let beauty preparations be given them. 4 Then let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti."" This thing pleased the king, and he did so. Esther 2:2 NKJV Then the king's servants who attended him said: ""Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king; ? From all 127 Provinces ? Scholars tell us there were somewhere between 400-1500 contestants Esther 2:4 NKJV Then let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti."" This thing pleased the king, and he did so. ? God is looking for a church ? People He can use in His Kingdom for His purposes The first qualification was that the candidates must have POTENTIAL! Of course, the candidates must be virgins. And in this case, this parallel for us between Queen Esther and us, virginity means unstained and unspoiled by the world, by the flesh. This means the first thing God looks for is people who are completely committed and absolutely faithful. Some people wonder why God doesn't seem to bless them with His favor. But, when you begin to evaluate things, not everyone is as faithful, as obedient, and as spiritually pure as they need to be. And, God cannot fully use people like that or bless people like that, as much as he would like. ""A double minded man is unstable in all his ways."" All the candidates were beautiful and gifted. They had talents and abilities or they would not have been considered to start with. But, talent, beauty, giftedness and abilities are not always enough. We must take this thing farther. All the Young Virgins were put in care of Hegai ? His job was to Prepare them Esther 2:8-9 NKJV So it was, when the king's command and decree were heard, and when many young women were gathered at Shushan the citadel, under the custody of Hegai, that Esther also was taken to the king's palace, into the care of Hegai the custodian of the women."
Esther 3:1-5,"('Esther', 'Prayer', 'The Favor Of God')",Church Of God," The Favor of God Changing Things Through Prayer Part 3 of a 3 Part Series Esther 3:1-5 NKJV After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes who were with him. And all the king's servants who were within the king's gate bowed and paid homage to Haman, for so the king had commanded concerning him. But Mordecai would not bow or pay homage. Then the king's servants who were within the king's gate said to Mordecai, ""Why do you transgress the king's command?"" Now it happened, when they spoke to him daily and he would not listen to them, that they told it to Haman, to see whether Mordecai's words would stand; for Mordecai had told them that he was a Jew. When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow or pay him homage, Haman was filled with wrath. Before we go any farther, we need to take a little side trail and understand some of the background here. The entire nation of Israel was in bondage to first Babylon and now Persia since the Persians had defeated Babylon. And to further complicate things, the whole nation had been exiled to the area that is present day Iraq/Iran. All of this had happened because of Israel's rebellion against Jehovah. But there is another complication, a wrench thrown into the gears if you will. You see it all goes back to an incident that happened much earlier, years earlier, with the first King of Israel, Saul. 1 Samuel 15:7-9 NKJV And Saul attacked the Amalekites, from Havilah all the way to Shur, which is east of Egypt. 8 He also took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. 9 But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fatlings, the lambs, and all that was good, and were unwilling to utterly destroy them. But everything despised and worthless, that they utterly destroyed. You see, when Saul spared Agag, he blew it. He wanted to keep what God told him to destroy. But, he didn't do it. And now, a descendant of Agag, a man who never should have been born, was brewing up a plan to destroy the Jews. If you are not careful to obey the Lord you will find yourself dealing with the consequences of disobedience later. It will come back up to bite you later and can even derail your destiny. In Esther 3:1-5 that we just read, we can see that the writer takes extra time to describe exactly who Haman is, who his ancestors are and what he is like. When I see a list of names like that I like to stop and do that name identification thing. You know the meaning of the names and even some historical information related to the characters mentioned. So, let's look at it for a minute..... Agag = Roof; upper floor (oppression) Amalek = A people that licks up (steals resources) Hammedatha = He that troubles the law (lawless) Haman = Noise; tumult (intimidation) Mordecai = Contrition; bitter; bruising (broken) Esther = Secret, Hidden Star (born to shine, but...) So, we have this scenario. We see the oppression, the poverty, the lawlessness, the intimidation. We can also see the results of trying to live underneath all this. Mordecai and Esther are broken and hidden."
1 Samuel 10:1-13,"('Encouragement', 'Destiny', 'Spiritual Development', 'Journeys')",Church Of God," Saul's Prophetic Journey 1 Samuel 10:1-13 1 Samuel 10:1-13 KJV - Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the Lord hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance? 2 When thou art departed from me today, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son? 3 Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine: 4 And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands. 5 After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy: 6 And the Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man. 7 And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee. 8 And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do. 9 And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day. 10 And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them. 11 And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets? 12 And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets? 13 And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place. There is a calling or designed destiny of God for every person and there process of destiny must go through in order to be successful. I have never seen a successful person who has not been through Saul's Prophetic Journey. Even though we know that Saul blew it in the end, this young Saul was not that guy. His heart was humble and strong. So don't go hating on this young Saul, and learn from him; and lets learn from his journey. The Prophet Samuel = Appointed by God Every Journey begins with an appointment Every Journey begins with an anointing Acts 13:2 ""As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them."""
Leviticus 19:1-18,"('Holiness', ""God's Holiness"", 'Transparency', 'Progressive Holiness', 'Holiness And Life')",*other,atthew 5:38-48; Leviticus 19:1-2; 9-18; Psalm 119:33-," Theme: Holiness Today? The LORD welcomes us to live a life of holiness. 1. The Call to Holiness Is Universal 2. The Call to Holiness is Practical and Relational 3. The Call to Holiness is Transparent INTRO: Grace and peace from God our Father and from His Son Jesus Christ who came to take away the sin of the world. Our passages this morning deal with a singular them; the theme of holiness. But exactly what is holiness and what does it look like in our world today? +Is it the holy person or holiness the mystic that resides on the mountainside? + Is it the monk that is hidden away in some desolate desert monastery? +Is it the lady who has surrounded herself with a collection of spiritual crystals? + Is it the person who is sitting in a lotus position doing their best to capture ""nothingness""? Holiness and the idea of being holy are by many considered to be antiquated thoughts and concepts. Concepts left better for those who lived during the 18th or 19th century. Ideas better left for those living alone and away from the hustle and bustle of the 21st century. Many believe that a life of holiness is neither attainable and/or necessary. Some have even concluded that such notions as living a life of holiness has no place in the modern day Body of Christ. And yet, the Bible deals with the subjects of holy or holiness over 500 times. This morning, I would like for us to spend a few moments looking at the experience of holiness. Holiness as it is seen in both our Gospel passage and in the passage we read from the book of Leviticus (19:1-2; 9-18). Our passage in Leviticus is a part of what our Jewish friends call Par shah of Kedoshim; which means that is part of a section of the Torah reading that deals specifically with the idea and life of Holiness. The Par shah of Kedoshim includes all of Leviticus chapters nineteen and twenty. It is in this section that we find Moses sharing with the people a number of ways in which they can express their holiness. Moses provides dozens of mitzvoth's (divine commandments) that are to help them learn how to live a holy lifestyle. What can we take from this passage and other similar to it concerning holy and holiness? I. We quickly understand that The Call to Holiness is a Universal Call One of the things our Jewish friends point out to us very quickly here in the beginning verses of Leviticus 19 is the universal call of Holiness. The LORD GOD ALMIGHTY did not instruct Moses to limit this call to either the 120 spiritual leaders or even to the 12 Tribal leaders. Instead, Moses was called to speak to the whole congregation of Israel. That means to everyone. This is one of the few places in the Torah that we see that the LORD made a universal call. The LORD wanted everyone to understand that He was inviting them to experience a life of holiness. This call included both Jew and non-Jew. It included all those who had joined the Children of Israel when they were redeemed from Egypt. It included all those that joined them along their journey. The Lord's Call of Holiness is Universal and it is both a promise and a commandment."
Ezekiel 36:1,"('Renewal', 'Prophecy', 'Encouragement', 'Restoration')",Church Of God," Speak to Your Mountain Preparing for the return Part 1 of a 3 Part Series Ezek 36:1-12 NKJV, ""And you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, 'O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord! 2 Thus says the Lord God: ""Because the enemy has said of you, 'Aha! The ancient heights have become our possession,'""' 3 therefore prophesy, and say, 'Thus says the Lord God: ""Because they made you desolate and swallowed you up on every side, so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations, and you are taken up by the lips of talkers and slandered by the people"" 4 therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God! Thus says the Lord God to the mountains, the hills, the rivers, the valleys, the desolate wastes, and the cities that have been forsaken, which became plunder and mockery to the rest of the nations all around -- 5 therefore thus says the Lord God:""Surely I have spoken in My burning jealousy against the rest of the nations and against all Edom, who gave My land to themselves as a possession, with wholehearted joy and spiteful minds, in order to plunder its open country.""' 6 ""Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, the hills, the rivers, and the valleys, 'Thus says the Lord God: ""Behold, I have spoken in My jealousy and My fury, because you have borne the shame of the nations."" 7 Therefore thus says the Lord God: ""I have raised My hand in an oath that surely the nations that are around you shall bear their own shame. 8 But you, O mountains of Israel, you shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to My people Israel, for they are about to come. 9 For indeed I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown. 10 I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt. 11 I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bear young; I will make you inhabited as in former times, and do better for you than at your beginnings. Then you shall know that I am the Lord. 12 Yes, I will cause men to walk on you, My people Israel; they shall take possession of you, and you shall be their inheritance; no more shall you bereave them of children."" Throughout the Word, mountains are mentioned in significant ways. Abraham nearly sacrificed Isaac on the Mountains of Moriah. Moses received the Law of God on a mountain. The Prophet Isaiah was in a cave on a mountain when he heard the voice of God. Caleb was given a mountain as his inheritance. The Transfiguration was on a mountain Jesus would retreat to the mountain for R & R. Here in Ezekiel 36 we see a very powerful word concerning the mountain. The prophet was told to prophecy to the mountain. But this was not just any mountain. This was specifically called the Mountains of Israel. These were the mountains of Caleb and his descendants. These were the mountains of promise and prosperity. These were the fertile lands of Israel's orchards and fields. This was the center of their agricultural district; their economic backbone."
Ezekiel 36:22-38,"('Renewal', 'Prophecy', 'Restoration', 'New Heart')",Church Of God," Speak to Your Mountain The Renewal of Israel: A New Heart Part 2 of a 3 Part Series Ezek 36:22-38 NKJV ""Therefore say to the house of Israel, 'Thus says the Lord God: ""I do not do this for your sake, O house of Israel, but for My holy name's sake, which you have profaned among the nations wherever you went. 23 And I will sanctify My great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst; and the nations shall know that I am the Lord,"" says the Lord God, ""when I am hallowed in you before their eyes. 24 For I will take you from among the nations, gather you out of all countries, and bring you into your own land. 25 Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols. 26 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. 27 I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgments and do them. 28 Then you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; you shall be My people, and I will be your God. 29 I will deliver you from all your uncleannesses. I will call for the grain and multiply it, and bring no famine upon you. 30 And I will multiply the fruit of your trees and the increase of your fields, so that you need never again bear the reproach of famine among the nations. 31 Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight, for your iniquities and your abominations. 32 Not for your sake do I do this,"" says the Lord God, ""let it be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel!"" 33 'Thus says the Lord God: ""On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will also enable you to dwell in the cities, and the ruins shall be rebuilt. 34 The desolate land shall be tilled instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass by. 35 So they will say, 'This land that was desolate has become like the Garden of Eden; and the wasted, desolate, and ruined cities are now fortified and inhabited.' 36 Then the nations which are left all around you shall know that I, the Lord, have rebuilt the ruined places and planted what was desolate. I, the Lord, have spoken it, and I will do it."" 37 'Thus says the Lord God:""I will also let the house of Israel inquire of Me to do this for them: I will increase their men like a flock. 38 Like a flock offered as holy sacrifices, like the flock at Jerusalem on its feast days, so shall the ruined cities be filled with flocks of men. Then they shall know that I am the Lord.""'"" This is Part 2 of an incredible prophetic word God is giving. In the first part, we saw how God told the prophet to prophecy to the mountains. But remember, these were not just any mountains, these were the mountains of promise, prosperity and harvest but the land had become desolate because of the spiritual state of the people. He told the mountain to begin producing once again because God's people were coming back. It's a great message but I don't have time to re-preach it right now."
Ezekiel 36:28-38,"('Prosperity', 'Prophecy', 'Encouragement', 'Breakthrough')",Church Of God," Speak to Your Mountain The Renewal of Israel: The Multiplication of Men and Goods Part 3 of a 3 Part Series We have been talking for the past two sessions about the Prophetic Message of Ezekiel 36. In the first session the prophet was told to prophecy to the mountains and let the land know that God was bringing his people home. The mountains needed to begin producing provision for the people. In the second session, we saw how God was doing a sovereign work and would restore and return Israel to her ancestral home. He would restore his reputation among the nations by glorifying his name in the lives of the very people who had profaned his name. Then he would put a new heart in them. And so we pick up the teaching here in ..... Ezekiel 36:28 Then you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; you shall be My people, and I will be your God. 29 I will deliver you from all your uncleannesses. I will call for the grain and multiply it, and bring no famine upon you. 30 And I will multiply the fruit of your trees and the increase of your fields, so that you need never again bear the reproach of famine among the nations. 31 Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight, for your iniquities and your abominations. 32 Not for your sake do I do this,"" says the Lord God, ""let it be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel!"" 33 'Thus says the Lord God: ""On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will also enable you to dwell in the cities, and the ruins shall be rebuilt. 34 The desolate land shall be tilled instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass by. 35 So they will say, 'This land that was desolate has become like the Garden of Eden; and the wasted, desolate, and ruined cities are now fortified and inhabited.' 36 Then the nations which are left all around you shall know that I, the Lord, have rebuilt the ruined places and planted what was desolate. I, the Lord, have spoken it, and I will do it."" 37 'Thus says the Lord God:""I will also let the house of Israel inquire of Me to do this for them: I will increase their men like a flock. 38 Like a flock offered as holy sacrifices, like the flock at Jerusalem on its feast days, so shall the ruined cities be filled with flocks of men. Then they shall know that I am the Lord.""'"" Let's pick it back up with verse 28... Ezekiel 36:28 Then you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; you shall be My people and I will be your God. 29 I will deliver you from all your uncleannesses. I will call for the grain and multiply it, and bring no famine upon you. 30 And I will multiply the fruit of your trees and the increase of your fields, so that you need never again bear the reproach of famine among the nations. The prophetic word continues with a strong voice declaring that they will return to their homelands; but not only that they would return, but would return blessed. Not only would they be blessed, but God assures them that he will cleanse then and be their God. He says he will call for the grain and multiply it. So not only will there be grain, a staple food, but will also multiply it."
Psalms 103:1-12,"('Hope', 'Promise', 'Encouragement', 'Breakthrough')",Church Of God," Bless the Lord Psalms 103 Psalms 103:1-5 (New King James Version) Bless the Lord, O my soul; And all that is within me, bless His holy name! 2 Bless the Lord, O my soul, And forget not all His benefits: 3 Who forgives all your iniquities, Who heals all your diseases, 4 Who redeems your life from destruction, Who crowns you with lovingkindness and tender mercies, 5 Who satisfies your mouth with good things, So that your youth is renewed like the eagle's. INTRO: Today I am beginning a message; perhaps even a series of messages based upon my own personal studies. The thoughts and revelations are extensive, methodical and systematic; based upon Psalms 103. And, they are personal. I know that anything a preacher preaches should come from a personal place. But this is different.... This chapter of the Bible holds the foundation of some of my most personal and private devotions to the Lord. And even though I have preached out of Psalms 103 many times; never have I walked a church or even a Bible Study Group through it the way I am bringing this to you. So, over the next few weeks, you are going to get it the way it sits in my heart. You are going to get Systematic Theology of Psalms 103 according to Larry. So, there is a lot to be said about this Psalm of David. It reveals so much about our covenant and my/our personal relationship with God that it completely overwhelms me. I do mean it goes as deep as it gets in my spirit. And besides just me, this chapter of the Bible is so anointed that countless people are healed, delivered and set free of their present issues and their painful past just by reading it. It starts out by saying, ""Bless the Lord, O my soul; And all that is within me, bless His holy name! 2 Bless the Lord, O my soul."" Our relationship with God is both corporate and personal. It is corporate in the sense that we serve the Lord together. That means we come together in unity on a regular basis and blend our hearts and singing and serving together. When we do, there is a very special anointing that comes with it. Psalms 139 says, ""Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! 2 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments; 3 As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore."" When we come together with no other agenda than to lift up the Lord and to encourage and support one another, the anointing that accompanies our worship moves mountains and causes miracles to happen in our midst. There is something special about faith joined to faith; hearts joined to hearts; having the same mind. It creates a spiritual energy that shifts dimensions and opens the portals of heavenly glory. But listen up, if we don't have any depth in our personal relationship with the Lord, we don't have any business putting on the act when we get together like you are some kind of super-saint or something."
Psalms 103:1-12,"('Hope', 'Promise', 'Encouragement', 'Spiritual Benefits')",Church Of God," Forget not all His Benefits Psalms 103 Part 2 of a Series As I mentioned last week, we are spending a little time in Psalms 103. Not only is it one of the most encouraging books of the Bible, its truths will completely transform your life into a more blessed life than you could ever imagine. The way I am preaching this is a little different that the normal because the way I study and understand this scripture is a little different. When I was a young Christian, first starting my personal spiritual journey, there were a few sections of the Bible that jumped out at me in a really big way. Romans 8 was one of those, Isaiah chapters 43-65, The Sermon on the Mount; and then there was Psalms 103. As I would study these verses, I was really hungry to know what they really meant and spent some serious time trying to apply and activate their truth and meanings into my lifestyle. And so, I prayed over what I read and then would cross reference these verses to see how they were supported in other places in the Bible. As I did so, an amazing transformation came over me. My mind began to adjust to the new way of thinking, my heart began to come alive to spiritual mysteries and my body began to obey my heart rather than the carnal flesh. So, these sermons are just some of the revelations I received while running down everything I could learn; devour really. Psalms 103:1-5 (New King James Version) Bless the Lord, O my soul; And all that is within me, bless His holy name! 2 Bless the Lord, O my soul, And forget not all His benefits: 3 Who forgives all your iniquities, Who heals all your diseases, 4 Who redeems your life from destruction, Who crowns you with lovingkindness and tender mercies, 5 Who satisfies your mouth with good things, So that your youth is renewed like the eagle's. Intro: A young minister was about to deliver his first sermon, and asked a retired minister-friend for advice on how to capture the congregation's attention. ""Start with an opening line that's certain to grab them,"" the older man said. ""For example: 'Some of the best years of my life were spent in the arms of a woman who was not my wife.'"" He smiled at the younger man's shocked expression before adding, ""She was my mother."" The next Sunday the young preacher gets up there and nervously clutched the pulpit. Finally he said, ""Some of the best years of my life were spent in the arms of a woman."" He was pleased at the instant reaction--then he became all tongue tied and panic-stricken and said. ""But for the life of me, I can't remember who she was!"" Forgetfulness can be a tremendous problem, often getting us into terrible predicaments. How many times have you been embarrassed by forgetting someone's name? How many appointments have been missed or opportunities slipped by simply because we forgot about them? What have you forgotten this morning? Can't think of anything? Then you may well have forgotten much! Entire industries are built upon the manufacture and sale of memory aids. My life has been saved numerous times by my calendar and sticky notes ... as long as I remember write stuff down. I once read of a man who went to a training conference where a course was being taught on how to improve one's memory. He spent nearly $200 on the books, tapes and worksheets for the course and then brought them home, stored them in a convenient location, and then he forgot where he put them."
Psalms 103:1-12,"('Forgiveness', 'Hope', 'Encouragement')",Church Of God," Psalms 103:1-5 Part 3 of a Series TEXT: Psalms 103:1-5 NKJV Bless the Lord, O my soul; And all that is within me, bless His holy name! 2 Bless the Lord, O my soul, And forget not all His benefits: 3 Who forgives all your iniquities, Who heals all your diseases, 4 Who redeems your life from destruction, Who crowns you with lovingkindness and tender mercies, 5 Who satisfies your mouth with good things, So that your youth is renewed like the eagle's. In his book. Lee: The Last Years, Charles Bracelen Flood reports that after the Civil War, Robert E. Lee visited a Kentucky lady who took him to the remains of a grand old tree in front of her house. There she bitterly cried that its limbs and trunk had been destroyed by Federal artillery fire. She looked to Lee for a word condemning the North or at least sympathizing with her loss. After a brief silence, Lee said, ""Cut it down, my dear Madam, and forget it."" It is better to forgive the injustices of the past than to allow them to remain, let bitterness take root and poison the rest of our life. Many Christians are living defeated lives, because they are hanging onto their pasts. They see their sins more than they see the solution to their sins, which is the blood of Jesus! They spend more of their time dwelling on their sins, then dwelling on what Jesus has done for them! Repentance - the key to being forgiven Proverbs 28:13, ""He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy."" If you can confess it, you can be forgiven of it! It doesn't matter what you've done, if you turn to God and confess your sins, He will forgive ALL of your unrighteousness... that includes anything you've done, that you are willing to bring before Him! 1 John 1:9, ""If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from ALL unrighteousness."" There is no sin too great for God to forgive: Titus 2:14, ""Who gave Himself for us to redeem us from EVERY lawless deed, and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds."" (NASB) Isaiah 1:18, ""Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool."" The only sin God can't forgive, is the one you won't take to Him!! Did you know that it's the goodness of God; when we realize His great love for us, which is supposed to draw or lead you to repent and turn to Him? Romans 2:3-4 The Message - You didn't think, did you, that just by pointing your finger at others you would distract God from seeing all your misdoings and from coming down on you hard? 4 Or did you think that because he's such a nice God, he'd let you off the hook? Better think this one through from the beginning. God is kind, but he's not soft. In kindness he takes us firmly by the hand and leads us into a radical life-change. Also look at Jeremiah 31:3, ""...Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee."""
Psalms 103:1-12,"('Healing', 'Hope', 'Promise', 'Encouragement')",Church Of God," Psalms 103:1-5 Part 4 of a 4 Part Series TEXT: Psalms 103:1-5 NKJV Bless the Lord, O my soul; And all that is within me, bless His holy name! 2 Bless the Lord, O my soul, And forget not all His benefits: 3 Who forgives all your iniquities, Who heals all your diseases, 4 Who redeems your life from destruction, Who crowns you with lovingkindness and tender mercies, 5 Who satisfies your mouth with good things, So that your youth is renewed like the eagle's. We are on part 4 of a series out of Psalms 103 where it says to not forget all the benefits of serving the Lord. The way it is worded, the chapter goes on to list some of those benefits and we are looking at some of them in this series. Today we are taking a look at verse three where is says God heals all our diseases. In light of all this, I want to take you to the book of Matthew. Matt 10:5-8 NLT ""Jesus sent out the twelve apostles with these instructions: ""Don't go to the Gentiles or the Samaritans, 6 but only to the people of Israel--God's lost sheep. 7 Go and announce to them that the Kingdom of Heaven is near. 8 Heal the sick, raise the dead, cure those with leprosy, and cast out demons. Give as freely as you have received!"" I want you to notice that in verse 8, Jesus commands his disciples -- that's us -- to heal the sick. Divine Healing is our right, part of our inheritance in Christ, and is even called ""the Children's Bread"" in Mt. 15:26. Many large corporations and most governmental jobs offer ""Fringe Benefits"" that are worth almost as much as the salary. Examples of these Benefits are: Health Insurance e. Company Car Workers Comp. f. Retirement Paid Vacation g. Profit Sharing Sick Pay Listen as the Psalmist begins to recount some of the Lord's fringe benefits: ""Praise the Lord, O my soul; all my inmost being, praise his holy name. Praise the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits-- who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases"" Ps. 103:1-3. For Christians, our main benefit or reward is eternal life; but there are many fringe benefits such as physical healing, guidance, material provision, doors being opened for us, etc. God wants us to have confidence and think it normal, to pray for the sick and expect them to be healed. Why should we think that it is possible for the Lord to heal our diseases and injuries? God is by nature a healing God. Satan, on the other hand, has come to kill, steal, and destroy; but Jesus says, ""I have come that you might have life, abundantly."" In Ex. 15:26, God says, ""I am the Lord that heals you."" Just days before, the Israelites ate the Passover Lamb which was equivalent to SALVATION. They then crossed the Red Sea, in which Paul declared they were BAPTIZED (1 Cor. 10:2). 1 Cor 10:1-5 NLT ""I don't want you to forget, dear brothers and sisters, about our ancestors in the wilderness long ago. All of them were guided by a cloud that moved ahead of them, and all of them walked through the sea on dry ground. 2 In the cloud and in the sea, all of them were baptized as followers of Moses. 3 All of them ate the same spiritual food, 4 and all of them drank the same spiritual water. For they drank from the spiritual rock that traveled with them, and that rock was Christ."""
2 Corinthians 3:17-18,"('Transformed Life', 'Transformed', 'Renewed')",Church Of God," Living a Transformed Life 2 Corinthians 3:17-18, NLT ""For the Lord is the Spirit, and wherever the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. 18 So all of us who have had that veil removed can see and reflect the glory of the Lord. And the Lord--who is the Spirit--makes us more and more like him as we are changed into his glorious image."" I want to begin with a brief excerpt from a book by Mark Buchanan called, ""Your Church is Too Safe."" This appeared in the March 2012 issue of Christianity Today. Historian Daniel Boorstin documents a momentous shift that occurred in North America in the nineteenth century: we stopped calling people who went on trips travelers and started calling them tourists. Traveler literally means ""one who travails."" He labors, suffers, endures...To get there, he immerses himself in a culture, learns the language and customs, lives with the locals, imitates the dress, eats what's set before him. He takes risks, some enormous, and makes sacrifices, some extravagant. He has tight scrapes and narrow escapes. He is gone a long time. If ever he returns, he returns forever altered .... A tourist, not so. Tourist means, literally, ""one who goes in circles."" He's just taking an exotic detour home. He's only passing through, sampling wares, acquiring souvenirs... He retreats each night to what's safe and familiar. He picks up a word here, a phrase there, but the language, and the world it's embedded in, remains opaque and cryptic, and vaguely menacing. He spectates and consumes. He returns to where he's come from with an album of photos, a few mementos, and a cheap hat. He's happy to be back. He declares there's no place like home. We've made a similar shift in the church. At some point we stopped calling Christians disciples and started calling them believers. A disciple is one who follows and imitates Jesus. He loses his life in order to find it. He dives into the language and culture of Christ until His Word and His world reshape his, redefines him, change inside out how he sees and thinks and dreams and, finally, lives .... A believer, not so. He holds certain beliefs, but how deep down these go depends on the weather or his mood. He can get defensive, sometimes intensely so, about his beliefs, but in his honest moments he wonders why they've made such little difference .... You can't be a disciple without being a believer. But--here's the rub--you can be a believer and not a disciple. You can say all the right things, think all the right things, believe all the right things, do all the right things, and still not follow and imitate Jesus. The kingdom of God is made up of travailers, but our churches are largely populated with tourists. The kingdom is full of disciples, but our churches are filled with believers. At New Life City Church we value life transformation, not just information -- our learning must lead to Christ-like living. Romans 12:1-2 says NLT, ""And so, dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God because of all he has done for you. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice--the kind he will find acceptable. This is truly the way to worship him."
Mark 10:46-52,"('Faith', 'Healing', 'Breakthrough', 'How To Receive From The Lord')",Church Of God," How to Receive From the Lord Mark 10:46-52 King James Version, ""And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging. 47 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me. 48 And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me. 49 And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee. 50 And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus. 51 And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight. 52 And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way."" The man we know as Blind Bartimaeus was not considered to be anything special or important. He was born blind and was a beggar, a panhandler all his life. Every morning friends would lead him to the gate of the city where he would beg for his living. He had nothing going for himself and was more of a liability than an asset. He was named Bartimaeus, son of Timaeus. The name Bartimaeus means ""Honorable, son of one who is esteemed."" If names mean anything, Bartimaeus was living far below what God had planned for him. He was also called son of Timaeus and Timaeus means ""Highly prized but polluted."" You see, Bartimaeus was supposed to be honorable but his generational heritage was polluted and he now found himself to be a blind man and living far below his privilege. And to top it all off, he lived in Jericho. The name Jericho means ""A place to breathe, to smell with pleasure."" You see, you can be in a good place but in a bad way. You can be in a prosperous place but not be living a favored and blessed life because of ........ So, here is Blind Bartimaeus hanging out at Jericho's gate when he hears a commotion and word travels down to him as it does, telling him that Jesus of Nazareth had come to Jericho and was now leaving the city. And, not just leaving the city but actually entering through this particular gate where Blind Bartimaeus was stationed that day. Now, Jesus had gained a lot of popularity and was getting very well known by this time in His ministry so a lot of people were mighty curious..... Jesus had experienced a very successful campaign in Jericho. Bartimaeus knew Jesus was a healer, a miracle producing prophet. So he knew this was his chance, perhaps his only chance. How often would the blind beggar ever be this close to Jesus again given the circumstances? There was something desperate within him that began to cry out, ""Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me."" And when he wasn't sure that he was being heard over the crowd, he yelled it even louder, and louder and louder until he was making a spectacle of himself."
Exodus 15:22-27,"('Faith', 'Bitterness', 'Overcoming', 'Persistence Pays Off')",Church Of God," From Mara to the Wells of Elim Exodus 15:22-27 NKJV ""So Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea; then they went out into the Wilderness of Shur. And they went three days in the wilderness and found no water. 23 Now when they came to Marah, they could not drink the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore the name of it was called Marah. 24 And the people complained against Moses, saying, ""What shall we drink?"" 25 So he cried out to the Lord, and the Lord showed him a tree. When he cast it into the waters, the waters were made sweet. There He made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there He tested them, 26 and said, ""If you diligently heed the voice of the Lord your God and do what is right in His sight, give ear to His commandments and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have brought on the Egyptians. For I am the Lord who heals you."" 27 Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve wells of water and seventy palm trees; so they camped there by the waters. I love the whole story of the Exodus and all the Israelites went through from 430 years of slavery in Egypt until they finally possessed the land of Canaan 45 years after they crossed the Red Sea. The story I just read happens immediately after they crossed the Red Sea on dry ground after God parted the waters. You know, there is a lot we can gain from this story by walking through the Word step by step. It starts out with the fact that they crossed the Red Sea and then the whole nation walked three days into the Wilderness of Shur. The Wilderness of Shur means the ""Point of Observation."" So, up to this time things have been a whirlwind in you will. They have seen the 10 plagues, Pharaoh's harshness, subsequently Pharaoh's release of the Israelites, then his change of mind and his pursuit to get them back. They were pinned up next to the sea with seemingly no escape. Then they saw the Red Sea parted and a supernatural wind blowing on the seabed all night drying it out while God supernaturally kept the Egyptians at bay. Finally they were given the go ahead to cross the sea which they did as they witnessed the demise of the Egyptian army. And finally they are across the Red Sea and apparently safe. And now, the Israelites have entered the Wilderness of Shur or the Point of Observation. They have reached a place where they can take stock of their situation, catch their breath and try to make sense of it all. But their Point of Observation was view from the wilderness, not the final destination. So their observation was a little biased and tainted by their recent past experiences. Sometimes when we are in a difficult place in life we need to stop and find a point of observation to kind of take inventory and process everything that has taken place. Let me ask you a question.... Have you ever felt as if God helped you out of a terrible jam just to put you in a bigger hole? That was what the Israelites were feeling when they walked three days into Shur, the Point of Observation just to find out they made it to Mara, the ""Place of Bitterness."" I mean, we can only go about three days without water and they were three days away from the Red Sea.... How were they going to make it?"
Deuteronomy 7:1-6,"('Faith', 'Encouragement', 'Empowerment', 'Overcoming Great Odds')",Church Of God," Destroying the Seven Nations TEXT: Deuteronomy 7:1-6 New Living Translation, ""When the Lord your God brings you into the land you are about to enter and occupy, he will clear away many nations ahead of you: the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. These seven nations are greater and more numerous than you. 2 When the Lord your God hands these nations over to you and you conquer them, you must completely destroy them. Make no treaties with them and show them no mercy. 3 You must not intermarry with them. Do not let your daughters and sons marry their sons and daughters, 4 for they will lead your children away from me to worship other gods. Then the anger of the Lord will burn against you, and he will quickly destroy you. 5 This is what you must do. You must break down their pagan altars and shatter their sacred pillars. Cut down their Asherah poles and burn their idols. 6 For you are a holy people, who belong to the Lord your God. Of all the people on earth, the Lord your God has chosen you to be his own special treasure."" INTRO: It is obvious that we, all of us, are entering a new season. And, transition & change is not always easy for everyone; but it's necessary if God's plan for the new season is to become a reality. In Joshua 3:9-17 there is a about the story of Joshua leading the Nation of Israel across the Jordan River in order to possess the Promised Land. As that passage in the Book of Joshua starts out, the story begins with this statement. ""So Joshua told the Israelites, ""Come and listen to what the Lord your God says. 10 Today you will know that the living God is among you. He will surely drive out the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites ahead of you. 11 Look, the Ark of the Covenant, which belongs to the Lord of the whole earth, will lead you across the Jordan River!"" Interesting isn't it? The same seven nations are listed here in Joshua as are listed in Deuteronomy. In order to possess the promise, these seven nations must be utterly destroyed. If not, they will cause you to merge with and intermarry with them, compromising who you are and cause you to backslide and turn away from the Lord. As I studied these seven nations, I found some amazing parallels, some similarities between what Israel had to deal back in the day, and what we must overcome to inherit and occupy the things which God has promised us today. The first thing I want to note is that the Bible specifically identified each nation by name and then said, ""These nations are greater and more numerous than you."" This tells me that within my own ability, I am powerless to defeat these stronghold nations by myself or even with the help of any earthly army I can mobilize. The Bible says, in 1 Peter 5:8-9 ""Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour. 9 Stand firm against him, and be strong in your faith."" So, the devil is like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour. What is the purpose of a Lion's Roar? Incredibly, the roar of a lion can be heard by the human ear for up to five miles if conditions are right. And, one of the purposes of his roar is to establish territory. He wants to be king of all the territory in which he roams. It's the same for the devil, he wants to establish rulership of your territory. Yet the word says to stand firm against him and be strong in your faith."
1 Kings 19:8-9,"('Renewal', 'Renewing The Mind', 'Cave Time', 'Recharging')",Church Of God," Cave Time Word of Life - January 29th, 2012 Intro: About 10 years ago, I was attending a meeting where a highly anointed Prophet was ministering. At the conclusion of the service he called me out and began to prophecy over me. In this Word from the Lord, several things were said to me that were absolutely life changing. He called me an eagle; which was ironic because there was no way of knowing that God often revealed things to me through the eagle. Then he said that as an Eagle I was entering a ""waiting upon the Lord time"" and I would be sent to the cave for a season. While in that cave, other eagles would feed and take care of me. I would molt my eagle feathers, beak and talons; and it would take a while for my new feathers and things to grow back....... But do not fret, God would be with me in the cave, even though I would feel lost and vulnerable; it would be a good time. A healing time, a renewing time, a recharging time. It would be a refreshing time. And I would come out of it better than ever. And you know, that word was a very accurate word. I did go to the cave spiritually. And I experienced everything the Prophet said I would and more. I do not want to repeat it but am very thankful for my cave time. I would not be where I am today were it not for the cave. Some of you are saying to yourselves, what's all this about the cave? So, okay..... let's talk about it. Text: 1 Kings 19:8-9 NLT, ""So he got up and ate and drank, and the food gave him enough strength to travel forty days and forty nights to Mount Sinai, the mountain of God. 9 There he came to a cave, where he spent the night."" Why do we find Elijah the mighty prophet of God hiding in a cave? We find the answer earlier in this chapter -1 Kings 19:1-9 ""When Ahab got home, he told Jezebel everything Elijah had done, including the way he had killed all the prophets of Baal. 2 So Jezebel sent this message to Elijah: ""May the gods strike me and even kill me if by this time tomorrow I have not killed you just as you killed them."" 3 Elijah was afraid and fled for his life. He went to Beersheba, a town in Judah, and he left his servant there. 4 Then he went on alone into the wilderness, traveling all day. He sat down under a solitary broom tree and prayed that he might die. ""I have had enough, Lord,"" he said. ""Take my life, for I am no better than my ancestors who have already died."" 5 Then he lay down and slept under the broom tree. But as he was sleeping, an angel touched him and told him, ""Get up and eat!"" 6 He looked around and there beside his head was some bread baked on hot stones and a jar of water! So he ate and drank and lay down again. 7 Then the angel of the Lord came again and touched him and said, ""Get up and eat some more, or the journey ahead will be too much for you."" 8 So he got up and ate and drank, and the food gave him enough strength to travel forty days and forty nights to Mount Sinai, the mountain of God. 9 There he came to a cave, where he spent the night."" Elijah goes from the mountain top victory over the Prophets of Baal, to a Juniper tree and from there Elijah's next stop is a cave"

Jeremiah 6:13-16,"('Return Of Christ', 'Live As A Christian', 'Compassion For Lost', 'Back Track')",Baptist," LET'S WALK IN THE OLD PATHS Jeremiah 6: 16 Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein. We find Judah was in backslidden position. Jeremiah 6: 13 For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. 14 They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. 15 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the LORD. Many people today are in the same condition as well as some Church's. Many saved people are following the Lord to far off they have departed from the old path. Jeremiah 2: 11 Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit. 12 Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the LORD. 13 For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water. God called on Judah to return to the old paths and he would give them rest for their souls. (1) Return to prayer. Luke18: 1 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint; Elijah did 1st Kings18: 36 And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word. 37 Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again. Moses did. Exodus 32: 31 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. 32 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. Christ commands we pray. Matthew 7: 7 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: 8 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. The early Church was a praying Church. Began with prayer Acts 1: 13 And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. 14 These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren. Continued in prayer."
Psalms 103:1-5,"('Faith', 'Remember', 'Trust', ""God's Promises"", ""Don't Forget"")",Seventh-Day Adventist," REMEMBER We Complain Because we Forget I am stunned every time I read the story of the Exodus. How can the people of Israel complain like they do? How could they be so ignorant, so stupid, so forgetful? The God of the universe had just tossed around the most powerful man on the face of the earth like a toddler with a rag doll. God didn't just humble Pharaoh; he broke his spirit and revealed Pharaoh's impotence. A slave people and their God left him and his nation in shambles. This display of power sent vibrations throughout the world, inspiring fear and awe. Key Text : Psalms 103:1-5 Four parts. The Deadly Disease of Spiritual Amnesia Yet Israel's response to this spectacular deliverance from Egypt is not mainly praise, worship and whole-hearted trust. Instead, Israel responds with grumbling--complaining, murmuring, quarreling. ""No water, Moses! Where's the beef, Moses? I have blisters on my feet, Moses. Who died and made you boss? Are we there yet, Moses?"" Spiritual amnesia set in quickly and covered the eyes of Israel's hearts. So soon had they forgotten God's gracious and miraculous deliverance? This spiritual amnesia--forgetting God's deliverance and provision--is a deadly disease. The people of Israel, on the heels of unthinkable miracles, with their pockets full of Egyptian jewelry, grumble at their less-than-five-star accommodations in the desert. This wasn't just headache-induced grumbling or low-blood-sugar complaining. This was faithlessness. It is the heart that says, ""I know better than God. If only he would follow my plan."" Why We Complain And yet that's my heart and yours. ""Where's the dinner, honey? Leftovers again? Where's the protein? Is that all you got done today? Can you change the dirty diaper? What's this sticky stuff on the chair?"" I can be just like the people of Israel. ""I know you've forgiven all my sins at the cross, rescued me from eternal conscious torment and given me everlasting joy in your presence, but all we have for dinner is Ramen or Cheerios."" Grumbling, whining and thanklessness are not ultimately the heart's responses to circumstances, but to God. Israel grumbled at their enslavement, grumbled when Moses came on the scene and still grumbled as they wandered safely in the wilderness. Their complaining wasn't rooted in their scenery, but their heart. The same is true for you. A heart of gratitude and thankfulness isn't dependent on your bank statement, doctor's diagnosis or the praise you receive for a job well done. Thanklessness and grumbling--regardless of your situation, even your suffering--reflect your heart. They are sin. Spiritual amnesia is a deadly disease that threatens your faith and your joy more than any cancer. It penetrates to the core and rots your heart from within. Chemotherapy of the Soul How can we guard ourselves from this spiritual forgetfulness? How can we root out the cancer that threatens our joy and faith? Very simply, the antidote is to remember. Remember God's gracious deliverance and redemption. Establish it in your memory. Memorialize it. Paint it on the walls of your house. Journal it and reread it each morning."

John heard a great voice emanating from the *temple; it commands the *angels to pour out their bowls ""on the earth;"" later on, the voice is heard saying, ""It is done"" (Revelation 16:17). There the voice is said to come from the *throne; it seems likely that this voice and the voice in the first verse is the same--the divine voice from the *throne itself. This event, and the remaining judgments, belongs to the period when the term of the *beast's power has expired, and close to the end, or coming of the Son of man. And it may be further observed, that these bowls are only poured out on the enemies of God and of Christ, and of His church and people; for no wrath can be poured out upon the saints, not a single drop can fall upon them, because that would not be consistent with God's everlasting love for them. ""Go"" your respective ways, and fulfill the task assigned to each of you. ""Pour out the seven bowls of God's wrath."" God told the seven *angels to go and to empty the bowls on the earth. The bowls contained the anger of God. In other words, the people would know how angry God was because of the bowls. When each *angel poured each bowl, there would be terrible troubles on the earth. It was as if the bowls contained the actual troubles. Please remember, that at this time in the tribulation, the Lord's wrath is in full force! No more ""mister nice guy"" to those whom have rejected the Savior: the inhabitants of the earth being ripe for those judgments which the justice of God had appointed for their punishment. The punishment will be upon *antichrist, the vengeance of God will fall upon those that have the mark of the *beast, and the worshipers of his image, and it is easy to observe, that there is in many of these bowls an allusion to the plagues of Egypt. Note the comparison: In the first bowl (Revelation 16:2), to the plague of boils (Exodus 9:8). In the second and third bowls (Revelation 16:3), to that of turning the waters of Egypt into blood (Exodus 7:19). In the fourth bowl (Revelation 16:10), to the darkness that was over all the land of Egypt (Exodus 10:21)."
1 John 2:3-6,"('Belief', 'Trust', 'Change', 'Choice')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Lord change me! 1 John 2:3-6 Voice 3 We know we have joined Him in an intimate relationship because we live out His commands. 4 If someone claims, ""I am in an intimate relationship with Him,"" but this big talker doesn't live out His commands, then this individual is a liar and a stranger to the truth. 5 But if someone responds to and obeys His word, then God's love has truly taken root and filled him. This is how we know we are in an intimate relationship with Him: 6 anyone who says, ""I live in intimacy with Him,"" should walk the path Jesus walked. Illus. By Gregory McDonald Sr. Well, one way to respond to opportunity is to learn to recognize it even when it is disguised as difficulty. In a famous study by Victor and Mildred Goertzel, the home backgrounds of 300 highly successful people were investigated. All 300 of these people made it to the top of their respected fields. And they were names all of us would probably recognize...like Franklin Roosevelt, Helen Keller, Albert Schweitzer, Clara Barton, Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Ghandi... Well here is what the study revealed. Three-fourths of these people were troubled in childhood by either poverty, broken homes, rejection, or over possessive or dominating parents. 74 of the 85 writers of fiction or drama--and 16 of the 20 poet--came from homes where, as children, they saw or experienced physical, emotional, or spiritual abuse. More than 75 were victims of physical handicaps such as blindness, deafness, or crippled limbs. And yet every one of them somehow recognized the ""advantage of disadvantage"" ...and became the people God had called them to be. It's amazing that some people automatically conclude that difficulty, adversity, obstacles and objections are signs that God is closing the door of opportunity. And most of the time that is just not true! If a person is going through life with no spiritual guidance or relationship with God in their lives, closed doors represent what they think is yet another roadblock on the path to their self controlled destiny! However Closed doors are not missed opportunities, if you are truly letting God lead and direct your life! What they are is friendly stop signs along the way God puts there to say, hey this is not the way! Let me Spare you the drama of going down the wrong way street you are about to regret. If you are trusting God with your future and destiny, there is no physical limitations that can hold a person back achieving what God has for them! Unless they think their limitations are bigger than Gods ability to help them in spite of what they think their limitations are! Did you know that there are people who think that life being unfair, is a limitation? Did you know that there are people that think their personal circumstance at any given time, is a limitation? Did you know that there are people, because of their upbringing or their social status feel that is also a limitation? Even while those things sometimes feel like limitations, those are self-imposed limitations. And I say that not to make light of any persons situation, but because they can all be overcome with Gods help, sooner rather then later. And none of them are permanent, unless a person chooses to make them permanent!"
1 Corinthians 2:9,"('Faith', 'Trust', 'Obedience', 'Favor')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Gods word Never returns void! Illus. By Tim Harrison The story is told of a group of women that met for Bible study. While studying in the book of Malachi, chapter three, they came across verse three which says: ""He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver."" This verse puzzled the women and they wondered how this statement applied to the character and nature of God. One of the women offered to find out more about the process of refining silver, and to get back to the group at their next Bible study. The following week, the woman called up a silversmith and made an appointment to watch him while at work. She didn't mention anything about the reason for her interest, beyond her curiosity about the process of refining silver. As she watched the silversmith work, he held a piece of silver over the fire and let it heat up. He explained that in refining silver, one needed to hold the silver in the middle of the fire, where the flames were the hottest as to burn away all the impurities. The woman thought about God holding us in such a hot spot, then she thought again about the verse, that ""He sits as a refiner and purifier of silver."" She asked the silversmith if it was true that he had to sit there in front of the fire the entire time the silver was being refined. The man answered yes, that not only did he have to sit there holding the silver, but he had to keep his eyes on it the entire time it was in the fire. If the silver was left even a moment too long in the flames, it would be destroyed. The woman was silent for a moment. Then she asked the silversmith, ""But how do you know when the silver is fully refined?"" He smiled at her and answered, ""Oh, that's easy--when I see my image in it."" Philippians 1:6 NKJ ""Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:"" Regardless of how you may feel, no matter what your circumstances may be this morning! Your feelings aren't going to determine your destiny, your faith in the ""God of all possibilities is!"" TBS (the bible says) Im not moved by what I feel or see, I've got The Victor living in me! No matter what the circumstances may appear to be. Your best days are not behind you, with God, (if and that is the question) you have surrendered your all to Him. The word declares and it is a word worthy of taking to the bank! Your Greatest Days Are Not Behind You, Your Greatest Days Are Still Ahead of You! Until we see Jesus coming back to take His bride home, until we hear the trumpet sound! He is not going to quit paying attention to you and your circumstances! That's what makes serving God so exciting, because if you will let it, everyday will be more exciting than the one before! It's nothing that your going to do, but everything that God will do for you! We haven't even begun to reach the potential God has for each and everyone of us!"
James 5:16,"('Prayer', 'Victory', 'Confidence', 'Authority', 'Rest')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," How Gullible are we? Illus. By Richard Crow A missionary on furlough told this true story while visiting his home church in Michigan, ""While serving at a small field hospital in Africa, every two weeks I traveled by bicycle through the jungle to a nearby city for supplies. It was a journey of two days and required camping overnight at the halfway point. On one of these journeys, I arrived in the city where I planned to collect money from a bank, purchase medicine and supplies, and begin my two day journey back to the hospital. Upon arriving at the city, two men were fighting, and one was seriously injured. I treated his injuries and told him about Jesus Christ. I then traveled two days, camped overnight, and arrived back home without incident. Two weeks later I repeated my journey. When I arrived back at the city, I was approached by the young man I had treated. He told me he knew I carried money and medicines. He said ""Some friends and I followed you into the jungle, knowing you would camp overnight. We planned to kill you and take your money and drugs. But just as we were about to jump your camp, we saw that you were surrounded by 26 armed guards!"" At this I laughed and said that I certainly was all alone out in that jungle campsite. But the young man pressed the point, saying, ""No Sir, I was not the only person to see the guards. My five friends also saw them, and we all counted them. It was because of those 26 armed guards that we were afraid and left you alone."" At this point in his message, a man in the audience jumped to his feet and interrupted the missionary and asked the exact day that incident happened. The missionary told him - and the man excitedly told THIS story - ""On the night of your incident in Africa, it was morning here, and I was preparing to play golf. I was about to tee off when I felt the urge to pray for you. In fact, the urging of the Holy Spirit was SO STRONG, I called men to meet me here to pray for you. ""The man said, If you were here with me that day to pray please stand up?"" The men who met together to pray stood up. The missionary wasn't really concerned with who they were - but he wept as he counted their number -You guessed it - there were 26! James 5:16 NKJ 16 Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much. Righteous defined; acting in accord with divine or moral law : free from guilt or sin. How do we become free from guilt and sin? By accepting Jesus as our personal Savior and allowing ourselves, to be washed by the blood of the lamb that cleanses us from all unrighteousness! Who is righteous? Christians are the righteousness of God right? Who's righteousness is it? His righteousness, becomes our righteousness. How do we see our needs met and healings take place in our lives? By praying fervent prayers right? What is the definition of fervent? exhibiting or marked by great intensity of feeling : zealous or diligent prayers..."
John 1:1-5,"('The Word', 'Word Of God', 'The Word Of God', 'Word Was God')",Calvary Chapel," John 1.1-5 The Word 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. 4 In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it. Today we are going to begin a study of the Gospel of John. It was written around 85 to 90 AD. This is around 40 years after our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ returned to His rightful throne in Heaven. The city of Jerusalem now lies in ruins for close to 20 years after the Roman army leveled it. I find it interesting that the Temple complex that was initially expanded by Herod was finally finished just a few years earlier is now destroyed. There were three other reports that were previously written about the life of our Lord Jesus. The first one was penned by Matthew. He was an apostle who was selected by our Lord. Then we have the Gospel of Mark. If you read his Gospel you will see how he wrote himself into his testimony. He was the young boy who happened to be in the Garget of Gethsemane. The apostle Peter adopted him as his spiritual son and detailed to him his account of spending three and one half years with the Son of God. The next author was Luke. Luke was the man who accompanied Paul. He became for us a wonderful investigator. He took the time to sit down with the men and women who were disciples of The Lord Jesus. Most notably was his personal interview with our Lord Jesus' mom Mary, From Luke's Gospel we get the most information regarding the birth of the Lord Jesus. Then we have John's Gospel. He was one of the first individuals to follow Jesus in His ministry. His fellow companion was Andrew. I want to give you a term used a lot by religionist scholars and it is the term 'Synoptic'. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are referred to as the 'Synoptic Gospels' because they include many of the same stories yet each one provides some extra detail that help us fill in the picture of what took place. John's Gospel is 90% different the other three Gospels. Although four individuals penned the words and actions of our Lord Jesus over many years we find interesting enough a harmony between them. This is because our Precious Holy Spirit was behind their writings. We read in the second letter of Peter chapter 1 verse 21 this, 'for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit."" Before the earth was created and before time as we know it began, our Holy God created angels. One unique group that was created we find out from our Bibles were Cherubim. The angels had special assignments given to them by Almighty God. Some were assigned to accompany the Lord's chariot. Some as you know from the book of Genesis guarded the way to the tree of life. We also know one cherub was in charge of the worship in heaven. His name is Lucifer. Cherubim stand out from other angels in that our Holy Creator gave them 4 heads - Lion, Ox, Eagle, and that of a man."
Genesis 22:1-14,"('Provider', 'God Provides', 'Jehovah-Jireh')",Assembly Of God," JEHOVAH-JIREH Gen. 22:14 INTRODUCTION A. HUMOR: 1. There are times when even doing what is right seems like it will backfire on you. Old habits are hard to break. 2. One guy invariably left off the cap to the toothpaste and for years his wife had hounded him about it. Finally, on their 25th anniversary, he made a private commitment to break the annoying habit. 3. With faithfulness and regularity he screwed on the toothpaste cap every time he used it. After a week of unbroken success the poor guy was blindsided by his very suspicious wife. 4. She cornered him at the breakfast table and said, ""Why did you stop brushing your teeth?"" B. SERIES: THE COMPOUND NAMES OF GOD 1. We're on the Series of the ""Compound Names of God."" The first one we're going to look at is the name Jehovah-Jireh. 2. Naturally these names owe something of their significance to the name of Jehovah itself, which as we discussed last week, reveals God as the Eternal Self-Existent One, the God of Revelation, the God of moral and spiritual attributes - of righteousness, holiness, love, and therefore of redemption. 3. He's the God who stands in special covenant relationship to Israel, in contrast to Elohim, the general name of God in relation to all the nations. 4. Most of these compound names of God, arise out of some historic incident, and portray Jehovah in some aspect of His character as meeting human need. 5. Let's read the historical basis of the name Jehovah-Jireh. C. TEXT 22 Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, ""Abraham!"" ""Here I am,"" he replied. 2 Then God said, ""Take your son, your only son, whom you love--Isaac--and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you."" 3 Early the next morning Abraham got up and loaded his donkey. He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. When he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering, he set out for the place God had told him about. 4 On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance. 5 He said to his servants, ""Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then we will come back to you."" 6 Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together, 7 Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, ""Father?"" ""Yes, my son?"" Abraham replied. ""The fire and wood are here,"" Isaac said, ""but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?"" 8 Abraham answered, ""God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son."" And the two of them went on together. 9 When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. 10 Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. 11 But the angel of the Lord called out to him from heaven, ""Abraham! Abraham!"" ""Here I am,"" he replied. 12 ""Do not lay a hand on the boy,"" he said. ""Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son."" 13 Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram caught by its horns. He went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son. 14 So Abraham called that place 'The Lord Will Provide'[Jehovah-Jireh]. And to this day it is said, ""On the mountain of the Lord it will be provided."""
Philippians 4:8,"('Happiness', 'Joy', 'Satisfaction', 'Life And Peace')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Introduction: Everyone, believer or non-believer, wants to achieve happiness. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be happy as long as it is not our end all goal. Other than not having a relationship with Christ, the biggest thing that holds us back from accomplishing our dreams is, unfortunately, ourselves. We put limitations on ourselves every day, whether consciously or subconsciously. There are several practical things we can do to overcome these restraints. ""Life can either be something you embrace or something you hide from."" Stop making things more complicated than they actually are and just start living your life. It would be so much easier and more enjoyable if we would learn to just release certain unnecessary and unbiblical limitations. Let's look at some of the things you need to let go of on your journey to becoming a happier person. I am fully aware of the biblical difference between happiness and true joy, so please don't criticize this work before you begin reading it. My purpose is to simply offer basic instructions for better living. So, with that in mind, things you need to let go of are: 1. The Approval of Others When it really boils down to it, who cares what other people think? If you are happy with the decisions you have made, and you have sought God's will along the way, then whose business is that but you and God's? Imagine how much you could accomplish if you stopped letting other people's opinions dictate the way you live your life. You do you, don't let them do you. Pray, obey and study the Word, and from there take the actions you discover that might improve your life. Galatians 1:10, ""For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ"" (ESV). 2. Anger, Bitterness and Resentment Anger will eat away at you from the inside. Learn how to forgive those who may have wronged you. This isn't about dismissing the other persons harmful actions; it is about easing the pain that it caused inside of you. Remember that whoever you let anger you controls you. Forgiveness and letting go can actually lead you down the road of healing and peace. Colossians 3:13, ""Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you"" (NIV). 3. Negative Body Image This is a big one in the culture we find ourselves living in. Only one person's opinion should matter to you when it comes to your body and that is you. There is nobody out there who can determine what a ""correct"" body type is. If you are comfortable with yourself, and you are healthy, then that should be all that matters. Do not let others make you feel that you are less than beautiful because if you believe you are, then you are. Ephesians 2:10a, ""For we are his [God's] workmanship, created in Christ Jesus..."" (ESV). Genesis 1:27, ""So God created human beings in his own image. In the image of God he created them; male and female he created them"" (NLT)."
Romans 12:1,"('Worship', 'Mercy Of God')",Baptist," Worship is a Verb Romans 12:1 February 12, 2017 When I was in school, my favorite class was math. I loved math and wanted to major in math when I went to college. My most dreaded class was English. I couldn't write well and I didn't understand grammar. When Joshua and Zachary needed help in math, I was the chosen one to help them. Give me science, history, Spanish or math . . . but don't give me English. That was totally turned over to Debbie who can recite every preposition there is. She would explain grammar to the boys, I would look at her and shake my head. She would try to explain it to me, and I would just tell her to stop. I didn't understand grammar 40 years ago, and I'm not going to start today! Well, we have a grammar problem in the church. It's true for so many of us. We get a lot confused on this one. Here's a quick grammer lesson ~ Nouns are a part of speech that denotes a person, animal, place, thing, or idea. Verbs are words that show an action, occurrence, or state of being. So, what does this all have to do with us? Great question!! I believe when it comes to worship, most of us look at worship as a noun. It's a thing, it's a place, it's maybe even an idea. And for many of us, it's definitely not a verb. It's not an action oriented event. That may sound harsh, but I believe that is pretty true for the universal church. Starting last week, we were moving from talking about community and moving into talks about worship. Worship has been a hot topic in the church for the past 20-30 years. It used to be every church had a hymnal, sang out of that looking down at the hymnal. My first church was progressive, we had an overhead projector and a screen on the stage. Those were fun logistics to deal with, especially when the transperancy slid off the screen and you couldn't get the screen down quickly. Now, most churches have multi-media, we have screens and no hymnals and EVERYONE has their thoughts about worship . . . what it is and what it is not. This series is not about starting a worship war, it's actually to get us more on the same page, because worshiping God is the greatest thing we do. God's call to us is to worship Him in spirit and in truth. That's what Jesus said in John 4:23. My hope as we move through this series is that we will be able to come to a better agreement about what worship is and is not; different styles and ways to worship, and possibly to stretch each one of us a bit so we can expand the way we worship. I'm not advocating for us to become pentecostal in our worship or do to cartwheels and flips down the aisle. Worship should never be divisive. If it is, then satan is winning the war. Worship should always be unifying, because the focus is not you and me, it's the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Worship has to fit who you uniquely are according to God's creation. We all have some pretty strong feelings about what the right and proper way is to worship, and most likely, none of them are wrong, which makes this even more difficult. Yet, we're going to look at different aspects of worship during this series. Even to the point of dissecting our worship and ways we can be more effective at worship."
John 14:1-31,"('Holy Spirit', 'Home')",Assembly Of God," February 12, 2017 Morning Worship Text: John 14 Subject; The Holy Spirit Title: The Work of the Spirit Part 1 I want to begin a new series this morning - we kind of got started into last week - but this series will be on the work of the Holy Spirit. We will begin in John 14 and go through John 16 and when we are done I'm believing that your life will be changed and the life of this church. Not by the words that I speak, but by the Spirit of the living God living in you. Are you ready? Have you ever been dry? Do you ever get tired? Do you think that the life you are living isn't making a difference and that you just want to run and hide sometimes? I think we can all say we have experienced that spiritual dryness or that sense of ineffectiveness. There are times when I just get tired and I feel the need to just get away for a while and get my batteries recharged. So we take off to go somewhere, looking for something - we don't know what - that will fill up the space in us that we don't even know how it got emptied. This is personal - it is very difficult for us as pastors to go away and just empty ourselves of who we are and just relax. Because we are always wondering if everyone is OK and are there any problems - well, if you have never been a pastor you probably don't get this. And we go to places where we think we can find the peace and rest we are looking for but at the end of the week away the only thought on our minds is, ""Can't wait to get home..."" And then I think, ""Isn't that the whole problem in the first place? Isn't that the source of our weariness and our doubt and our anxiety? We are just working, ministering, living in a place that is temporary, and whether we know it or not, in our spirits, we are longing to be in the place where there won't be any weariness any longer."" We just long to be with Jesus. In just a few months school will be out and vacation mode will kick in and many of us will be doing just that same thing. Looking for spiritual rest by doing physical things. And he more I think about it, the more I realize that we as the church of Jesus Christ sometimes miss out on what He wants to do in us - the pure and simple relationship He wants to have in us - by not taking advantage of all the things that we have available to us. John 14:1-4 (NKJV) 1 ""Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me. 2 In My Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also. 4 And where I go you know, and the way you know."" I believe this is God's word... I believe it is for me... I accept it as mine... And I will appropriate it to my life today... There is so much in John 14-16 for us that I want to take a few weeks just to look at it all in some depth and try to connect the dots for you so you can receive everything the Lord wants you to have. Are you with me?"
Joel 2:28-32,"('Salvation', 'Last Days', 'Holy Spirit Baptism')",Assembly Of God," Already And Not Yet Text: Joel 2:28-32 Introduction 1. Tim Smith asks the question, ""What do these dates have in common (1248, 1306, 1689, 1792, 1836, 1844, 1914, 1936, 1960, 1974, 1981, 1988, 1989, 1992, 1994, 2011)? They all represent the times in which people predicted that the second coming of Christ would occur. No one, not even Jesus knows the exact time of Christ's coming. Matthew 24:36 What we do know is this: Christ's coming will be unexpected and dramatic. ""But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up."" 2 Peter 3:10."" 2. Several times in Joel we see the phrase ""the Day Of The Lord."" That phrase refers to the day of God's judgment on mankind. 3. When we talk about the Day of the Lord we need to keep in mind that prophecy has an already/not yet component to it. Some of the things concerning the last days have already happened and some of them are now happening. However, there are some things prophesied about the last days that are yet to come. 4. Our text today gives us some good examples of this already/not yet element... A. Already: Pouring Of The Spirit B. Already: Salvation To Anyone Who Asks C. Not Yet: Signs Of Judgment 5. Let's all stand as we read Joel 2:28-32. Proposition: The events leading up to Christ's return are happening before our very eyes, and we must be prepared for his coming. Transition: One of the things concerning the Day of The Lord that is already happened is... I. Already: Pouring Of The Spirit (28-29). A. I Will Pour Out My Spirit 1. As Pentecostals one of the things regarding the Last Days that has already occurred is the out pouring of the Holy Spirit. A. We believe the Holy Spirit comes and lives inside of us when we accept Jesus as our savior and we are transformed into new people. B. However, we also believe that there is something available to all believers called the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. C. This is something separate from and in addition to the Holy Spirit living inside of us when we believe. D. We also believe that the major emphasis of the baptism of the Holy Spirit is to empower us for ministry. E. Furthermore, we believe that the initial sign or proof of this baptism is speaking in tongues. 2. You might ask why this is so significant? It is significant because in OT times God was selective as to whom he filled with the Spirit. A. It was usually given to certain people like kings, prophets and priests. B. In addition it was usually given for a specific purpose. 3. However, Joel tells us, ""Then, after doing all those things, I will pour out my Spirit upon all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy. Your old men will dream dreams, and your young men will see visions. 29 In those days I will pour out my Spirit even on servants--men and women alike."" A. God promises to pour out his Spirit on ""all flesh,"" which refers to all humanity. B. This is clarified by the list of those on whom the Spirit will rest: sons, daughters, old men, young men, male servants and female servants."
Ephesians 1:15-19,"('Prayer', 'Petition')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Scripture We are currently in a series of sermons on Ephesians 1 that I am calling, ""God's Supreme Purpose."" In Ephesians 1:3-14, which is one, long, complex, glorious sentence in the original Greek, the Apostle Paul praised God for salvation. Paul praised the Father for planning our salvation, the Son for purchasing our salvation, and the Holy Spirit for applying that salvation to us. In Ephesians 1:15-23, which is also one, long, complex, glorious sentence in the original Greek, the Apostle Paul prayed for the saints to grow in their understanding of, and appreciation for, the blessings of salvation. Let's read Paul's prayer for the saints in Ephesians 1:15-19a: 15 For this reason, because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, 16 I do not cease to give thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers, 17 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him, 18 having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints, 19 and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe. (Ephesians 1:15-19a) Introduction Dr. James Montgomery Boice writes, If God is in charge of everything and has ""foreordained whatsoever comes to pass"" - in the words of the Westminster Shorter Catechism - what is the point of praying? In fact, what is the point of doing anything? Why witness? Why study the Bible? Why do good works? If what is going to happen is going to happen anyway, none of these things count. We might as well do as we please and let God do what he wants. The answer to these questions is that although God is sovereign and has indeed ""foreordained whatsoever comes to pass,"" he nevertheless uses means to accomplish his purposes. That is, God uses the means of Scripture reading, prayer, witnessing, serving, and so on to accomplish his purposes. The astonishing thing is that God uses fallen human beings to accomplish his purposes! This truth is taught most clearly in Ephesians 1. The Apostle Paul clearly taught the sovereignty of God in our salvation in the first half of the chapter. He could not have been clearer about God the Father planning our salvation by electing a vast number to salvation, the Son purchasing our salvation by his life, death, burial, and resurrection, and the Holy Spirit applying the blessings of salvation to the elect. In the second half of the chapter the Apostle Paul stressed the importance of prayer so that believers would fully understand and appreciate the blessings of salvation. Lesson Paul's prayer for the saints in Ephesians 1:15-19 shows us how to praise and petition God for believers. Let's use the following outline: 1. Praise God for Believers (1:15-16) 2. Petition God for Believers (1:17-19a) I. Praise God for Believers (1:15-16) First, Paul's prayer for the saints shows us how to praise God for believers."
Mark 9:30-41,"('Humility', 'Pride', 'Status', 'Serving')",Baptist," Measuring Up Mark 9:30-41 Rev. Brian Bill February 11-12, 2017 Almost every time we visit my parents my mom gives me some yellowed files or beat up toys that I had when I was growing up. Several years ago I came across some old report cards. I knew I didn't have the best grades but I had forgotten how bad they really were. My lowest grades in Junior High were in Band and Spanish - I haven't made much improvement in language or the arts over the years. In High School it was Spanish and Zoology that caused me much distress. You might get a kick out of one of my report cards from college. In one semester, my lowest grade was in Public Speaking! Some of you are not surprised by this one. Since my Spanish in High School was ""muy malo,"" I decided to take Italian in college. That was a huge mistake. I realized I was in trouble when the professor told us after the first day of class he would not speak any more English. Everything would be in Italian from that point on. I languished with this language, getting a ""D"" for the semester. The next semester I had a TA (Teaching Assistant) who wouldn't speak English either (what's up with that?). But then something very exciting happened. The TA's went on strike! That meant I didn't have to go to class. We were supposed to keep up with our work but I didn't crack a book for weeks. When the strike was over, I went back to class and ended up with an ""Incomplete"" for a grade. The next semester I actually got an ""F."" I felt like a failure, and wanted to bail on college. I hung in there, eventually getting saved and then after four years at the University of Wisconsin, transferred to Moody Bible Institute, where my grades were much better (that's probably because they didn't offer Italian). Those feelings of failure, however, stayed with me for a long time, and came back to the surface when we were missionaries in Mexico, and I couldn't learn Spanish. Have you ever felt like a failure and just wanted to quit? Does it feel like you're just taking the same class over and over, wondering if you'll ever pass the course? We left the discouraged disciples last week in a house where Jesus told them that they were powerless in the valleys of life because they were prayerless. Jesus huddles up with the disciples many times to impart truth, like a teacher with his students. They call him ""Teacher"" but they're having a real difficult time learning the truths that He wants them to grasp. They would be embarrassed to show us their report cards. The disciples had to repeat some classes because they just couldn't get it. We're in Mark 9 again this weekend. We're going to first review a couple verses in chapter 8 and then bounce over to chapter 10. In each of these passages the Teacher teaches a lesson and his students totally bomb the class. "" Class #1: Let's go back to Mark 8:31-32: ""And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again. And he said this plainly."" Do you see the word ""teach"" here? He very clearly taught them that He would suffer, be rejected, be killed and rise again."
Ephesians 1:1-2,"('Ephesus', 'Grace And Peace', 'By The Will Of God', ""God's Holy People"")",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 11/7/16 Lesson 1: Dear Ephesians (1:1-2) Series: Paul's Letter to the Ephesians Ephesians 1:1-2 (NIV) 1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To God's holy people in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus: 2 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Ephesians 1:1-2 (ESV) To the saints who are in Ephesus, and are faithful in Christ Jesus: 2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Introduction The first two verses of Ephesians make up the salutation. This type of salutation was the usual way of starting a letter in Paul's day. The custom was to give first the name of the writer, then to identify the reader or readers and finally to express greetings. Paul in his letters followed this pattern. However, he always gave it a decidedly Christian flavor and varied and amplified it according to circumstances. Evidently, the Ephesians letter was originally circulated as an epistle intended for all the churches of the Roman province of Asia (of which Ephesus was the capital city). The church at Ephesus likely received this letter first, and later was entrusted with its safe keeping. Thus the letter eventually became identified exclusively with Ephesus. Commentary 1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To God's holy people in Ephesus[1], the faithful in Christ Jesus: ""Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus."" Ancient correspondence--like its contemporary counterparts--opened according to a traditional formula. Our practice is to write the recipient's name at the beginning and the author's signature at the end. Modern e-mails have reverted to the more sensible ancient form in which the names of both the writer and the recipient were given first, usually followed by some words of greeting. Paul (his name means ""small"") adopted this basic formula in almost all of his letters. Only in his strongly worded letter to the Galatians did he refrain from all expressions of thankfulness to God for his blessings on the recipients. Paul identifies himself as the author, describes his readers, and sends his greetings (v 2). The opening words-- Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus--reveal both the name (Paul) and the status (apostle) of the author. Paul states that he is ""an apostle."" What is an apostle? It is the highest office that the church has ever had. No one today is an apostle in the church for the simple reason that they cannot meet the requirements of an apostle. Here are the requirements: 1) The apostles received their commission directly from the living lips of Jesus. Paul made that claim for himself. He wrote, ""Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead)"" (Galatians 1:1). This is the reason I believe Paul took the place of Judas. The disciples had selected Matthias, but I don't find anywhere that Jesus Christ made him an apostle. Apparently all the apostles received their commission directly from the Lord Jesus."
Matthew 7:15-23,"('Fruit', 'Fruits', 'False Prophet')",United Methodist," Is your preacher true or false? Is your family? Are you? See it is very simple, true = good, false = bad! There are bad people in the world and their sole purpose is to destroy you! Read Matthew 7: 15-23 Jesus has just got through warning us about the path to destruction in the Sermon on the Mount, and now he is warning us how many people are trying to guide us down that wide destructive path. We have to combat these people at all costs and the best way to do that is to beware of them. Just like wolves hunt sheep, they hunt you! They disguise themselves as harmless, but are truly destructive. So how do we combat these false teachers? You will know them by the life they live! Do they exhibit: 1. Faith, humility, and righteousness 2. Is the content of their teaching from God or from man? 3. What is the effect of their actions? Does it inspire or destroy? See we have to understand that our fruit is the result of who we are, now it may take time to harvest that fruit but it will eventually show whether it is good or bad fruit. Our fruit will reveal what kind of tree we are, remember you can't get good fruit from a dead tree! If your fruit is bad, then your tree is bad. If your fruit is good so is your tree. That is how it works, it doesn't work any other way. What do you do with a bad tree? You cut it down and burn it. It is not enough to destroy just the fruit, you must destroy the source from whence it came. That is what God does, if we do not follow Him and produce good fruit, He will cut you down and cast you into the fire! IT IS THAT SIMPLE! If you pay close attention you will know a person by the good or evil they produce, We must understand that acting like a Christian but not living it will not save you! Sunday Christians will not get it done, your faith must be shown in each and every day of your life. I once heard it said: ""there are those that speak like angels, live like devils; have Jacob's smooth tongue, but Esau's rough hands."" All the impressive spiritual accomplishments mean nothing without true fellowship with Christ. The acts you do prove nothing if they are not for Christ, He must truly live in your heart. If preaching could save a man, Judas would not have been damned. In the end there is only one basic thing for you need for salvation, to repent and know Jesus as your Lord and Savior! The gift He gives us is free, but if you choose not to accept it, He says ""Depart from Me"". What does that mean? It means leave me alone, your were never saved. Can you imagine how terrible that would be, to be doomed to an eternity in Hell. There are people at every turn trying to trick and deceive you, it is important that you detect them. Satan is at every turn trying to get you to deny God, you must know God, know your bible and live the way you are supposed to. Get yo Heaven, don't burn in Hell!"
Genesis 9:1-13,"('Peace', 'Citizenship', 'Justice', 'Be Fruitful')",Catholic," Thursday of Sixth Week in Course Joy of the Gospel We are now in the season which the Extraordinary Form calendar still calls Septuagesima, or the seventy days before Easter. In other words, we need to remember that we are looking toward the beginning of Lent on March 1, and the sacrifices we need to make to improve our imaging of Jesus and Mary. Genesis today helps us by speaking of a new beginning of the covenant between God and humans. The command given to Adam and Eve is given to Noah and his family: ""Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth."" After the war that God visited upon the faithless and unjust evil society that sin had left, we see peace return in the form of a sign-the rainbow. The Holy Father now writes about the common good, and the striving for peace in society: 'We have spoken at length about joy and love, but the word of God also speaks about the fruit of peace (cf. Gal 5:22). 'Peace in society cannot be understood as pacification or the mere absence of violence resulting from the domination of one part of society over others. Nor does true peace act as a pretext for justifying a social structure which silences or appeases the poor, so that the more affluent can placidly support their lifestyle while others have to make do as they can. Demands involving the distribution of wealth, concern for the poor and human rights cannot be suppressed under the guise of creating a consensus on paper or a transient peace for a contented minority. The dignity of the human person and the common good rank higher than the comfort of those who refuse to renounce their privileges. When these values are threatened, a prophetic voice must be raised. 'Nor is peace ""simply the absence of warfare, based on a precarious balance of power; it is fashioned by efforts directed day after day towards the establishment of the ordered universe willed by God, with a more perfect justice among men"". In the end, a peace which is not the result of integral development will be doomed; it will always spawn new conflicts and various forms of violence. 'People in every nation enhance the social dimension of their lives by acting as committed and responsible citizens, not as a mob swayed by the powers that be. Let us not forget that ""responsible citizenship is a virtue, and participation in political life is a moral obligation"".[180] Yet becoming a people demands something more. It is an ongoing process in which every new generation must take part: a slow and arduous effort calling for a desire for integration and a willingness to achieve this through the growth of a peaceful and multifaceted culture of encounter. 'Progress in building a people in peace, justice and fraternity depends on four principles related to constant tensions present in every social reality. These derive from the pillars of the Church's social doctrine, which serve as ""primary and fundamental parameters of reference for interpreting and evaluating social phenomena"".In their light I would now like to set forth these four specific principles which can guide the development of life in society and the building of a people where differences are harmonized within a shared pursuit. I do so out of the conviction that their application can be a genuine path to peace within each nation and in the entire world.'"
2 Timothy 1:6,"('Fellowship', 'Prayer', 'Bible Study', 'Spirituality')",Christian/Church Of Christ," ""Untended fires soon become just a pile of ashes."" I came across this quotation some time ago and it always resurfaces in my memory when we go camping and make a campfire. The last time we went camping was in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. We built a nice warm fire in the cool of the evening and roasted marshmallows. After awhile, the fire began to grow smaller, and smaller, until there were nothing but glowing embers. Sometimes I would take a stick, poke around in the fire a little, and there would be a flame again. It wasn't until we put fresh firewood and stirred up the embers that we had a nice warm fire again. Paul told Timothy, ""I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God which is in you."" (2 Tim 1:6). Sometimes we need to be revitalized. When we dwindle down to glowing embers, it's time to do something. If not, the smoldering embers will soon go out. I would like to spend a moment reflecting on the imagery that Paul uses here in 2 Timothy and take it a step further. Flame and Fellowship. I still remember the campfires from Bible Camp and how a piece of burning wood might fall over to one side by itself. It usually burned for a little while, but would eventually go out long, long before the main fire went out. That reminds me of this passage in Hebrews: ""consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another"" (Heb 10:24-25). There is a reason Jesus purchased the church with his blood (Acts 20:28). There is a reason the church is called a ""body"" (1 Cor 12:12-27). There is a reason we are called ""brothers"" and ""sisters"" (1 Tim 5:1-2). If we leave the collection of burning logs, we will quickly grow cold and our flame could go out. Intimate support and fellowship with the brethren is important. Do you feel burned out? Maybe it is because you have strayed away from the campfire, or you keep it at arms distance. Consider the words of an inspired wise man: ""Two are better than one because them have a good return for their labor. For if either of them fails, the one will lift up his companion. But woe to the one who falls when there is not another to lift him up. Furthermore, if two lie down together, they keep warm, but how can one be warm alone? And if one can overpower him who is alone, two can resist him. A cord of three strands is not quickly torn apart (Eccl. 4:9-12)."" Flame and Food. You must have a fire if you are going to cook your food. Uncooked food can cause disease and even death. So we must stir up a flaming passion for nourishment. Jesus said, ""I am the bread of life. This is the bread which came down out of heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die, if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever; and the bread also which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh. It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life (John 6:48-63)."" The words of Jesus are the bread of life that sustains us spiritually forever. Do you have trouble remembering to pray? Is it hard just to force yourself to go to worship at the church building? Do you feel burned out, faint, and weak? Maybe you have not been eating properly. Do you have a regular diet of the bread of life, the word of God? If you only eat once a week on Sunday (and that is often not even a full meal), is it any wonder you lack spiritual energy and vitality? Is it any wonder you feel like a spiritual anorexic?"
John 5:39,"('Bible', 'Jesus', 'Creed', 'Creedal Statement')",Christian/Church Of Christ," Studying the history of creeds is interesting. The earliest creeds arose in reaction to heretics who were teaching heresy concerning the nature of God and Christ. They served to unite the church in sound doctrine against false teaching. When the church and government became fused, resulting in the paganization of the church and the christianization of society, many abuses, aberrant practices, and erroneous teachings flooded into the church. Worldly values such as power and authority overshadowed biblical ones such as humility and meekness and deeply affected the leadership of the church in a negative way. With the Reformation came an explosion of reform movements all over the world. In order to unite and define their distinct belief and practice, these movements formulated creeds. These dizzying array of creeds tended to divide and fracture these movements into various sects, all claiming to be true Christianity. On the American frontier, there were two ""Great Awakenings."" During this time there was an emphasis among many people on going back to the Bible alone. One of the mottos from this time period was, ""No creed but the Bible."" Many leaders believed that if we discarded denominational names and creeds, we all could unite upon the simplicity of the Gospel as presented in the Bible. We would all be simply, ""Christians,"" nothing more. This was a vast improvement on former movements that tended to formulate creeds that tended only to bring more division and more Christian sects. Effort of many of these pioneers were designed to move away from sectarian Christianity on the basis of the Bible alone as the basis for unity. Churches of Christ and Christian Churches are descendants of this back-to-the-Bible movement. Historians have often said that one of the greatest strengths of this movement was its emphasis on biblical teaching and authority. The article in Mead's Handbook of Denominations in the United States says that it is remarkable that Churches of Christ, without any centralized government, headquarters, or creed, have the level of uniformity that they do in regards to doctrine and practice. There was for the most part a large degree of unity among Churches of Christ based in large part on biblical teaching without an official creed. However, some in their zeal to return to the Bible may have missed the big picture and have neglected the weightier matters of scripture. There is an emphasis on the Bible, but not a greater emphasis on what is more central in the Christian faith. This seems to be to sort of thing that many scribes, doctors of the law, Pharisees, and Jews had done. Jesus said, ""You search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about me"" (Jn 5:39). Faith in God wasn't primarily about counting out each grain of wheat or spice to make sure it equals exactly 10%, or about not lifting a finger to do anything that remotely looks like work on the Sabbath, or about making sure you were thoroughly ritually washed. These were not bad things in themselves. However, these in themselves did not endear the people to God. The reason they did not is that these folks had neglected the weightier matters, such as justice, mercy, and love. They knew their scriptures, but didn't know God. To them, God was reduced to a set of rules. They often elevated the wrong rules. There seems to have been a religious debate on which commandments were the greater commandments. This is probably why Jesus was asked which is the greatest commandment. The rules that these Pharisees, Jews, lawyers, and scribe elevated indicate what God was like to them. To them, God was not relational, but a rule giver and a accountant of who keeps all the rules."
1 Timothy 2:16-3:17,"('Bible', 'Scripture', 'Authority Of Scripture')",Christian/Church Of Christ," In a conversation, someone posed an interesting and much needed question to me. ""Is it wise to think outside of the box?"" There are many, including myself, who have used this phrase. Wisdom would seem to dictate that this, like many other things, should have a caveat to it. Many things pressed to the extreme can be self-defeating and have just the opposite effect we desire. As I reflect on this question, I am not thinking of things such as science, medicine, and technology. We all can readily see the great progress and improvements we have had in these areas due to ""outside the box"" thinking. Of course, there are some serious caveats, such as the issues associated with cloning, abortion, and other things that ""outside the box"" thinking has brought. There still has to be some sort of limitation when you go outside the box, especially in the area of ethics. But this is not what I am thinking about. I am thinking about our faith in God as we live it out in our daily life. Is it wise to ""think outside the box"" as it relates to my faith? As I reflect on this, I need to back up and ask myself the question, ""What does this phrase mean?"" The idea of a ""box"" suggests limitation. Limitation is not inherently a bad thing. God placed bounds on the sea so that it would not inundate the dry land. This is a limitation that is a blessing to us land-lovers. God also set a boundary between night and day. Without this limitation, our world would either freeze to death or burn up. God gave the Torah to his people, which also had limitations. It would be similar to putting a fence around the yard to keep the children from wandering out into traffic. Keeping the Torah was a limitation that God gave for the good of his people. God has limited even our life span. In the beginning, it appears that humans lived nearly a thousand years. During that time, the world became very wicked, and God was grieved about what had happened to man. Imagine the amount of knowledge, wisdom, and technical expertise you could amass if you could live that long! Since sin had corrupted mankind, imagine the amount of godless pride you could also amass as well! God decided to limit man's years. Though the text does not say whether this was a punishment or gift, this limitation can be seen as a blessing by limiting the amount of pride we could amass in a lifetime. So, a box is not inherently a bad thing. On the other had, a box is not inherently a good thing either. If the box means falling short of God's will, it is actually a bad thing. Those who think outside of the box cast off whatever falls short of God's will. Some examples include people like Hezekiah who did not accept the status quo and enacted reforms in order to be more faithful to Yahweh. He broke down the high places, which had been around for so long, the people accepted them as a part of life. He also destroyed the bronze serpent that God had instructed Moses to build because Israel began to venerate it and burn incense to it. Then there was Josiah, who also enacted reforms that not only included destroying the high places, but also destroyed the first shrine that Jereboam ben Nebat had built at the beginning of his reign 300 years earlier. He even went so far as disinterring the graves associated with the high places and burning the bones on their altars in order to defile them. This was definitely ""outside of the box."" For the Jews, especially the Pharisees, Jesus himself was way outside of the box. His actions on the Sabbath, his revolutionary teachings about the nature of greatness, mercy, and justice were all outside of the box. The inclusion of the Gentiles into the Kingdom was way outside the box for many Jews, including Peter the Apostle. He had a lot of trouble with accepting this to be the new norm. Throughout history, there have been others who have went outside the box, such as John Wycliff, William Tyndale, Martin Luther, Menno Simons, John Wesley, Alexander Campbell and Pardee Butler. Going outside of the box resulted in death threats for people like these. One translated the Bible into a language all people would be able to read and not just those with advanced degrees and training. Another was very innovative and used the printing press to distribute scriptures to the common man. One was a professor of theology that dared to question the doctrines, practices, and beliefs of the church. Another taught that as God's people, we are not of the world; therefore there is no such thing as a ""state church."" God's people are citizens of Heaven. One decided to preach the Gospel outside in the open air to the lowliest classes of people who did not attend a Cathedral, and then enrolled them in classes dealing with holy living after their conversion. Before this, preaching was confined to the cathedral to those acceptable classes of people who attended. Another taught that we should discard all creeds because they tend to be divisive, and that our only authority should be the word of God, and that all who claim to be Christians should unite rather than divide into various sects. Then there were those who made moves to abolish slavery, speaking out against those brethren who waffled on the issue and those who supported slavery. Many brethren not only accepted, but actively promoted slavery. For many Americans, including Christians, the rejecting of slavery was most definitely outside of the box. These ideas were revolutionary. They were outside the box. So, a box is not inherently a good thing either."
Ephesians 5:21-32,"('Love', 'Marriage', ""Valentine's Day"", 'Love  Of God')",Christian/Church Of Christ," You probably are acutely aware of all the pink and red decorating many of our stores in the month of February. I have been thinking a lot about what it represents, and what we can learn. It occurred to me that many of us preachers will preach timely messages on Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Easter, and even Christmas. Yet, when it come to Valentine's Day, we usually pass that one over. I had to ask myself the question, ""why?"" I can't speak for others, but I think the answer for myself is that this seems too worldly to merit preaching a message related to it. But is God completely silent on the themes this day brings to us? You can't avoid it. The commercials, the decorations in the stores, the parties in school, the gifts at the office, and many other things confront us whether we like it or not. We are talking about romantic love. Why do we Christians avoid that topic so much at church and in religious settings? Is it completely worldly? Is it ungodly? Does the Bible condemn it? Maybe the Bible ignores it? I think what we will find it that it is far from worldly. In fact, it is a reflection of our God. God is love. When I say love, I am not talking about the little miniature fat guy that goes around shooting people with arrows. That is almost too cute for my taste. In fact, it can make romantic love seem almost silly or frivolous. What I am talking about is the special love a man and a woman have for each other. The love a man and woman have for each other is part of God's design from the very beginning when he saw that it was not good for man to be alone. If you have never read the Song of Solomon, which is really titled the ""Song of Songs"" in the first chapter, which means ""The Best of Songs,"" then you are missing out on the best love poetry ever written. The whole book is a love poem between a betrothed couple, who later appear to have gotten married. It is romantic, sensual and is part of the word of God. The couple refers to each other as the ""one whom my soul loves."" It speaks of being faint with love. It describes the admiration for and the delight they have in each other. In poetically describes the precious beauty that they see in each other. Some people have had a real problem with taking this book literally, as if romantic love poetry is not worthy of scripture. As a result, they interpret it as an allegory of God's love for his bride Israel or as an allegory of Christ's love for the church. But that doesn't eliminate the fact that it is still romantic love poetry. If it were merely figurative of God's love for us, the conclusion is still the same. Romantic love is not worldly but comes from God. In fact, if it were figurative, then the case is even stronger that romantic love is godly, good, and beautiful. It is a reflection of the love that God has for us. Imagine that! God describing is love for his people in romantic love poetry! However, I think we should take it as what it is. It is simply beautiful and romantic love poetry."
2 Corinthians 13:3-4,"('Wisdom', 'Weakness', 'Strength In Christ', 'Wisdom From God')",Christian/Church Of Christ," Paul spends time defending his ministry. Evidently there were eminent ""super-apostles (2 Cor 12:11), who were sharp in every way. Paul was unimpressive and even contemptible in comparison. These other leaders apparently had letters of commendation (2 Cor 3) which was impressive, they apparently boasted in their success, knowledge, and accomplishments (2 Cor 10-12), they apparently were skilled (2 Cor 11:6), unlike Paul, they were paid by the people they taught (2 Cor 11:7), which is what any eminent teacher/philosopher/etc. would do. Paul could have easily used many of these same methods but chose not to (2 Cor 2). He intentionally ""de-exalted"" himself. Apparently his trainees did the same(2 Cor 12:18). There is a theme of spiritual warfare that seems to run through much of what he says, but it is a war that runs upside-down and backwards to conventional thought about ministry, strength, power, and success. 2 Cor 1:5 - ""For just as the sufferings of Christ are ours in abundance, so also our comfort is abundant through Christ."" 2 Cor 1:12b - ""...not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we have conducted ourselves in the world, especially toward you."" Paul rejected conventional wisdom and chose to operate in the grace of God instead. He recognized that God's grace is sufficient. He does not need anything else, and anything else may actually be detrimental. 2 Cor 3:fb - ""...but our adequacy is from God."" 2 Cor 3:18 - ""But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory (or, with ever increasing glory""), just as from the Lord, the Spirit. The goal of his ministry was not amassing a large following like some of the ""super-apostles"" of the day. The goal came from his Lord - it was lives that are being transformed into the image of Christ. In other words, people lived like, thought like, and had the attitude of Christ. It was never about the greatness of the vessel, but the greatness of God. 2 Cor 3:7 - ""We have this treasure in earthen vessels, so that the surpassing greatness of the power will be of God and not from ourselves;"" 2 Cor 4:18 - ""...we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen..."" 2 Cor 5:7 - ""...we walk by faith, not by sight..."" Paul and his disciples had 20/20 spiritual vision. They could see, perceive, and understand the world around them. They also understood their own inadequacy, weakness, and brokenness. This is why Paul was able to correctly say ""I am a nobody (2 Cor 12:11). 2 Cor 5:16 - ""...from now on we recognize no one according to the flesh; even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know (Him - this word supplied by the translators and not in the original text) in this way no longer..."" Paul does not look at anyone or anything from a fleshly point of view. He operates out of a different paradigm that is not of this world, which redefines greatness, success, and wisdom. 2 Cor 10:1-4 - ""Now I, Paul, myself urge you by the meekness of gentleness of Christ - I who am meek when face to face with you, but bold toward you when absent! I ask that when I am present I need not be bold with the confidence with which I propose to be courageous against some, who regard us as if we walked according to the flesh. For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh, for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses."""

Acts 17:22-31,"('Resurrection', 'Creator', 'Judgment', 'Sustainer')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," AN ANSWER TO AGNOSTICISM Acts 17:22-31 While Paul was waiting for Silas and Timothy to catch up with him in Athens, he might have been excused if he took some leisure to do a little sightseeing. However, seeing a city full of idols provoked Paul into a painful state of agitation: quite literally a 'paroxysm' (Acts 17:16). The Apostle was experiencing the same reaction to idolatry as does the LORD Himself (e.g. Isaiah 65:2-3)! So, Paul reasoned with the worshippers in the synagogue, and disputed every day with the passers-by in the market place (Acts 17:17). This led to the opportunity to share the gospel 'in the midst of' the philosophical council on Mars hill (Acts 17:22). Despite having been 'taken hold of' and 'brought' to Mars hill (Acts 17:19), Paul was not under arrest: the council no longer functioned as a court, and at the end of the proceedings Paul was free to 'depart' from the midst of them (Acts 17:33). Although Paul had been so agitated at the idolatry which he saw, he was composed in his thoughts as he addressed the assembly in the passage before us. The Apostle first politely suggested that they were ""far too religious"" (Acts 17:22). It is possible to be too 'religious' without really making any real headway toward the divine (cf. Acts 17:27)! Paul found a point of contact with his listeners: among the many shrines which he had observed, he had noticed an altar dedicated to ""the unknown God"" (Acts 17:23). It was this God, ""whom not knowing you reverence,"" he suggested, ""who I proclaim to you"" (Acts 17:23). The Apostle was not thereby endorsing their religiosity, but rather acknowledging their ignorance (cf. Acts 17:30). The address thereafter speaks of God as the Creator and Sustainer of all things (Acts 17:24-25). From one man (Adam!) He made every nation of men and, significantly, determined the times and the boundaries of their dwellings (Acts 17:26). Paul quoted Greek poets (Acts 17:28), just like we might quote Shakespeare to an English-speaking audience. There is a sense in which God is the father of all mankind. We find it in the genealogy of Luke's Gospel, where Adam is called 'the son of God' (Luke 3:38). Paul's argument is, since we are the ""offspring"" of God, we ought not think that the God who made us can be likened to gold, or silver, or stone - or anything of our devising (Acts 17:29). With this, Paul announces that the God of whom he speaks - the God whom they are groping after in a cloud of ignorance - is the judge of all the earth. Furthermore, there is a specific day set for this righteous judgment, and a man appointed for the task. Of this same man (Jesus - cf. Acts 10:42), God has given assurance by raising Him from the dead (Acts 17:31)! Some chose, and still choose, to scoff at the resurrection. Others chose to prevaricate (Acts 17:32). Others 'believed' (Acts 17:34) - in what Paul proclaimed: 'Jesus and the resurrection' (cf. Acts 17:18). God is commanding all men everywhere to repent. The times of this ignorance cannot go on (Acts 17:30). Time is running out..."
Ezra 9:5-9,"('Prayer', 'Intercession', 'Revival', 'Repentance')",Independent/Bible," Carolyn Berry wore opera-length pearls when she took the high road, posing for the cover of People magazine in 2001 with her arm around husband Gary Condit, then a U.S. Congressman and suspect in the death of Chandra Levy, a Washington intern with whom he'd had an affair. Silda Wall Spitzer, former First Lady of New York State, also wore pearls when she played The Good Wife to Eliot Spitzer's Bad Governor who, in 2008, was embroiled in a prostitution scandal. Gloria Cain, wife of Herman Cain, whose 2012 presidential campaign unravelled due to accusations of sexual harassment, took to television to vouch for her man wearing very few accessories. Melania Trump also chose minimalism for her televised testimonial in the wake of the 2016 release of Donald Trump's infamous Access Hollywood outtake and the sexual assault allegations that followed. Renata Ford made a rare public appearance wearing sombre tones in 2013 during one of Rob Ford's numerous troubles. Like Huma Abedin before her -- wife of former New York Congressman Anthony Weiner, whose serial sexting troubles started in 2011 -- she appeared head-bowed, hands clasped in repose. This sad sorority welcomed a new member this week: Janneke Van Berge Henegouwen, wife of Montreal MNA Gerry Sklavounos, who stood stoic on Thursday as her husband announced his intention to return to his seat in the National Assembly. (http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/michelle-hauser-another-stoic-woman-joins-the-good-wives-club-in-face-of-husbands-political-scandal) In our day, when many feel little responsibility even for their own sins, it strikes us as strange that anyone would feel such personal guilt and pain over the sins of others. A more common reaction might be a feeling of smug satisfaction, like that of the Pharisee who thanked God that he was not as sinful as the tax collector (Luke 18:9-14). Political leaders today seldom feel compelled to resign because of the misdeeds of their subordinates as they once did. They might be more inclined to put the blame for their own misdeeds on their subordinates and sacrifice the subordinates to save themselves (Brug, J. F. (1985). Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther (p. 52). Milwaukee, WI: Northwestern Pub. House.). The most remarkable feature of Ezra's confession in Ezra 9 is the thoroughness with which he identifies himself with his erring countrymen, is ashamed of their transgressions, and for their misconduct. All their sins he appears to consider as his sins, all their disobedience as his disobedience, all their perils as his perils. Another striking feature in his sense of the exceeding sinfulness of the particular sin of the time (see vers. 6, 7, 10). He views it as a ""great trespass""--one that ""is grown up into the heavens""--which is equivalent to a complete forsaking of God's commandments, and on account of which he and his people ""cannot stand before"" God. This feeling seems based partly on the nature of the sin itself (ver. 14), but also, and in an especial way, on a strong sense of the ingratitude shown by the people in turning from God so soon after God had forgiven their former sins against him, and allowed them to return from the captivity, rebuild the temple, and re-establish themselves as a nation. If after their deliverance they again fell away, the sin could not but be unpardonable; and the punishment to be expected was a final uprooting and destruction from which there could be no recovery (vers. 13, 14)."
Psalms 51:1-4,"('Repentance', 'Motivation', 'Holiness', 'Sin Against God')",Baptist," REPENTANCE SERIES Online Sermon: http://www.mckeesfamily.com/?page_id=3567 We started off this series by talking sin and the character of God. When we sin, we become distant from God because He is pure light and there is no darkness in Him at all. We learned that repentance is the mechanism that God has given us to be forgiven and have our relationship restored with Him. Since we are ambassadors and royal priests who have the gift of the Holy Spirit, then why are we not able to continually repent and thus maintain our close relationship with God? To begin to answer this question, last week we explored seven myths concerning repentance. It is a myth that motivations such as sorrow, preservation, penance, reformation, self-deception, selective and no consequence; lead to repentance. This week's sermon will explain ten of the most common impediments to repentance and then finish off by describing seven key motivating factors of a truly repentant heart. . PART 3: MOTIVATION TO REPENT IMPEDIMENTS TO REPENTANCE Psalm 51:1-4 Before I describe seven Godly motivators that lead to repentance I first want to describe some of the reasons as to why we do not repent. In his book The Doctrine of Repentance, Thomas Watson lists ten impediments of repentance. 1. Blessings = no Need to Repent 17 You say, 'I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.' But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked. Revelation 3:19, NIV When Christians are blessed they often foolishly assume that there must be no sin in their lives and therefore no need to repent. For example, Jesus told the church of Laodicea that their blessings did not excuse the fact that they were wretched, poor, blind and naked and in need of repentance. Like the people of Laodicea, when we are lukewarm in our attitude towards sin, God will spit us out of His mouth (3:16). 2. Repentance is Easy Many Christians believe repentance is easy, just bow your head and give God a quick prayer of confession. Repenting and having sin removed from one's life is far from easy! When sins become habits, they tend to become part of our character. These strongholds of sin are not easily torn down! 3. God's Mercy = no Need to Repent 16 But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in Him and receive eternal life. 1 Timothy 1:16, NIV Even though Paul was the ""chief of all sinners,"" God chose to show him mercy. Likewise, God often shows us mercy as well but that does not mean that we are to roll like pigs in the muck of our sin! Do not forget, God also knows how to discipline those He loves (Hebrews 12:6)! 4. Too Lazy to Change Often Christians do not repent because they are lazy. While it is only through the power of the Holy Spirit that one can truly repent and change, God still wants us to put daily effort into having our minds transformed (Romans 12:2). 5. Sin is Pleasurable James says that we are tempted by the evil desires in our hearts (1:14). ""The sinner thinks there is danger in sin, but there is delight, and danger doth not so terrify him, as the delight bewitcheth him."" How can one repent when one does not grieve but rejoice in one's sin?"
Hebrews 10:38,"('Prayer', 'Acting Upon Faith', 'Continue In Prayer', 'A Hand Of Power', 'Peace And Victory')",*other," ""Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him."" (Hebrews 10:38). Faith in the kingdom is a lifestyle thing. It is not something we do to have a breakthrough and then relapse back into defeat. No! We were born into victory in Christ. It is a life of the spirit filled with glory and power, but we live in a physical world where the human senses is constantly at war with the things of the Spirit. A young fella once asked me ""Mr Preacher? Do you ever get tempted with sin?"" My reply was ""Jesus was tempted in the wilderness at a very crucial point in his life and that was the beginning of his earthly ministry and what difference does it make to me. The problem is not the temptation we face but our response to God's Word"". The enemy's target is not you but the Word at work in you. He careless if you were here or there but when there is something different about you. He begins to roam about trying figure out things that cant be found in the sense realm. He came to Jesus with the best he got, an onslaught on the sense realm. ""And when the tempter came to him, he said, If you are the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread."" (Matthew 4:3). Two things are clearly stated from that scripture: (1) An attack on His Identity: ""If you are the son of God"" Now that's not a question but a reaffirmation of what he already knows, otherwise he won't be using a conditional clause ""if"" without a background of whom he was. Therefore he was deliberate with an intent to get Jesus out of the Word into the sense realm. No wonder the next words he used were ""Turn these stones to bread"" an impossible task in the sense realm to keep Christ in a dilemma ""wondering if he was truly the son of God and if so, why not show a proof of self gratification instead of the mission at hand."" Now that was a complete spiritual torpedo shot to alter the cause of his destiny and that strategy still applies till date. The enemy uses the same old game tricks on believers even today. Today so many have fallen for that same temptation. They have walked out of the mission into turning stones into bread and that cant ever be done and they end up in circles wondering if God had forsaken them. Refuse the devils suggestions any day and anytime. Choose to remain on the Word and live daily by it. My mission this morning is not show you how subtle the enemy can be but to share with you on timeless truths of God's word and how to make faith a daily lifestyle. The response of Jesus was the one thing that has changed my life forever. One evening as I meditate on these words ""It is written: 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.' (Matthew 4:4). NOTICE: He equates living on bread to living on the Word of God. You don't eat food once a while, maybe after some months then you feel like eating again. No! it's a daily thing. The same should apply to the Word of God. The difference between the sense and the Spirit realm is ability to live in the Word. Oh! Yes. Living in the Word. I can shout that a thousand times, until all that has kept you bound for so long begins to drop off you. I decree in the name of Jesus every form of distraction set against you be unveiled by the Power of the Holy ghost."

Daniel 6:1-28,"('Deliverance', 'Satan Attacks', 'Testing Our Faith', 'Faith And Courage')",Baptist," WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU'RE ON THE MENU! Daniel 6:1-28 1 Pet 5:8 Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. Dan 6:1-9 It seemed good to Darius to appoint 120 satraps over the kingdom, that they would be in charge of the whole kingdom, 2 and over them three commissioners (of whom Daniel was one), that these satraps might be accountable to them, and that the king might not suffer loss. 3 Then this Daniel began distinguishing himself among the commissioners and satraps because he possessed an extraordinary spirit, and the king planned to appoint him over the entire kingdom. 4 Then the commissioners and satraps began trying to find a ground of accusation against Daniel in regard to government affairs; but they could find no ground of accusation or evidence of corruption, inasmuch as he was faithful, and no negligence or corruption was to be found in him. 5 Then these men said, ""We will not find any ground of accusation against this Daniel unless we find it against him with regard to the law of his God."" 6 Then these commissioners and satraps came by agreement to the king and spoke to him as follows: ""King Darius, live forever! 7 All the commissioners of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the high officials and the governors have consulted together that the king should establish a statute and enforce an injunction that anyone who makes a petition to any god or man besides you, O king, for thirty days, shall be cast into the lions' den. 8 Now, O king, establish the injunction and sign the document so that it may not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be revoked."" 9 Therefore King Darius signed the document, that is, the injunction. * The true roaring lions in this story are not the actual lions, but these 2 commissioners and the satraps. They have prowled and set the trap for Daniel in order to destroy him. They knew he was a man of honor and conviction and would not forsake his God. * Daniel, though, had to choose whether he would obey man or obey God!! Lions are hungry!! SO, WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE ON THE MENU? 1. BE FAITHFUL TO GOD. ** Remember- Daniel wasn't guilty of any kind of corruption. They were not going to trap him for being unfaithful, but for being faithful. Dan 6:10 Now when Daniel knew that the document was signed, he entered his house (now in his roof chamber he had windows open toward Jerusalem); and he continued kneeling on his knees three times a day, praying and giving thanks before his God, as he had been doing previously. The question is ""Will Daniel remain faithful to death?"" At some point in your life you may find yourself in a hard situation. It may be demanded of you to sacrifice your morals, principles, and Christian witness or suffer the consequences at work, school, etc. * You need to decide up front how you will respond. In my life, the times I've stood firm, God has always blessed me in the end. Dan 6:11-14 Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God. 12 Then they approached and spoke before the king about the king's injunction, ""Did you not sign an injunction that any man who makes a petition to any god or man besides you, O king, for thirty days, is to be cast into the lions' den?"" The king replied, ""The statement is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be revoked."" 13 Then they answered and spoke before the king, ""Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the injunction which you signed, but keeps making his petition three times a day."" 14 Then, as soon as the king heard this statement, he was deeply distressed and set his mind on delivering Daniel; and even until sunset he kept exerting himself to rescue him"
"Luke 24:49, Acts 1:4-8","('Power', 'Tongues Of Fire')",Pentecostal," Lu 24:49 Tarry Until Ye Be Endued You and I will never mature spiritually until God's words to us are taken personally as they are written. It seems that we all have this ability to take God's word and sift it until all that is left is what we like. What is comfortable convenient, easy on our flesh, what is Pleasant. It seems that some where between our ears and our hearts is this sifter that sifts out all the Commandments and all the conviction until all were left with is suggestions and blessings and the things that we want to do and the things that feel good. That's why our churches today are full of spiritual midgets, dwarfs that should be and could be men and women of great spiritual stature. They should have and could have great spiritual power and authority! but because they won't eat anything but spiritual Cream of Wheat they are spiritual dwarfs. They should be and could be Mighty Warriors but they are ""Gerber babies"" what do I mean Gerber babies? I mean cute but no power. By now they should be spiritual Warriors but instead their spiritual wimps. They've been raised on strained bananas and pureed prunes because they wouldn't take the word as it is. When we take God's word as it is: It comes loaded with vitamins and nutrients, it comes in a form that requires you to exercise your muscles and use your teeth. It comes loaded with protein and power. Jesus said the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and life. He meant if you will take them and chew them up and digest them, they will grow you up. They will build his life into you, they will build his character, his anointing his power into you. My job is ""not"" to see to it that your diet is always Cream of Wheat and pureed peas and carrots but to set the table with some filet mignon, some prime rib, some pork chops, some T-bone steaks along with some green beans spinach and broccoli. If you're able to digest everything I give you in the same service then I need to go deeper. Because you should leave with your mouth full still chewing thinking and meditating on what has been said. All through the week that word should be stirring in you, exciting you, inspiring you to pray and to read and study God's word for yourself. Acts 1:4-8 the last command of Jesus to his followers and his disciples before his Ascension was go to Jerusalem and tarry (wait) for the promise! Tarry there until you be endued with power from on high. This was not a suggestion it was a command of the master: that commandant has never been withdrawn. To every disciple to every follower of the Lord Jesus Christ, the commandant still stands. Go to Jerusalem and stay there until you be en dued with power from on high. Jesus needed that in enduement of power and he received it in the river Jordan. If the very begotten Son of God needed that Supernatural in enduement of power how much more do we need it? Out of at least 500 people Jesus spoke those words to: only 120 made it to the upper room ( that means 380 thought they had a better idea) and bypassed The Upper Room."
Hebrews 13:4,"('Morality', 'Sexual Purity', 'Sexual Immorality')",Baptist," ""Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous."" [1] Marriage is under assault in this day. I sincerely doubt that the assault is as successful as some might imagine; nevertheless, marriage is under a sustained and vigorous assault. The transformation of marriage is reflected in changes in family size and composition. Statistics Canada gives us some insight into the changes experienced within the typical Canadian family. In 1961, the average family comprised 3.9 people; by 2011, the average family comprised 2.9 people. In 2011, for the first time there were more people living alone in Canada than there were couples with children. In 2001, the most common type of family (almost 44 percent) was two parents and children under 24 years of age living together. By 2011, that figure had dropped to 40 percent; and more of those couples were not officially married. And in 2011, for the first time, for the first time, StatsCan tracked step-families, people with children from a previous marriage living in the same home. They found that about ten percent of Canadian children were living in some variation of that particular situation. [2] Between the years of 1961 and 2011, significant changes took place in the data collected. The first year in which data was available for common-law unions was 1981. In 2001, same-sex common-law couples were counted for the first time; and in 2006, same-sex ""married"" couples were counted for the first time. [3] The transformation of the family has been significant during these five decades. During this same period, the share of married-couple families has decreased while the share of lone-parent families has increased. Not surprisingly, families and households have become smaller during these same decades. [4] Throughout the past fifty years, and especially during the past two decades, marriage has been redefined through political fiat and in the popular understanding. This redefinition was inevitable when the purpose of marriage was no longer recognised. Tragically, those who should have spoken out to instruct the populace in the biblical basis for marriage were either unprepared or unwilling to risk their standing in the community. Consequently, through the silence of the pastorate, marriage is in danger of being lost to western culture. When that happens, we will enter into a new dark age from which we may well never recover. LET MARRIAGE BE HELD IN HONOUR AMONG ALL -- The verse gives two commands, emphasised with a warning. We ignore divine commands at our peril, for they do come with warnings from which there is no appeal. God has graciously blessed the west for so long that we tend to forget that He is holy. Because He is holy, we trifle with His commands at our own peril. God cannot ignore arrogance toward His holy commands; He shall hold us accountable. It would be a mistake to say that marriage is held in honour among all. Even within the congregations of the faithful, it is difficult to say that marriage is held in honour by all. To a distressing degree, the churches of this day reflect society rather than providing direction within society. It is more truthful to say that the churches of this day are guided by culture rather than providing moral guidance within culture. Pastors are more sensitive to say what is popular than to speak the truth in love. Nowhere is this more evident than in speaking of marriage."
John 3:16,"('Love', 'Family', ""God's Love"")",Baptist," Love In just a few days, we will be celebrating Valentine's Day, or St. Valentine's Day. A made up Holiday by the candy, flower, and greeting card industry designed to make husbands and boyfriends feel guilty and penniless. From what I see every Valentine's Day, the restaurant and jewelry industries are in on it too. Just exactly what do we celebrate on Valentine's Day? Ask any female over the age of 13 and they will probably tell you Love. Ask any guy over the age of 15 and he will probably tell you it's about separating him from his money. All kidding aside, I do believe the ladies get the better end of the deal. If she forgets Valentine's Day, the guy would probably be doing the happy dance, if he forgets Valentine's Day, she will be dancing on his head. I will say this, and I hope most of you men agree, I don't need some made up holiday to show my love for my wife. A good husband should do that every day. So, I got to thinking about love, how we define it, how we experience it, and what it really means. All of us have different lives, different experiences, so I looked back over my life and thought about my experiences with love. When I say love in the context of my life, I am not referring to the over trivialization of the term, like: I love pizza, or I love football, or I love airplanes... well, perhaps I do love airplanes, but that is a one sided affair. So when I speak of love in a serious manner, I do so with regard to relationships. 1. My very first relationship that was built on love would have to be my mother. I can still remember her tucking me into bed when I was a little boy. I still remember her taking care of me when I was sick, I still remember her baking me birthday cakes, and I still remember her loving me even when I wasn't very lovable. A mother's love, as I experienced it, was one of caring, compassion, and forgiveness. Then there was the love of my father. That love took many forms. From my daddy I learned that there were expectations on my behavior, not that his love was contingent on my actions, but that his love compelled me to behave certain ways. He loved me enough to teach me responsibility, accountability, and a proper work ethic. His love also taught me the meaning of discipline and the consequences of my bad behavior. Together, my parents, and grandparents, demonstrated all of the attributes of God's love. Jesus tells us about his relationship with His Father in John 5:19, ""the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do; for whatever He does, the Son does in like manner."" If a parent is doing their job, then the love they demonstrate for their children should be a prototype or a reflection of God's love for us. That's why the job we do in parenting our children is so important. As parents, we are to model the love of God to our children. 2. As I remember it, my second experience in love would be from my brother. When we were kids, we did everything together. Tim was my ""big brother"" and we had all sorts of adventures together."
Ephesians 1:3-6,"('Spiritual Blessing', 'Heavenly Realms', 'Chose Us In Him', 'He Predestined Us')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 11/30/16 Title: A Sentence Begun in Eternity (1:3-6) Series: Paul's Letter to the Ephesians Ephesians 1:3-6 (NIV) 3 Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ. 4 For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love 5 he predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will-- 6 to the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the One he loves. Introduction [Paul is already teaching us to use the grammar of the gospel.] It is because we receive grace that we become faithful; because we are ""in Christ"" we can be ""saints"" even if we live in Ephesus. What follows, however, almost suggests that Paul cared very little about ordinary grammar! While verses 3-14 are broken down into five sentences in our translation, they are actually only one sentence in Greek--stretching to over 200 words-- the longest sentence in the Word of God! They constitute a doxology, a poem of praise to God for all the blessings of the Gospel. There is a reason for this: Into these verses is woven the most thrilling account of spiritual blessings and provisions revealed in the Word of God. There is no place for a period in this account, because three persons are involved. They are inseparable, both in their being and in their activity as it relates to our salvation. Therefore, Ephesians 1:3-14 is one great sentence describing the one great provision made for hell-deserving sinners. God is to be blessed because He has blessed us (3). ""Bless"" here means ""to speak well"" of someone. We speak well of the Lord (Blessed be...God) because in Christ, the Living Word, he has spoken well (blessed) us. Dear reader, one of the richest and most overwhelming passages in the Bible is this discussion of the blessings which are ours now in Christ Jesus. Commentary ""Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ..."" It all begins in the mind of ""the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,"" the God who had revealed Himself uniquely to Jesus as Abba, Father, and had raised Him from the dead. ""...Who has blessed us in the heavenly realms..."" The word ""blessed"" has in it the thought of happiness and joy. It says ""Who has blessed us."" I can't think of anything more wonderful than this. He is not speaking here of something that may be ours when we get to heaven but of something that is ours right now. The phrase ""the heavenly realms"" does not refer to a physical reality but to a celestial region, a sphere of spiritual activities to which the believer has been lifted in Christ. This reality can be found in several places in Ephesians (1:20; 2:6; 3:10; 6:12). It refers not to the heaven of the future but to the new realm of spiritual realities, the heaven which lies even now within and around the Christian, the heaven into which believers have been brought in Christ. Believers do in reality belong to two worlds (Philippines 3:20). Temporally they belong to the earth; but spiritually their lives are linked with Christ's, and they belong to the heavenly realm. The Gospel does not promise material blessings as its central benefit (although its power in a person's life may create greater diligence and wisdom that will lead to such prosperity.) In fact, the blessings of the Gospel are for those who take up the cross and die daily (Luke 9:23); suffering with Christ is part of our inheritance in Christ: ""Now if we are children, then we are heirs--heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory"" (Romans 8:17)."
1 Corinthians 2:6-13,"('Future', 'Future Glory', 'Christ The Wisdom')",Lutheran," Who is the smartest person you know? A teacher who can spit out just about any math formula known to mankind? A mentor at your workplace who consistently makes decisions that benefit the company? A family member whose common sense has gotten you and others out of many tight spots? It is a blessing to know people like that, but it might also be intimidating. After all, no one likes to be thought of as the weak link when it comes to intelligence. That's why schools like Sturgeon Heights here in town offer a pre-kindergarten class geared towards kids whose IQ is above average. Many parents think that if they can get their child into that program, they'll have a leg up on all the other kids. Knowledge is power after all. Well that depends on what kind of knowledge you have. You may know the stats of every Oiler but does that really make you wise? Knowing, for example, that Connor McDavid has scored 18 goals in 55 NHL games isn't going to help you administer first aid to someone who has stopped breathing. Likewise those pint-sized geniuses at Sturgeon Heights School may learn more history, more science, and more math than the average preschooler. They may even study how to administer CPR. But if that's all they do, they won't come close to surpassing our preschoolers here in wisdom. Real wisdom, as we'll find out today, comes from the Spirit, it concentrates on Christ, and it culminates in glory. Let's find out more as we continue our sermon series on the church in Corinth, a church that was fully equipped with real wisdom. Our society is not the only one that pines for wisdom. The ancient Greeks valued it as well. And yet when the Apostle Paul visited the church in the Greek city of Corinth he didn't put on a dazzling display of intellectual acumen. You heard Paul confess in the Epistle lesson last week: ""My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words"" (1 Corinthians 2:4). But lest the Corinthians not take him seriously Paul went on to say in today's text: ""We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing. 7 No, we speak of God's secret wisdom"" (1 Corinthians 2:6, 7a). Do Paul's words sound a bit like a tabloid headline? ""God's Secrets Revealed!"" But Paul isn't a reporter for the National Enquirer who's making stuff up to sell newspapers. He really did have a secret wisdom from God revealed to him by the Holy Spirit. Paul explained: ""God has revealed it to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. 11 For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit within him? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God... 13 This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words"" (1 Corinthians 2:10, 11, 13)."
Revelation 19:1-6,"('Worship', 'Judgment')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Worship In Heaven Revelation 19:1-6 1 After these things I heard a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, ""Alleluia! Salvation and glory and honor and power belong to the Lord our God! 2For true and righteous are His judgments, because He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication; and He has avenged on her the blood of His servants shed by her."" 3Again they said, ""Alleluia! Her smoke rises up forever and ever!"" 4And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sat on the throne, saying, ""Amen! Alleluia!"" 5Then a voice came from the throne, saying, ""Praise our God, all you His servants and those who fear Him, both small and great!"" 6And I heard, as it were, the voice of a great multitude, as the sound of many waters and as the sound of mighty thunderings, saying, ""Alleluia! For the Lord God Omnipotent reigns! Revelation chapters 19 and 20 bring the return of Jesus to establish His Earthly Kingdom. Before we get to all that, the first 5 verses of chapter 19 show heaven's response to the judgment of the harlot. The multitude in heaven praises God for judging the great harlot. This chapter is one of the most dramatic in the Bible. Chapter 19 is the only chapter in the New Testament where the word ""Alleluia"" is found. It appears 4 times. The people mentioned here are different from the others in heaven. They are singing a song that includes mention of salvation. This scene includes the Old Testament saints, the Church age saints, and the Tribulation saints. Together they join this great chorus proclaiming. ""Alleluia!"" The scene now shifts from the earth to heaven. VERSE 1 After these things I heard a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, ""Alleluia! Salvation and glory and honor and power belong to the Lord our God! In chapter 18, we saw the terrible destruction of commercial, political and religious Babylon symbolized by its capital city of Babylon. Now the scene changes to heaven. The voices of the redeemed are heard. This ""loud voice"" is because of the number of people speaking. These words of praise are focused on the Lord Jesus. The loud voices are likely the voices of angels. The redeemed saints are not told to praise our God until verse 5. Heaven rejoices because salvation has now come for God's people. The power and glory belongs to God. VERSE 2 For true and righteous are His judgments, because He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication; and He has avenged on her the blood of His servants shed by her."" Jesus is bringing justice and righteousness to the world. Those who look to God can depend on His judgments to be true and righteous. There is never a doubt. God judged the harlot because she led the charge to get the world to worship the Antichrist and Satan. Her devotion and public commitment caused the world to copy her conduct. She caused the death of many of God's apostles, prophets and saints. In fulfillment of God's promise to the 5th seal martyrs"
"Matthew 5:21-26, Romans 12:18","('Reconciliation', 'Anger', 'Peace In The Church')",Baptist," Matthew 5:21-26 Stop the Killing Spree! William Boyette, suspected of killing four women in two states, died Tuesday from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after a police standoff at a Georgia motel. Police arrested Mary Rice, his accomplice. As appalling as their little Bonnie and Clyde killing spree was, we all engage in killing sprees from time to time with our mouths and hearts. And Jesus says, ""Stop it!"" In his famous Sermon on the Mount, Jesus addresses six areas of life, contrasting what the rabbis had taught--basically the letter of the law--with what we would call the spirit of the law, God's original intent. God is not after some legalistic obedience. He doesn't want a look-good-on-the-outside Christian; he wants an inner transformation. God wants nothing less than our hearts. He wants us to be holy as he is holy. And the first of Jesus' six areas of life is anger. You've probably heard someone say, ""I'm not a bad person; after all, I've never killed anyone."" But Jesus says anger can turn into mental murder so quickly that we have effectively killed with our emotions and words. Ambrose Bierce once said, ""Speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret."" Or consider the wisdom of Will Rogers: ""People who fly into a rage always make a bad landing."" But with God's help, we can stop the killing spree! Catch your anger before it hurts others, and when you discover others are angry because of you, do your best to make it right. So, whether you're the angry one or you're the cause of the anger, stop it! Try to make it right, especially among fellow Christians, as a watching world takes note. Let's look at Jesus' words. Beginning in verse 21, he says, 21 ""You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'You shall not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' 22 But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, 'Raca,' is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell."" When Jesus quotes the sixth commandment from Exodus 20:13, he uses a Greek word that means ""premeditated murder,"" just like the original Hebrew. The penalty was death. It was a capital offense. But Jesus goes a step further and says our anger directed towards a fellow Christian, a ""brother or sister"" in the faith, also makes us liable for judgment. Apparently, unresolved anger is very serious! So let's lighten the tension and learn some cuss words in another language. (Isn't that always fun?) ""Raca"" is Aramaic for ""empty-headed."" It sounds pretty vicious, doesn't it? And the word for ""fool""is moros in Greek, from which we get the word ""moron."" Jewish people appreciated the power of words. ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will...break my heart!"" That's the truth! Jesus says if you use some of these words in anger, your soul is in danger of hell. The word he uses for hell is ""Gehenna,"" which was an actual place. It was a ravine on the west side of Jerusalem, just outside the city gates, where a couple of evil Israelite kings had allowed human sacrifices back in the day (2 Chr. 28:3; 33). Later King Josiah desecrated the area (2Ki 23:10; see Jer. 7:31-32; 19:6). By Jesus' time, the Jews had turned it into a garbage dump where fires continually burned. It became symbolic of the eternal fires of hell."

Glenn, age 7: If falling love is anything like learning how to spell, I don't want to do it. It takes too long. Regina, age 10 agrees: I'm not rushing into love. I'm finding fourth grade hard enough. Angie, age 10: Most men are brainless, so you might have to try more than once to find a live one. Dave, age 8: Love will find you, even if you are trying to hide from it. I've been trying to hide from it since I was five, but the girls keep finding me. Manuel, age 8: I think you're supposed to get shot with an arrow or something, but the rest of it isn't supposed to be painful. ILLUS: Some recent studies tell us that when a person is in love, their brain lights up. When you're in love, your eyes light up, your face lights up - and apparently, so do 4 tiny bits of your brain. According to Andreas Bartels, a research fellow at University College London: It is the common denominator of romantic love. When test subjects were shown photographs of their sweethearts... certain areas of their brain just lit up - which means there's a higher flow of blood going to that part of the brain. These ""love spots"" were near, but not the same as, sections that become active when someone is feeling simple lust. And - in addition - looking at these pictures of their sweethearts also reduced activity in 3 larger areas that are active when people are upset or depressed. (Janet McConnaughey R.Digest 9/01) APPLY: In the text we're looking at this morning, Jesus is SCOLDING the church at Ephesus. They've lost something. What have they lost? (Their First Love) And Jesus rebukes them for it. ""Nevertheless I have this against you, that you have left your first love. Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent and do the first works, or else I will come to you quickly and remove your lampstand from its place--unless you repent."" Revelation 2:4-5 It's like Jesus is telling them there's certain parts of brains that don't light up like they used to. But how did that happen? How did they lose their first love for Jesus? Was it kinda like when you lose your keys or your TV remote? I mean - did they just misplace Jesus somewhere along the line? Well yes... and no. I've known people (and whole churches) that have lost their first love for Jesus. But they didn't wake one morning and say ""I'm going to walk away from Jesus today."" If they gave any thought to it at all - if they even realized it had happened - they might say that their love for Him was just missing. They'd say it feels like they've MISPLACED that love and they just don't know where it went. But that's not actually what happens. They don't MIS-place Jesus... they RE-place Jesus. It's kind of like a man who loses his love for his wife - and runs off with another woman. Most adulterers don't set out to do that. They don't just wake up one day and say ""Hey, I think I'll leave my wife today."" Richard John Hayton commented on Apr 1, 2017 Dear Jeff. I have been a pastor of a Baptist church in England for more than 20 years. I regularly find that it is the sermons you submit that help to inspire me most often. Thank you for this one too. I have most recently been preaching a series on different prodigals, currently on ""The Prodigal Church"" using the letters in Revelation as the base. Thank you for what you do it is most appreciated.

1 Corinthians 13:4-13,"(""Jesus' Love"", 'Jesus Loves You')",Christian/Church Of Christ," ""Jesus' Love Is...."" 1 Corinthians 13:4-13 David P. Nolte Someone cataloged three kinds of ""love."" One kind is the ""IF"" love. ""I will love you (IF you treat me like royalty; IF you give me whatever I want whenever I want it; IF you never do anything I think is stupid!""). The second kind of love is the ""BECAUSE"" love. ""I love you (BECAUSE you are funny; BECAUSE you are handsome; BECAUSE you haven't given me grief!""). The third kind of love is the ""IN SPITE OF"" love. ""I love you (IN SPITE OF your failures; IN SPITE OF your having hurt me; IN SPITE OF your sins!""). One problem with the ""IF"" and ""BECAUSE"" so-called ""love"" is that should the basis for those loves ceases to be or changes, the pseudo-love dies. When we consider what Jesus did for us IN SPITE OF the cost; IN SPITE OF our sin; IN SPITE OF the pain we bring Him, we are compelled to say, ""If that isn't love The ocean is dry There's no stars in the sky And the sparrow can't fly. If that isn't love Then Heaven's a myth There's no feeling like this If that isn't love."" There are many Scriptures that showcase His love for us, but the one that seems to say it all is Paul's definition of love: ""Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant, does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be done away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part; but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away. When I was a child, I used to speak like a child, think like a child, reason like a child; when I became a man, I did away with childish things. For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I also have been fully known. But now faith, hope, love, abide these three; but the greatest of these is love."" 1 Corinthians 13:4-13 (NASB). I want to bundle those thoughts into three headings to describe His love. I. HIS LOVE IS UNQUENCHABLE: A. An unknown author wrote: ""Love is the spark that kindles the fires of compassion. Compassion is the fire that flames the candle of service. Service is the candle that ignites the torch of hope. Hope is the torch that lights the beacon of faith. Faith is the beacon that reflects the power of God. God is the power that creates the miracle of love."" B. Solomon wrote, ""Many waters cannot quench love, Nor will rivers overflow it."" Song of Songs 8:7 (NASB). 1. Adam Clarke commented, ""Neither common nor uncommon adversities, even of the most ruinous nature, can destroy love when it is pure."" 2. His love is pure and our many sins, failures and provocations have not quenched it. 3. His love remains even when it has been tested and tried and challenged, rebuffed and even rejected."

Romans 10:10,"('Saving Faith', 'False Faith')",Baptist," Nominal Christians When I was a kid, the Apollo missions were in the news daily. I still remember sitting in front of our little black and white TV watching Neil Armstrong take that first step onto the surface of the moon. Having watched all of the launches, I remember a saying the astronauts would use, ""all systems nominal."" Nominal is defined as 1. Existing as something in name only: not actual or real, 2. A very small amount. After I looked up the definition of nominal, it occurred to me that this doesn't make much sense. However, there is a new phenomenon in America that uses this term that makes perfect sense. The new catch phrase in Christian circles is ""nominal Christian."" Christians existing as something in name only, not actual or real. In the USA, 70% of the population claim to be Christian, but less than half of that number says that religion is important in their lives. Having read this statistic got me to wondering; just exactly what is a Christian anyway? If 70% of our Nation is Christian, then there is something seriously wrong with our faith. And if less than half of that number believe that religion is import in their lives, then are they really Christians? Well, only God can answer for certain if a person does or doesn't belong to Him, but that still leaves me with the legitimate question of ""how do I define a Christian?"" According to the world, a Christian is anyone who says they are. And for that reason, the definition of a Christian in the eyes of the world is skewed and maligned on a daily basis. There are all manner of people in the world today who openly live in every imaginable sinful lifestyle who claim to be Christians; thieves, liars, adulterers, fornicators, homosexuals, child molesters, etc. etc... I am not saying that Christians are sinless, but what I am saying is that a true Christian would not willingly and openly continue living a life that God the Father has called sin or an abomination. So how do we define a Christian? In its essence the term means to be Christ like. As a Pastor and believer, I define a Christian as one who has savingly believed in Jesus as God's Son, has repented of their sins, and confessed their faith in Jesus as their savior. Ro 10:10 Says, ""for with the heart one believes unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."" 1Jn 1:9 says, ""If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."" Now, once this has happened, the new believer is transformed, given a new life, and is empowered by the Holy Spirit. Now the question is, what are we empowered by the Holy Spirit to do? Well, according to Col 2:6 ""As you therefore have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him."" So if I have received Jesus I am to walk in Him, what does that involve? Eph 2:10 says, ""For we are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them."""
Acts 2:44-47,"('Salvation', 'Obedience', 'Community Of Faith')",Baptist," The Blessing of Community Acts 2: 44-47 The verses we have read offer insight into the makeup of the early church. This was a very exciting time in the lives of those within the church. The early believers had only one thing on their minds - to serve the Lord in such a way that would honor Him and reach those who had not yet come to know the Lord. There is no doubt we are blessed at Fellowship, but I wonder at times if we are actually receiving the full benefit of community within the church. When we study the lives and commitment of early believers, it is apparent they enjoyed much that has been lost down through the years. As the Lord designed the church, He intended for it to be a community of believers benefiting from one another, while contributing to the good of the entire body. As we continue in our series: Church - A New Testament Model, I want to examine the attributes within the early church as we consider: The Blessing of Community. I. The Fellowship of the Church (44a) - And all that believed were together. We find the early believers all came together. This wasn't a select few who had met for worship; ALL the people had come together. There was a great sense of fellowship among all the believers. They didn't have mini-congregations within the body; they all stood together and fellowshipped with one another. If we are to be all that we could be, we must all come together. We all share a common bond - saving grace through our Lord. We are all going to spend eternity in heaven together. We must be willing to fellowship together in this life? Genuine fellowship within the church requires more than just gathering under the same roof. We must all come together, desiring to be together. The church will never prosper and be all it can and should be without unity and fellowship among the believers. II. The Focus of the Church (44b) - And all that believed were together, and had all things common. They were a group of believers who not only enjoyed a close fellowship, but shared a common focus. They shared of their possessions, but more importantly they shared a desire for the things of God. When they came together for worship there was a common desire to serve the Lord in a way that pleased Him. They were willing to sacrifice of themselves for the good of the church. They weren't bogged down with petty debates and meaningless disputes. They had all things common. If we are to become what we need to be, we must all share a common focus. We must all agree on why we are here. We have not come to please ourselves, but to serve the Lord. It isn't about us; it is all about Him! Jesus is the reason we have come today and we must make Him the focus and the desire of our hearts. Many churches never prosper because they can never agree on what they need to accomplish. Do you ever consider why we are here? What is our purpose for being here? Can you imagine what this congregation could achieve if we had all things in common? We need to embrace the vision and see the big picture. We have a wonderful opportunity to make a difference in the lives of people, but we must come together to achieve it!"
"Hebrews 11:23-27, Exodus 2:1-11","('Mothers', 'Faith Alive', 'Committed Motherhood.')",Assembly Of God," Tribute to Mothers Mother's Day. Hebrews 11:23-11:27 Exodus 2: 1-11 INTRODUCTION Moses' mother, Jochebed, was a Hebrew woman living in slavery in Egypt before the exodus. She was the daughter of a Levite, and she married Amram, another Levite Exodus 2:1. According to Exodus 6:20, Amran was her nephew; thus, she was Amram's aunt as well as his wife. We know that Moses was born several years after their marriage because she already had a daughter who was old enough at the time of Moses' infancy to act as a lookout (Exodus 2:4). This was l Moses' sister Miriam , who is mentioned by name in Exodus 15:20. Along with Moses and Miriam, Jochebed had at least one other sibling, Moses' brother Aaron (Exodus 6:20). It difficult being a Christian mother today . But as hard as that may be, we need to realize that difficulties are not unique to our time. In every age motherhood has had its share of difficulties. Today I want to talk about Jochebed, the mother of Moses, who reared Moses up in a difficult time, and in a pagan culture. The Hebrews had been in Egypt for 400 years. Though at first welcomed during a famine Joseph had prophesied through Pharaoh's dreams, after his death they multiplied so rapidly that the Egyptians felt threatened, ultimately leading them to force the Hebrews into slavery. Yet the Hebrew population continued to increase. In a desperate measure to control this population growth, Pharaoh direct that all male babies under two years old were to be killed. Moses was born at this time , so you can imagine the horror Jochebed experienced. Moses' mother hid Moses for three months, because she saw that he was a fine child. After 3 months or so he probably started crawling around a bit and it would have been increasingly difficult to hide him. So in verse three she makes this basket, waterproofs it, puts Moses in it, and launches it from the reeds in a quiet little corner of the Nile River. Now notice the irony there. Pharoah had ordered all the boys to be thrown in the Nile so they would be drowned. But here Moses mother puts him in the Nile to be saved. Cleverly then we read that she sent his sister (who would just be a child herself) to watch and see what happens. This was wise because no doubt when the baby was found, the people would be looking around to see if the mother was nearby. But a little girl would attract little attention. So Pharoah's daughter a princess, is bathing in the river with her entourage, saw the basket and sent one of her slave girls to fetch it. She saw that it was a handsome Hebrew boy and it says she felt sorry for it as she saw Moses crying in the basket. As far as we know this princess was not yet a mother but thankfully she had the gift that God gives to most if not all women, that motherly instinct to love and care for all children. Now I don't know how old Moses' sister Miriam was, and we don't know if her mother told her what to do, but somehow God directed her to instruct the sister what to say to the princess. Obviously the princess and her slaves wouldn't be able to nurse the baby, so the sister cleverly asks the princess if she can go get a Hebrew woman to nurse the baby for her. A very helpful suggestion from this little girl and the princess agrees, telling her to go do so."
1 John 4:7-20,"('Brother', 'Love', 'Salvation', 'Knowing God')",Baptist," ""All you need is Love"" 1st John 4: 7-21 It would be virtually impossible to determine the number of love songs that have been written across the years. Lionel Richie wrote endless love. The Bee Gees wrote how deep is your love? Whitney Houston sang I will always love you. Google says it cannot offer a number of love songs ever written because by the time you counted them the number would be completely obsolete. According to writers it is the one topic that everyone wants to hear-being sung about-never goes out of style-always matters. In fact the Beatles wrote that all you need is love. Nothing else. But larger than all that the apostle Paul wrote that these three things matter. Faith, hope and love and the greatest of these is love. We find the word love mentioned over 500 times in the Scripture. And over 20 times in the passage we're reading today. First John 4:7-21 The word John uses over and over here is the word agape. And it is one of several words used in the Scripture to define love. One is eros. It is romantic love. The kind we talk about often at Valentine's day. There is phileo. It is brotherly love. We join the words adelphos and phileo to form Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love. Then there is the word agape and that is what John uses here. Every single time. It is love that has no restraints. No conditions. Does not matter if someone loves us back. The writer John is believed to be the same one who gave us the gospel of John, one, two, three John and also the amazing book of Revelation. His insight, his death, his passion speaks to us through this passage. Look with me at what John has to say about real love. First of all real love is always a copy of the father's love for us. In life we should look for models, examples, mentors who can help us become better people. Once a month I meet with 12 other pastors in this area for three hours to pray together, study together and to hear the teaching of pastors whom I greatly respect. Pastors who have grown in areas where I am still lacking. Because none of us have arrived and we all need the example of others and we will all benefit from the example of other disciples/believers/teachers. To his we meet together each month, iron sharpens iron and we all become better leaders. Now every one of us should be meeting with a group of believers on a regular basis. Their influence rubs off on us and ours on them and together we grow. It is what Jesus did for 3.5 years with the disciples and he still expects us to do the same. And this is why. There is a simple formula here in this 2nd point. 2nd, Real love is not complete until we give it away. Look at these 3 truths with me. (1) Real love begins with God. John reminds us in this passage that God is love. He defines God in three ways in this little book. God is love. God is light. God is spirit. These are not simply attributes of God. They actually defined who God is. And real love begins with God. Verse seven. (2) Real love validates our relationship with God. Love is what makes our relationship with God legit. Verse 8."
2 Kings 6:8-23,"('Angels', 'Miracles', 'Blindness', 'Insight')",Independent/Bible," Elisha the Eye Prophet (2 Kings 6:8-23) We are all vulnerable in different ways: 1. ""In 1991, an organization called Michigan's Timid Motorist assisted 830 motorists across the MacKinac Bridge that is five miles long and 200 feet high. The drivers were so scared of heights that they couldn't drive their own cars. In the same year, more than a thousand motorists received assistance at Maryland's Chesapeake Bay Bridge - also 200 feet high and four miles long."" [Andrew Drury]. 2. We Vasiceks have been on many, many cave tours. Guides always turn off the lights at a certain point so that we can appreciate total darkness. 3. Some people are so blind, that is all they see. Others can see shadows or make out images out of the corners of their eyes. Low vision vs. legally blind. Blindness of one sort or another -- and its alleviation -- play a prominent role in today's text. Exodus 4:11, ""Then the Lord said to him, ""Who has made man's mouth? Who makes him mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, the Lord?"" 4. The Bible also suggests the idea of a spiritual blindness. (Mt. 15:14) Jesus talks about the blind leading the blind. The apostle John talks about walking in the darkness, another imagery for spiritual blindness and even defiance. 5. Our eyes are an important source of gathering information, understanding. But we can only take in so much. And we simply do not know everything. Main Idea: This may be the information age, but God is the ultimate information regulator. He determines what we do and do not perceive. I. Elisha, As God's Representative, Grants the Power to See or NOT See. A. Elisha ""Sees"" the Syrian King's PLANS (8-12) B. Elisha Sees the INVISIBLE Chariots of Fire (13-17) My favorite angel joke: A young mouse and its mother are scurrying near a cave when they see a bat fly overhead. ""Look, mom, "" said the youngster, ""an angel!"" A legion of stories about people encountering angels, usually as men who disappear or even as a bright light. Some probably true, some undoubtedly not. Maybe you? We should never give glory to angels; they are merely God's servants. God doesn't need a crew and He doesn't need you. But He pleasures in working through agents. If God were to open our eyes in this manner, we would see many angels and demons in our lifetime. C. Elisha Removes the SIGHT of the Syrian Army (18-20) Matthew 26:53, ""Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?"" D. Elisha RESTORES the Sight of the Syrian Army (21-23) "" Treated more like guests than captives. After all, they freely came to Samaria. II. What Can We Learn from All This DRAMA? A. Some people prefer denial to WARNING. 1. I understand the ""Boy who cried 'Wolf!'"" syndrome. 2. But God's Word is filled with warnings that we must take seriously. 3. Many people cope with life's fears via denial. B. God does not honor PRIVACY laws. Psalm 139:4, ""Even before a word is on my tongue, behold, O Lord, you know it altogether."" Hebrews 4:13, "" And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account."""
James 1:22-25,"('Blessed', 'Active Faith', 'Bible Application', 'Bona Fide')",Baptist," Bona Fide A study of James Part 6 "" Just do it"" How many of you have ever put anything together without reading the instructions? How many times has this worked out with less than perfect results? Most things in life require instructions Things that seem so simple to us now as adults Were once difficult tasks Tying your own shoes Going to the bathroom by yourself All second nature for most of us now But even these simple things required instruction at one time in our lives Think about trying to bake a cake or a pan of cornbread without a recipe Or build a building with a blueprint Even easy things like putting together a bicycle for Christmas Or tying a knot Require some form of instruction Without instructions We could very well have ended up sitting here in diapers With our shoes untied this morning Without instruction we could build building that look like the leaning tower of Pizza Or bake cakes that looked and tasted more like mud pies than dessert And I shudder to think of the two seated Three wheeled bicycles sitting under the tree on Christmas morning You see We need instructions But In order for those instructions to be effective We need to listen to them Or read them But even more so we must apply them Simply reading them Or hearing them And then Going on our way Is a recipe for a mess Or even a disaster in some cases --- Pause-- If we can agree here this morning that Instructions have value If we can agree on the importance of reading, listening to and using the instructions in the areas of everything to personal hygiene to building construction Why do we have so much trouble following God's instructions for our lives? Today we will continue on our quest to connect the dots that James Lays out for us To help us become Bona Fide Believers in Christ Those believers that the world sees as Genuine The Real deal We have looked at trials, storms and wrecks. Their causes and our reactions to them We have studied about testing and temptations Endurance and perseverance Standing firm and wavering Allowing ourselves to be blown by the wind ---Pause--- In the last couple of weeks We have looked at our own hearts Prayerfully with a discerning eye And discovered that our temptation to sin comes from our own hearts and our own desires God uses the wrecks that surrender causes And Old slick uses our temptation against us to attempt to lure us away But the temptations themselves come from inside of us Then we connected yet another dot Actually 3 more dots As we learned that in order to be Bona Fide And in order to show the love of Jesus We must be quick to listen Active listening we called that And slow to speak Meaning we need to engage our hearts and minds before engaging our mouths Then we discussed the two types of anger Righteous anger Things that go against God and his word And Human Anger We saw how we must not sin in either type But focused on the fact that the anger that comes from our hearts Never pleases God And actually hurts the cause for Christ Today James Continues this line of teaching He continues"
"Psalms 146:1-10, Romans 13:1-5","('Government', 'Trust God', 'Authority')",Christian/Church Of Christ," Introduction: A. One day during the presidential transition, the ""lame duck"" President met with his successor in the Oval Office. 1. Near the end of the orientation, the outgoing President presented the incoming President three numbered envelopes, with specific instructions to open them, in order, when great difficulties arose. 2. After the new President completed his ""honeymoon"" period with the media and the public, the nation experienced an economic downturn. 3. The new President opened the first envelope and inside was a card that read: ""Blame me."" 4. So he did. He criticized the former administration and things settled down. 5. After a while, social upheaval brought about a critical domestic crisis. 6. The President opened the second envelope and inside was a card that read: ""Blame my party."" 7. He did so, in an overt display of partisan politics and again things settled down. 8. About a year later, his foreign policy resulted in serious problems and the President opened the third envelope. 9. Inside, the card read: ""Prepare three envelopes."" B. Thankfully, the 2016 presidential election and inauguration are now over, and, in what very few could ever have imagined, Donald Trump has become the President of the United States. 1. No matter what our differences politically or otherwise, surely we can all agree that this campaign has been demoralizing and even traumatizing for most of the country. 2. But unfortunately, the great divide in our country and the hostile feelings and reactions that swirled around this election are not easing up. 3. Since the inauguration and some of the new administrations first moves to put a cabinet in place and begin policy changes, there have been protests and violence. 4. It feels a little bit like the world has gone crazy! C. For several weeks now, I have felt compelled to try to bring a message of wisdom and peace for our congregation in the midst of the chaos and unrest around us. 1. As you know, I don't like to talk about politics, and actually this sermon is not about politics. 2. This sermon is about how we, as Christians, should conduct ourselves in the midst of a fractured nation. 3. So, initially, I thought of this sermon as a break in my Transforming Truths series, but then I realized that I didn't have to break into the series I had planned, because today's lesson is another important truth that needs to be added to the series. 4. Today's transforming truth is the fact that we can be good citizens, and that ultimately, God requires that we strive to be good citizens. 5. What I hope to do in today's sermon is to give us some perspective on God's principles for citizenship and to help us apply them to our present situation and always. D. The first thing I want to emphasize is a truth that I point to anytime I discuss politics and elections, and it is the truth that God is in control. 1. When Jesus' life was in the hands of Pilate, He made this important point to Pilate. a. The conversation went like this, ""Pilate said, 'Do you refuse to speak to me? Don't you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?' Jesus answered, 'You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above.' "" (John 19:10-11)"
Acts 4:31-37,"('Giving', 'Purpose', 'Unity', 'Committment')",Christian/Church Of Christ," The 3 C's of a Healthy Church - Celebrate a Shared Vision Acts 4:31-37 (p. 761) February 19, 2017 Introduction: Every Sunday afternoon while I was growing up you'd find me and my brother Sammy glued to the TV watching Ohio Valley Wrestling. And let me tell you...We got into it...cheering for our hero and booing the ones we loved to hate. SHOW PICS AS NAMES ARE MENTIONED BELOW When Randy ""The Macho Man"" Savage took the ring against ToJo Yamamoto or Jerry ""the King"" Lawler went against Rick Flair it was easy to tell who the good guy was and who the bad guy was. It was part of the fun. Having your favorite come off the top rope with an atomic elbow to put the enemy down for the 3 count was awesome! But sometimes, over time, the bad guy would become the good guy and vice versa...Sammy and I hated that...it's hard to cheer for ToJo Yamamoto as a good guy after he's clocked your hero with that wooden shoe. Once you have a certain perception about someone...it's hard to change that perception. When I was growing up here in Lexington KY...in the Bible belt church was the norm... On Sunday and Wednesday nights we went to church...Most of my neighbors and friends went to church or Mass. We grew up learning the common Bible Stories. Church was part of our everyday life...We knew what it was to be saved...to be ""washed in the blood,"" to go to a revival...Church was the good guy. But now we live in a culture where most people don't attend church anymore. The North American Mission Board did an assessment of churches in the South and said, ""Most churches are not growing here. Statistics show that like most regions, most people don't attend church regularly here."" As they talked to a multitude of people and asked, ""Why don't you attend church?"" They were told church was ""boring,"" ""hypocritical,"" ""stuffy,"" ""irrelevant,"" ""out of touch,"" ""all about the money,"" ""a big show"" and many other unflattering things. (Be Mean About the Vision by Shawn Lovejoy p. 13-14) So why has the perception of the church changed? Why do most unbelievers and those who didn't grow up in it, and many who did, want nothing to do with it? As our nation becomes more and more unchurched is there anything we can do? Why do they believe the church is now the ""bad guy?"" I. IT'S TIME FOR THE CHURCH TO WRESTLE WITH GOD If you're familiar with the Old Testament at all you know God's chosen nation, Israel, was named after a man. He was a twin...the 2nd out of the womb. His brother was named ""Esau,"" which means Red and Hairy. (Lousy name huh?) He was given the name Jacob which means ""deceiver."" (Even lousier right?) And for the 1st part of his life Jacob wised up to his name...He spent the first half of his life deceiving, manipulating and using people to succeed...He even stole his brother's birthright in Genesis 25."
Mark 5:21-43,"('Faith', 'Jairus', 'Raising The Dead')",Evangelical Free," Let's continue to worship our God by learning form the Gospel by Mark. We have noted from the beginning of the Gospel that Jesus Christ was proclaimed Messiah God by prophets in the Old Testament and then John the Baptist prepared the way for Christ for the people of Israel. After He was water baptized as an adult, Jesus Christ immediately started His ministry by proclaiming the perfect eternal love of God through faith in Him. Faith in Jesus Christ provides for salvation from the judgment of sins and assures eternal life with a Holy God. This is our faith!! Amen?? Jesus Christ ministered by proclaiming God's Word and that He is the Word; Jesus performed physical miracles, rebuked demons, and explained what faith is. We can state from what we've learned so far that Faith in Jesus Christ requires a response and continued action till we get to heaven. With these truths in mind, let us continue to learn from Mark 5........... Last week we learned from the healed woman in Mark 5:25-34. We will learn from Jairus and the healing of his daughter today. Read along with me starting with Mark 5:21....43... There is so much to learn from this passage but let us simply learn from the main characters of this story.Let us learn from Jairus, the People by Jairus' home, the disciples, and of course from Jesus. Jairus: v22-23: a synagogue leader = a church leader = a believer of God, God's Word, and a worship leader; And what did this church leader do based on v22-23?? - Like the healed woman who had faith, Jairus obviously searched for and went to Jesus (leaving a dying daughter behind) - Humbled himself before Jesus (what does this indicate about Jairus' view of Jesus??) - What does it mean that Jairus pleaded earnestly?? Jairus asked with all of his heart! - Let us note that Jairus loved his daughter! - And what does it indicate about Jairus asked Jesus to just place His hand on his daughter?? Jairus had strong faith in Jesus as God! Before we talk about Jesus, let's note the people in Jairus' home and the Disciples. Jairus' neighbors: v35?? - they limited themselves to things of the earth not grasping the power of God; they only had a secular worldview! In their eyes, she was dead! v38-40: Wailing and crying, then laughing at Jesus?? The wailing and crying were for show! They must have already heard about Jesus but yet they just laughed at him. The wailers were professionals; they did their best crying and wailing for attention to make money! I think this is what we can note: People can be so caught up in making money they will laugh at God! Let's make a few notes about the Disciples: We read in Matthew 9:18-19... While he was saying this, a synagogue leader came and knelt before him and said, ""My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live."" Jesus got up and went with him, and so did his disciples. - Committed to following Jesus - v37,40: 3 of the 12 had a special calling but we hear no complaining And finally, what can we note about Jesus Christ? v24: responded positively to a humble plea"

The disciples woke him and said to him, ""Teacher, don't you care if we drown?"" 39 He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, ""Quiet! Be still!"" Then the wind died down and it was completely calm. 40 He said to his disciples, ""Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?"" 41 They were terrified and asked each other, ""Who is this?

Matthew 27:11-26,"('Pilate', 'Gabbatha', 'Pontius Pilate')",Assembly Of God," CHRIST BEFORE PILATE, PILATE BEFORE CHRIST Mt. 27:11-26; Jn. 19:6-12 INTRODUCTION A. HUMOR: THE STATE DINNER 1. A New York Governor invited a group of clergy to the State House on a Friday for breakfast. However, as soon as they all were seated and the food was delivered to the table, he began to wonder whether he had made a faux pas by serving meat on a Friday. 2. ""Please don't worry, Governor,"" said the Catholic priest. ""Since we instituted Vatican II, we can now eat meat on Fridays. So it's no problem now!"" 3. They all looked at the Jewish representative. He looked down at the large portion of bacon on his plate. Rabbi Levy said to the Governor, ""I'm sorry, Governor, but I can't eat this - we are still operating under Sinai I."" B. TEXT 11 Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, ""Are you the king of the Jews?"" ""You have said so,"" Jesus replied. 12 When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer. 13 Then Pilate asked him, ""Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?"" 14 But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge--to the great amazement of the governor. 15 Now it was the governor's custom at the festival to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. 16 At that time they had a well-known prisoner whose name was Jesus Barabbas. 17 So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, ""Which one do you want me to release to you: Jesus Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?"" 18 For he knew it was out of self-interest that they had handed Jesus over to him. 19 While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message: ""Don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him."" 20 But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed. 21 ""Which of the two do you want me to release to you?"" asked the governor. ""Barabbas,"" they answered. 22 ""What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called the Messiah?"" Pilate asked. They all answered, ""Crucify him!"" 23 ""Why? What crime has he committed?"" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, ""Crucify him!"" 24 When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. ""I am innocent of this man's blood,"" he said. ""It is your responsibility!"" 25 All the people answered, ""His blood is on us and on our children!"" 26 Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified. C. THESIS 1. No one took Jesus' life; He gave it voluntarily. His death purchased our salvation. 2. It's not automatic; we must personally accept Jesus as our Savior and Lord. 3. PILATE'S INFAMY. The Roman Empire had thousands of provincial officials over its 800 year reign, but only one of them is remembered. 4. Millions of Christians mention him when saying the Apostle's Creed or the Nicene Creed - ""crucified under Pontius Pilote."
"John 14:6, John 1:14-17","('Baptism', 'Revelation', 'Holy Spirit', 'Salvation', 'Discipleship', 'Truth', 'Life', 'Repentance', 'Divinity', 'Way', 'Gospel Of Christ', 'Obey The Truth')",Christian/Church Of Christ," INTRODUCTION Outline. 1. I Am the Way 2. I Am the Truth 3. I Am the Life Remarks. 1. In this lesson we are going to discuss the theme: ""Christ's Divine Declarations."" The Lord made three of them, they are: First, I am the Way to the Father. Second, I am the Truth. And finally, I am the Life. We shall also deal with the false notions that ""all roads will lead to heaven."" We will also make it clear that ""all truth resides in Christ; revealed by the Holy Spirit and preached by the apostles."" And finally, we will establish that Christ came to provide the means of ""eternal life"" to all those that believe and obey Him. 2. First, we will consider the declaration, ""that Jesus is the way unto the Father."" John the Baptist announced that he was sent to ""prepare the way of the Lord."" Isaiah prophesied that Jehovah would send a forerunner before the Messiah's appearance to ""make straight the way of the Lord."" Isaiah prophesied that He would reveal ""the way of holiness and no unclean thing shall pass over it; it shall be for the wayfaring man, though fool should not stumble in it."" Jesus called this path the ""straight and narrow way that leadeth unto life."" 3. Second, we will discuss the declaration, ""that Jesus is the truth"" that was sent to make known the Father. He also declared, that the believers would ""know the truth, and that truth would make one free."" Freedom from sin is made possible to the disciples after they hear, believe and obey the truth of the gospel, which will ""make them free from their sins."" Recall that the apostle Paul wrote to the Romans, ""But God be thanked that ye were the servants of sin; but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you, being then made from sins, ye became the servants of righteousness."" This is that same truth that Jesus spake about that would make one free from their sin. This is that same truth the Lord revealed unto the holy apostles and prophets by the Holy Spirit. 4. Lastly, we will investigate the declaration, ""I am the life."" Jesus makes it clear after one finds the way; obey the truth, they shall obtain eternal life. Many today are supposing that they are in the way; that they believe on Christ; and they have been granted eternal life. However, their claims do not find sanction in the New Testament. As Jesus is the revealer of the way; the truth, He also has made manifest the hope of eternal life. The Lord states: ""I am come that ye might have life and have it more abundantly."" Eternal life is found in the ""Son of God"" and it is to them He ""gave the power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name."" With this brief introduction, let's consider our first thought: ""I am the way."" BODY OF LESSON I I AM THE WAY A. Jehovah's promise of the way. Isaiah the prophet spoke of this way; in terms that clearly reveal it true purpose of the way. He says: ""And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein,"" Isaiah 35:8. Jehovah promised to provide the ""Way of holiness"" unto the world. Recall the Hebrew writer's message about holiness: ""Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord,"" Hebrews 12:13-14. The ""Way of holiness"" began to be preached by John the Baptist in a preparatory form of the gospel."

Because of injuries he has played in just 10 games over two seasons, and I suppose is frustrated with his low pay since his over ten million dollar a year contract isn't cutting it. Currently, he is in default on a $575,000 loan that he made at a shockingly high 85% interest rate (which you would think was illegal...but it was made in Nevada). He owes $1.2 million to another loan service, has $2.5 million a year garnished from his wages to pay for alimony and child support, owes on most of his 12 cars including a Rolls Royce convertible & two Land Rovers. According to the AP report, household expenses cost him $30,000 a month, while $17,000 a month goes out to family and friends, $1000 goes out to cable and satellite television, and for some reason $350,000 a month goes out to Juwan Howard. The seven footer has made $57 million over 9 years, but has had to foreclose on his Chicago mansion. Regardless of the amount of money this pro ball player makes, he will not be able to pay back his debt. A debt he can't repay. As absurd as this person's story is, the reality is that's the boat we're all in; spiritually, that is. We 'accumulated' a debt of sin that cannot be repaid on our own. That's where Jesus comes in. He has the means to pay the debt for us; and he did. And when we received his 'offer' we had our massive debt removed; wiped clean; canceled. Okay, now what? There are two different responses we can have when our debt is canceled-a proper and an improper response. Let's take a look at them. 1) What do we do as an improper response to canceled debt? Start accumulating more debt. Think if the basketball player had the opportunity to have his enormous debt wiped out. Can you imagine how excited and relieved he'd be? Then picture him responding to that unbelievable gift by going out and continuing his foolish spending and accumulating more debt! But it happens. People claim bankruptcy and then go out and start racking up more debt. And then they claim bankruptcy again! What does this behavior stem from? They claim bankruptcy and go right back to accumulating more debt. Why? Because they either don't know any other way to be or they don't care. They didn't learn the lesson that their poor choices got them into this mess. It can be the same way spiritually. An improper response to having our spiritual debt canceled is to go right back to living how we always did. It could be because we know no other way to live so we're just acting according to how we always lived. But that's not a valid excuse because before we didn't have the Holy Spirit living in us enabling us to live the better way. Now we do and we are called to live according to our new nature. So it's a choice if we continue to live according to our old nature. Or, it could be we don't care. We know the power is there but we just don't care to change. I would say this response is due to wanting to be saved but not wanting to change. We want Jesus to be our Savior but not our Lord. And that doesn't work; trust me."
Titus 1:1-4,"('Service', 'Ministry', 'Christian Service')",Baptist," Saved To Serve Titus 1:1-4 Before I became a pastor I was in management. In those years I hired many people. During that time I never hired anyone just to give them benefits. I hired them to do a job that would benefit the company. Once they were hired and began to work they did however receive many benefits. They were provided with Health insurance, Dental insurance, Vision insurance, Holiday pay, Two weeks vacation and several other benefits. Each week they received a salary that enabled them to Pay their mortgage, purchase a car, put gas in it, maintain it and insure it. Because of the wages they received they could feed and clothe their children. But ultimately they were hired to do a job. For those who are children of God their are many benefits. We are provided with salvation and eternal life, we have a relationship with the Father, we are adopted into the family of God, we are joint heirs with Jesus, we have a home in Heaven and we have the opportunity for an abundant life while we are here on earth. These are just a few of the benefits of being a child of God. But God did not just save you to keep you from Hell. He did not redeem you simply to give you a home in Heaven. Our ultimate purpose in this life is to bring honor and glory to our Heavenly Father. If that is true (and it is) then it is safe to say that you were SAVED TO SERVE! If you look at the life an ministry of the Apostles it becomes clear that Jesus had a plan for them. Yes, they received many benefits from following the Savior. But they were called, commanded and commissioned to share the Gospel for the remainder of their lives. In our selected text we find that this was not just the case for the original 12. It is the case for everyone who is ""in Christ"". I would like to look at the first four verses of Paul's epistle to Titus and see that we are ""Saved To Serve"". In this passage we see that: i. Paul was saved to serve ii. Titus was saved to serve iii. You were saved to serve - Let's begin in verse 1 and see that: I. Paul Was Saved To Serve - In the church's infancy there were not many people who were feared more than a man named Saul of Tarsus. He was a devout Jew... a self described ""Pharisee of Pharisees"". He spent his days persecuting Christians and seeking the complete destruction of the Church. When Stephen was stoned to death, Saul was there consenting unto his death. What Saul of Tarsus did not know was that God had chosen him for a specific task. He would soon become one of the greatest leaders & missionaries in this church that he fought so hard to destroy - Consider if you will: A. Paul's Calling - v1a Paul, a servant of God Paul refers to Himself as a ""servant of God"". The Greek word is ""doulos"", meaning a slave. Paul's proclaims that his life was no longer his own. He belonged to God and his Savior Jesus Christ. How did this happen? What brought about this transformation? Well, back in Acts Chapter 9, this great persecutor had an encounter with the Savior. Saul was headed to Damascus with the intentions of bringing Christians bound back to Jerusalem in order to persecute them. There on Damascus Road, Jesus appeared to Saul and changed his life forever!

Titus 1:5-9,"('Pastor', 'Ordination', 'Elders Responsibiliy')",Baptist," Biblical Expectations Of An Elder Titus 1:5-9 Thom Rainer president of LifeWay Christian stores recently asked a few hundred laypersons to write down what they desired of a pastor. He shares some of the top responses that he received: People desire a Pastor who possessed love of congregation, they want a man who was an effective preacher, a man with strong character and a good work ethic, someone who casts a vision and demonstrates healthy leadership. They desire a leader who is joyous and transparent, also someone who does not yield to critics and finally people said that they want a pastor who models evangelism. (source:http://thomrainer.com/2013/01/ten-things-church-members-desire-in-a-pastor/) I would not disagree with any of those responses. However there are some church members who have unrealistic expectations of their pastor. Rainer did another survey of deacons and asked what they expected from their pastor. In order to meet the minimum expectations of those deacons a pastor would have to fulfill the following responsibilities each week: - Prayer at the church: 14 hours - Sermon preparation: 18 hours - Outreach and evangelism: 10 hours - Counseling: 10 hours - Hospital and home visits: 15 hours - Administrative functions: 18 hours - Community involvement: 5 hours - Denominational involvement: 5 hours - Church meetings: 5 hours - Worship services/preaching: 4 hours - Other: 10 hours That is a total of 114 hours/week. This would require a pastor to work more than 16 hours a day for seven days a week. There are many different expectations that people have of their church leaders. But more important than pleasing the church members, the pastor should seek to please the Lord. God has outlined what He expects from a Pastor in the Bible. Our selected text is one of the most descriptive passages in the scriptures concerning the pastor's job description. I would like to walk through these verses and examine the ""Biblical Expectations Of An Elder"". Here in Titus, Paul uses the terms Elder & Bishop. There are 3 terms used interchangeably in scripture to refer to the same office...Elder (presbuteros) Bishop (episkopos) Pastor (poiman). When you read the qualifications set forth in scripture, God emphasizes the importance of personal character and theological competency. With that being said let's see what God expects from those who He has called to shepherd the flock. In verse 5 Paul charges Titus with the task of setting things in order. One of his responsibilities was to ordain elders in each city. Paul goes into detail describing the qualities and requirements of those elders. This sets up a contrast concerning those ""unruly, vain talkers and deceivers"" that are described in verses 10-16. When you look at the qualifications of an elder it is clear that faithfulness is paramount. - In these 5 verses there are 5 areas in which a pastor must be found faithful. Look with me to verse 5 as we see that: I. An Elder Must Be Faithful To The Church - v5 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:"
Titus 1:10-16,"('Church Conflict', 'Church Discipline', 'Sowing Discord')",Baptist," Problems In The Church That Must Be Stopped Titus 1:10-16 Jesus is patient, forgiving, compassionate and merciful and for that we are thankful. But scripture proves that there are some things that He will not tolerate. In John Chapter 2, as the Passover drew nigh, Jesus and His disciples went to Jerusalem. Upon arriving at the Temple Jesus found some men selling animals and money changers in the Temple. This infuriated the Savior and He made a whip of small chords and drove these people form the Temple. He poured out the coins of the money changers and threw over their tables. He said ""take these things away!"" ...""make not my Father's house a house of merchandise"". Jesus made it clear that there were some things that are not to be tolerated in the Father's House. Since the foundation of the church, there have been certain individuals who have caused great trouble. There are some who would love nothing more than to see the church destroyed. Others want complete control and will cause great turmoil when they don't get their way. Some work against the plan of God and seek to mold the church into their own likeness. One of the greatest problems throughout church history is the rise of false prophets. Jesus knew that this would be an issue. He warned us of this in Matthew 7:15, ""Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves."" Almost 2,000 years later the troublemakers in the church are still with us. Here in Titus 1:10-16 Paul focuses on rebuke and confrontation of those troublemakers. In the previous passage Paul instructs Titus to ""ordain Elders in each city"". He also reveals to Titus that he is in Crete to ""set things in order"". In verses 5-9 Paul describes the qualification of faithful ministers who serve the Savior. Here in verses 10-16 Paul now addresses the troublemakers who need to be stopped immediately. These types of people are still in the church today. They cannot be avoided or ignored... they must be confronted and stopped. We need to know who and what needs to be stopped as well as how to stop them. Fortunately the answers are found in our selected text. I would like examine these verses and preach on the thought... ""Problems In The Church That Must Be Stopped"". - The first of those problems that I would like to consider is: I. The Infiltration In The Church That Must Be Stopped To ""infiltrate"" is to enter or gain access to (an organization, place, etc.) covertly and gradually, in order to acquire secret information. The FBI has brought down organized crime families, gangs, and other groups by sending in agents to ""infiltrate"" these organizations and gain valuable information. Satan does the same thing with false prophets, he will use these individuals to infiltrate the church and cause as much harm as possible. And they have been very successful. Consider if you will: A. The Position They Hold - v10a ""For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision"""
Ephesians 1:7-12,"('Wisdom And Understanding', 'Predestined')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 12/21/16 Lesson 3: The Son Redeemed Believers in the Historical Past (1:7-12) Series: Paul's letter to the Ephesians Ephesians 1:7-12 (NIV) 7 In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace 8 that he lavished on us. With all wisdom and understanding, 9 he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ, 10 to be put into effect when the times reach their fulfillment--to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ. 11 In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will, 12 in order that we, who were the first to put our hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory. Introduction Ephesians chapter 1 contains one of the most amazing sentences ever penned in any language. It is like a waterfall pouring from the lips of Paul as he tries to express the wonderful privileges of being a Christian. Its great theme is God's grace. The riches of this grace have been lavished on us in Christ. They lead us, at last, to live ""for the praise of His Glory"" (1:12). But here Paul takes us to the epicenter of God's plan and sets everything else He said in its ultimate context. God has lavished His grace on us in all wisdom and understanding (1:8). Why should that be needed? The answer is breathtaking: in Jesus Christ, God has made known ""the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Christ, to be put into effect when the times reach their fulfillment"" (9-10). God plans to bring this fallen world, governed by apparently random and sometimes, chaotic events and disruptions in nature and human life, into a unified cosmos over which Jesus Christ will be King. In fact Christ's reign has already begun. He has already ushered in the kingdom of God. For the moment that kingdom seems small and undistinguished--like a mustard seed (Mark 4:31). But it will expand to fill the whole earth. The day will come, Paul believes, when every knee will bow before Christ and every tongue confess that He is Lord (Philippians 2:10-11), either because they love Him or because they fear His power. On that day ""the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat, and the calf and the lion and the fatted calf together, and a little child shall lead them . . . the weaning child shall put his hand on the adders den . . . for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea"" (Isaiah 11:6-9). Commentary ""Redemption"" and ""the forgiveness of sins (trespasses)"" are joined together in such a way as to suggest the closest possible relation, but they are not identical concepts. ""Redemption"" denotes a release brought about by the payment of a price. In every case, the conception is the delivering or the setting free of a man from a situation from which he himself was powerless to liberate himself, or from a penalty which he himself could never have paid. Men knew the wrongness of the life they were living; and also that they were powerless to do anything about it. They needed liberation. It was just that liberation that Jesus Christ brought. It is still true that He can liberate men from helpless slavery to the things that attract and disgust them at one and the same time. In simple terms, Jesus can still make bad men good."
Matthew 10:5-15,"('Training', 'Students', 'Training Disciples', 'Apprentices')",Baptist," Introduction A. The interviewer examined the job application then turned to the prospective employee. ""I see you have put ASAP down for the date you are available to start, meaning as soon as possible, of course. However, I see you've put AMAP down for required salary. I don't believe I've ever seen that before, what does it mean?"" The applicant replied, ""As Much as Possible!"" B. Last week we began looking at this passage 1. The one significant thing to see is that Jesus sent the twelve to the lost sheep of Israel a. If we were to take our commission from this passage we would be limited to evangelizing Jews b. So this passage is not for us to use as our commission c. However God recorded this for our edification d. And there are principles for us to glean for our missions C. Initially, Jesus called His disciple to be with Him 1. We saw the Apostles apprenticeship a. First they were students b. Then sent as apprentices 2. Then we saw Jesus motive a. He saw the multitude and was moved with compassion for them (1) Jesus loved the wandering, struggling, masses (2) And Jesus was moved to begin this training mission because of their inevitable judgment 3. Then we saw that these twelve guys had a divine commission a. The apostles were called by Jesus Christ, God incarnate, in His sovereignty b. They weren't just looking for a job c. They didn't volunteer, they were called and commissioned by the Lord d. For a few weeks the apostles were official ambassadors of Christ 4. We also saw that older, more experienced people of God hold out three criteria by which we can know how genuine our calling is a. First is a strong desire to enter ministry b. Second is the confirmation from the church c. And third, is the presence of an open door D. And now we will examine the rest of our passage 1. Lets turn to Matthew 10:5 II. Body A. The Command of Christ Matthew 10:5 NKJV These twelve Jesus sent out and commanded them, saying: ""Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter a city of the Samaritans. 1. According to Matthew 10:5, Jesus not only sent the disciples but also commanded them a. It would seem that the concept of command would need little or no explanation, however the word has a larger context (1) So lets take a moment to look into this matter of command (a) The first idea we are very familiar with is the military context i) There was a class of West Point cadets that were in the field studying an antenna. The instructor asked the class how many commands would it take to erect the antenna. The guesses ranged over 10 to 50 commands, but one cadet said it would take only one order. The instructor asked what that order might be and the cadet answered, ""sergeant, get this antenna put up."" (b) There is the legal sense i) Legal in the context of a summons to appear in court a) A summons to jury duty b) A summons to appear as a witness c) Or a summons to appear as a defendant (c) There is the ethical sense i) When you learn what is ethically right, you are bound to obey it"
Matthew 10:24-33,"('Persecution', 'Fear Not', 'Expect Persecution', 'Expect Injustice', 'God Sees All')",Baptist," I. Introduction A. We live in a small town where we have a volunteer Ambulance Corp. We are blessed with many dedicated and fully qualified attendants, who staff our ambulances and give freely of themselves. I was chatting with one of the EMS responders one day and she could hardly stifle a chuckle, so I asked her what was so funny and she told me this story... 1. It seems that she had gone to an automobile accident and was checking a patient who was lying on the road for injuries. As she knelt beside him and probed him, she asked, ""Does this hurt or does that hurt?"" After each probe, he replied, ""No."" When she had nearly completed her examination, she shifted to a better spot from which to finish the examination when after one of her probing questions, he exclaimed very loudly, ""That hurts!"" 2. When she asked where, he looked up at her with a look of real pain on his face and said, ""Your kneeling on my fingers!"" B. We are continuing to examine the passage here that we started last Sunday 1. Jesus in His instructions to His Apostles brought up these things a. Christ said three times, ""Fear not"" in verse 26, 28, 31 b. He was encouraging His disciples not to fear persecution c. They must expect persecution, for He Himself was persecuted C. This section of Scripture may be out lined like this 1. First, there is the fact of persecution (v.24-25). 2. Then we are admonished not fear persecutors (v.26-27) 3. Then do not fear men who kill the body (v.28) 4. Then do not fear, for God cares, supremely so (v.29-31) 5. And the conclusion to all this is loyalty is essential (v.32-33) a. We turn again to Matthew 10:28 II. Body A. Do not fear mortal men who can only maim and kill the body Matthew 10:28 (NKJV) ""And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. 1. This little bit of humor comes from Dr. George Sweeting, at one time, President of Moody Bible Institute: Dr. Sweeting tells of the day he noticed an unusual combination of bumper stickers on the car of a man who was visiting the school. The coincidental message conveyed by the two stickers prompted Dr. Sweeting to suggest to the unsuspecting visitor that he might want to remove one of them. One read: JESUS IS COMING! and the other: ESCAPE TO WISCONSIN. What no wrath in Wisconsin? a. Turn to 2 Timothy 4:2 2. We are to be too busy to worry about people who can only kill the body 2 Timothy 4:2 (NKJV) Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching. 3. The second word of encouragement is this: do not fear men who kill the body. a. We are not to fear humans, but to fear God (1) Turn to 2 Corinthians 5:8 b. The reason is simple and understandable: men can kill only the body; God can destroy both body and soul ""in hell"" c. There are several reasons why men are not to be feared (1) Men can kill only the body, not the soul (a) Their power is limited and they can go no further (b) They cannot touch a person's soul, a person's real being"
Matthew 10:34-42,"('Death', 'Endure', 'God In The Hardships', 'Hardships')",Baptist," Introduction A. Last week we began looking at this passage and we found that in this passage Jesus lays some heavy demands upon His disciples 1. He stated clearly what it will cost a person to be His disciple, and He describes the cost by using these four illustrations 2. The passage can be outlined this way a. For background we have Jesus' purpose (v.34) b. First illustration : a person's family (v.35-37) c. Second illustration: the cross (v.38) d. Third illustration: a person's life (v.39) e. Fourth illustration: welcoming and ministering to others (v.40-42) 3. We covered the first illustration, a. That a Christian's family might turn against them b. We started to look at the second illustration in Matthew 10:38 II. Body A. Take up our cross and follow Jesus Matthew 10:38 (NKJV) And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me. 1. We are going to turn to a number of passages very quickly concerning the cross the individual is to carry a. Second is Matthew 16:24 Matthew 16:24 (NKJV) Then Jesus said to His disciples, ""If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. (1) Take note that Jesus said, let him deny himself and take up his cross, and follow Me (2) The concept of the cross was the concept of death (a) Death (b) Humiliation (c) And degradation i) Turn to Galatians 2:20 (3) The idea being death to self but living for Christ (a) Paul expressed this very well in Galatians 2:20 Galatians 2:20 (NKJV) I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. (b) As we take up our cross we are crucified with Christ i) Jesus is our sustainer ii) Our source of strength iii) Our master (c) We are to die to self in order to live for Christ b. Third is Mark 10:21 Mark 10:21 (NKJV) Then Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, ""One thing you lack: Go your way, sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross, and follow Me."" (1) Notice Jesus words to the rich young ruler (a) Give up the things of this world (b) And your reward in heaven will be great (c) Die to self, deny self, take up your cross and follow me (2) The world must be left behind (a) Does this mean we have to give away everything? i) No. ii) Jesus was telling the rich young ruler to give up those things which stand between you and God iii) Things which in and of themselves may be good or at least not evil, if they block pour way to complete, total dedication to Christ must be eliminated a) Now lets turn to Matthew 10:39 B. We move on to the third illustration which is that of a person's life Matthew 10:39 (NKJV) He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake will find it. 1. Jesus demands a person's life a. When Jesus says ""He who finds his life will lose it b. What does that mean, ""Finds his life?"" c. ""Finds his life"", means that a person seeks his own pleasure and passions in this earthly life"
Matthew 22:1-46,"('Confrontation', 'Greatest Commandment')",Baptist," 1. Confrontation over authority. Jesus questioned why the Jews did not follow John the Baptist. ""If we say, 'from heaven,' He will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?' But if we say . . . 'from men' . . . they feared the people"" (Mark 11:31-32). Parable of farmer with two sons (Matthew 21:28-32) FIRST SON SECOND SON NO said yes WENT Didn't go SINNERS WHO REPENT sinners who don't repent Parable of absentee landlord (Matt. 21:33-41) Parable of wedding feast (Matt. 22:1-14) 2. Confrontation over compromise (Matthew 22:15-22). a. The Herodians, who were accused of compromising with Rome, brought Jesus a coin. ""Whose image . . . ?"" (Matthew 22:20). b. ""Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesars', and to God the things that are God's"" (Matthew 22:21). 3. Confrontation over the resurrection (Matthew 22:23-33). a. The Sadducees presented Jesus with a ""stock"" argument against the resurrection. ""Whose wife shall she be in the resurrection?"" (v. 28). b. Jesus addressed the larger problem and accused them of being ignorant of the Scriptures. He argued the resurrection from a verb tense (Exodus 3:6, 15). ""I am"" rather than ""I was"". ""I am the God of Abraham . . . God is not the God of the dead, but of the living"" (Matthew 22:32). 4. Confrontation over the greatest commandment (Matthew 22:34-40). a. A lawyer asked, ""Which is the great commandment?"" (v. 36). b. ""You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind"" (v. 37). 5. Jesus questioned His accusers (Matthew 22:41-46). a. ""What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is He?"" (v. 42). b. They answered, ""The Son of David"" (v. 42). c. ""How then does David in the Spirit call Him 'Lord'?"" (v. 43). 6. The Olivet Discourse (Matthew 24, 25). A sermon on the Second Coming will be discussed later. If you have never really accepted Jesus as your personal Savior, would you do it right now? Do not delay or put it off. If you would like to receive Christ by faith, pray this simple prayer in your heart: Dear Lord, I acknowledge that I am a sinner. I believe Jesus died for my sins on the cross, and rose again the third day. I repent of my sins. By faith I receive the Lord Jesus as my Savior. You promised to save me, and I believe You, because You are God and cannot lie. I believe right now that the Lord Jesus is my personal Savior, and that all my sins are forgiven through His precious blood. I thank You, dear Lord, for saving me. In Jesus' name, Amen. If you prayed that prayer, God heard you and saved you. I personally want to welcome you to the family of God and rejoice with you. All PBC lessons are available online at trbc.org/pbc.

Luke 21:1-4,"('Stewardship', ""Widow's Mite"")",Baptist," A. INTRODUCTION ""While Jesus was in the Temple, he watched the rich people dropping their gifts in the collection box. Then a poor widow came by and dropped in two small coins. 'I tell you the truth,' Jesus said, 'this poor widow has given more than all the rest of them. For they have given a tiny part of their surplus, but she, poor as she is, has given everything she has'"" (Luke 21:1-4, NLT). 1. God delights to use small things so His glory is seen. a. Humility: ""When you were little in your own sight"" (1 Sam. 15:17). b. Possessions/things: ""Better is a little with the fear of the Lord"" (Prov. 15:16). c. Progress/time: ""By little and little I will drive them out"" (Ex. 23:30). ""Line upon line, here a little, there a little"" (Isa. 28:10). d. Future: ""Again a little while, and you will not see Me"" (John 16:16). 2. God unexpectedly uses little things. a. Little reputation. Prisoner Joseph saved the world from starvation. b. Little army. Gideon was told twice to go small, (1) go home, (2) chase those who lapped water, i.e., 300 men. c. Little weapons. Goliath had a spear and a sword. But David had 5 smooth stones. d. Little physical talent. Moses stuttered. e. Little place, insignificant location. ""Thou Bethlehem . . . you were little among the earth"" (Micah 5:2). 3. The widow's mite was an enormous gift to heaven and God. a. The example principle. Millions have read her example and have given multiple millions. b. The investment principle. She sacrificed all into God's treasury, and she enjoys multiple blessings in heaven. c. The faith principle. When someone with a little gift gives it sacrificially to God, He blessed what is left over and beyond that He supplies for their need in the future. 4. The stewardship principle. ""Stewardship is properly managing your time, talent and treasures for the glory of God. 5. The eternity principle. The widow was not emphasizing life on this earth, but looked forward to rewards in heaven. 6. The happiness principle. The widow gave all that she had and was happy with nothing. Ask yourself, ""Does money make me happy?"" 7. Illustrations of how God expands little gifts to Him. a. The sword: young John Ring died saving Captain Russell Cornwell's sword and it led to Cornwell's conversion. It is embedded in the chapel wall at Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. b. The red purse of Hattie Mae Wyatt held 57 cents when she died. Those 57 pennies sold for $250.00 (54 of 57 returned). Down payment 57 cents in Baptist Temple. c. The Emma Hill gold dollar was given to missionary John McCullough at Second Presbyterian Church, Nashville, Tennessee. It was the last gift to her as her father died. She said, ""See that Jesus gets it."" He held it up to my $17,000 to plant a church. It was displayed for 100 years at the American Sunday School Mission headquarters. If you have never really accepted Jesus as your personal Savior, would you do it right now? Do not delay or put it off. If you would like to receive Christ by faith, pray this simple prayer in your heart:"
John 14:1,"('Unbelief', 'Relationship')",Baptist," A. INTRODUCTION 1. The first question was asked by Peter. ""Lord, where are You going?"" (John 13:36). Answer: ""In My Father's house are many mansions . . . I go to prepare a place for you"" (John 14:2). ""Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me"" (v. 1). a. Jesus is concerned about your mental troubles, because unbelief is their source. b. The primary source of our trouble is our heart, it is our personality, i.e., (1) Intellect/thinking. (2) Emotion/feeling. (3) Will/choice. 2. Our primary instinct and obligation is ""belief in God."" a. Believe He exists. b. Believe He created us (Rom. 1:18-21). c. Believe in right and wrong (Rom. 2:15-16). 3. A second question was asked by Thomas. "". . . how can we know the way?"" (John 14:5). Answer: ""I am the way . . . to the Father . . ."" (John 14:6). a. The way to heaven is by a relationship to Jesus. (1) Not correct doctrine. (2) Not church ordination. (3) Not good works. (4) Not sincerity. b. The way of Jesus is narrow, not broad. ""Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many who go in by it. Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it"" (Matt. 7:13-14). c. We can have confidence in the ""TRUTH"" of Jesus. Truth is that which is consistent with itself, and corresponds to the laws of nature. d. There are two aspects to Jesus' life: (1) Length, eternal without end. (2) Quality, life more abundant (John 10:10). e. Negation. (1) Is there another way to heaven apart from Jesus? No! (2) Will God give a second chance after death? No! 4. A third request was made by Philip. ""Lord, show us the Father"" (John 14:8), i.e., what does the Father look like? Answer: ""He who has seen Me has seen the Father"" (John 14:9). 5. A fourth question was asked by Judas (not Iscariot). ""Lord, how is it that you will manifest Yourself to us, and not to the world?"" (John 14:22). Answer: a. Seen through fellowship with Son and the Father. ""Jesus answered and said to him, 'If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him'"" (John 14:23). b. By the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. ""But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you"" (John 14:26). c. By inner peace. ""Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you . . ."" (John 14:27). If you have never really accepted Jesus as your personal Savior, would you do it right now? Do not delay or put it off. If you would like to receive Christ by faith, pray this simple prayer in your heart: Dear Lord, I acknowledge that I am a sinner. I believe Jesus died for my sins on the cross, and rose again the third day. I repent of my sins. By faith I receive the Lord Jesus as my Savior. You promised to save me, and I believe You, because You are God and cannot lie. I believe right now that the Lord Jesus is my personal Savior, and that all my sins are forgiven through His precious blood. I thank You, dear Lord, for saving me. In Jesus' name, Amen."

Early that morning he had an opportunity to walk through some of the famous rose gardens when the full fragrance of the flowers filled the air. Later, he arrived at the hotel where a Bible conference was being held. As he took his seat, a man turned to him and said, ""Dr. Weigle, I know where you've been. You toured one of our lovely gardens, for I can smell the pleasing aroma on your clothing."" Weigle then said, ""My prayer is that I may walk so closely with the Lord that the fragrance of His grace will pervade my being. I want them to know by my words, actions, and songs that I have been with Jesus."" That's the way it will be if we truly walk with Him. The sweet smell of His life will be seen by others. 1.

Some return to their old ways in backsliding. ""I am going fishing"" (John 21:3). ""My people are bent on backsliding from Me"" (Hosea 11:7). 4. Sometimes we don't realize when Christ is calling us. ""Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me"" (Rev. 3:20). 5. Christ asks questions to get us thinking about our future? ""I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing"" (John 15:5). 6. We do impetuous things when we encounter Christ. ""And Peter answered Him and said, 'Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.' So He said, 'Come.' And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus"" (Matt. 14:28-29). 7. We do extraordinary things when we are excited about Christ. ""I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me"" (Phil. 4:13). 8. We must serve Christ with our talents, even though He could perform our task without us. ""We then, as workers together with Him"" (2 Cor. 6:1)."
Exodus 33:7-11,"('Jesus', 'Prayer', 'Devotional Life', 'Intimacy Of Prayer')",Assembly Of God,xodus 33:7-," Stay in the Tent! CCCAG February 12th, 2017 Intro In my early days of being a Christian, I was working in an electronics factory. Tammie and I had been arguing over something that morning when she got home from work after closing the restaurant she managed, and I left for work angry. At that time, I was getting a ride to work from a coworker as we didn't have a car, and I lived about 8 miles away from my job. As I sat on the assembly line, I was fuming over the fight. Usually, I didn't let things get under my skin, but Tammie was driving me crazy about this and my mind kept playing the argument over and over again in my head thinking of better ways of winning the fight. I kept feeling God knocking on the door of my heart, but I kept ignoring it and letting the anger fuel my rage at the situation until my lead came over and ask me what was wrong. He said it was like a dark cloud was hanging over my head and I looked like I was ready to kill someone. I blew him off a bit saying I didn't want to talk about it. That insistent knocking of Jesus on my heart grew louder, and harder, and actually was quite irritating. Has anyone ever been there- Jesus is knocking, and you just want HIM to go away and leave you alone so you can wallow in whatever situation HE's trying to get you out of? As I kept trying to ignore the prompting of the LORD, I felt an almost suffocating weight descending on me- much like what people who have anxiety have described what they feel- but I don't suffer anxiety. I'm German and Norwegian...we don't feel fear? (Joke) As this weight kept pressing on me, the current job on that line ended. There was a parts delay of a few hours on the next job, and there wasn't much else for us to do so my boss came up to me and told me I could go home if I wanted. The problem was- my ride was on another line that would be working for several more hours, and no one else was going my way. So I walked home. Over 8 miles. In January. That's like walking from here to Pigeon Falls, and half of that walk would be in the county, all alone in the fields before I hit the city limits. It was the best thing I could have done. Getting alone, quiet, and away from the noise of life where I could hear God's voice again and humble myself before HIM and turn from my stubbornness. I've always remembered that time, and I try to do the same thing now- when life gets too busy, the noise of life is too loud, or the demands get too heavy and seem insurmountable- I go away. I walk in the woods, go for a long drive, get alone by myself so I can quiet my spirit and hear from God. There are tons of scriptural examples of this, so let's look at one of them- (David, John the Baptist, Jesus) Moses is the first to model that for us in the bible. (from our reading) Ex 33:7-11 Now Moses used to take a tent and pitch it outside the camp some distance away, calling it the ""tent of meeting."" Anyone inquiring of the LORD would go to the tent of meeting outside the camp. And whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people rose and stood at the entrances to their tents, watching Moses until he entered the tent. As Moses went into the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and stay at the entrance, while the LORD spoke with Moses. Whenever the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent, they all stood and worshiped, each at the entrance to their tent. The LORD would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his young aide Joshua son of Nun did not leave the tent."
Galatians 5:13-21,"('Jealousy',)",Presbyterian/Reformed," Judge Your Jealousy Habits of Happiness Part 3 Galatians 5:13-21 We all want to be happy. I bet there is no single person who intentionally chooses to be unhappy. However, so many people in this world are not happy for one reason or another. In order to be happy, this is what we have to realize. Happiness is our choice. Happiness is something that we choose. In order to be happy, we must do things that will bring happiness. However, there are many who are not happy. It is partly because of the way they think, the way they talk, and the way they act does not make them happy. When people think negatively, talk critically, and act unbiblically, these are not something that they acquired overnight. They are habits that they have built. Therefore, in order to be happy, we must change the way we think, talk, and act. We must build habits of thinking, talking, and acting biblically. And we can form these habits by repeatedly doing them. And today we will talk about the importance of judging our jealousy. Why is it so important for us to overcome jealousy in order to be happy? It is because jealousy leads to loneliness. The Bible tells us to rejoice with those who rejoice and to mourn with those who mourn (Romans 12:15). People who are consumed with jealously do just the opposite. They rejoice when others mourn and they mourn when others rejoice. In that way, jealousy is the loneliest of all vices. It isolates us because everyone becomes our competitor. It forces us to focus inward and makes us selfish. When we become free from jealousy, we can be healthy and happy. But every time we give in to jealousy, we move toward a never-ending cycle of comparison and unhappiness. Look at the place where we work. There are so much office politics and power struggles. One division competes with another division. One worker envies the other worker. A whole company can be poisoned by jealousy. What about the coworker who has an office down from you? Is there jealous between you over salary or position? Look at some churches. Members fight to be recognized. Pastors fight over popularity. Look at some parents. Parents become jealous when other kids do better than their kids. If you do not believe me, go to some sport games and see how some parents behave. Look at some families. Jealousy seek to destroy the families. It all began with Cain's jealousy over Abel. We saw the jealousy between Jacob and Esau. In the New Testament, there is the older brother in the story of the Prodigal son. And we see the disciples fighting over the superior position. Jealousy is in every area of our lives. However, unless we learn to overcome our feelings of jealousy, we can never be truly happy. Then how can we overcome jealousy? Paul gave us these three antidotes against jealousy. I. We must renounce jealousy as sin (vv. 15, 19-21). Verses 19-21 say this. 19 The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; 20 idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions 21 and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God."
John 3:3,"('Born Again', 'Kingdom Of God')",Foursquare," The Kingdom of God ""A New Birth Required"" John 3:3 Without controversy the greatest need of the human race is to come back into the Kingdom of God; to come back into and under the rule and reign of God, which humanity left back at the Garden of Eden with the sin of Adam and Eve. It is with this understanding of life's greatest need that finds people drawn to one of the best-known stories of the New Testament and the gospel accounts. It is Jesus' encounter with the Pharisee Nicodemus. Nicodemus is a teacher of Jewish law and religion, and he comes in the middle of the night to seek and interview with Jesus. Now, in rabbinical thinking, Jesus was not really an official teacher of the law, yet he was teaching and preaching about the Kingdom of God, working miracles wherever he went, and the common man and woman were gathering to Him, along with religious leaders to witness this phenomena. And so it was that one evening Nicodemus comes to Jesus seeking this most basic and fundamental need to humanity. And Jesus' response puts the whole thing about entrance into the Kingdom of God more clearly and distinctly than at any other time. ""Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."" (John 3:3 NKJV) What I find interesting about Jesus' response is that He never allowed Nicodemus to finish his thought or ask the question that was so near and dear to his heart. He only got as far as stating what he thought of Jesus and his ministry, and how Jesus was not only a teacher of the law but how God was with Him as well. Jesus suddenly interrupts Nicodemus and answers his question even before he asked it. Notice it says Jesus answered. Answered what? Nicodemus never asked. Jesus interrupts because He's teaching Nicodemus and all of us one of the most profound truths about the Kingdom of God; how it can be entered. And the reason Jesus interrupted is because He didn't have to hear the question; He already knew what was in Nicodemus' heart. There's a perfect illustration found earlier. ""But Jesus did not commit Himself to them, because He knew all men, and had no need that anyone should testify of man, for He knew what was in man."" (John 2:24-25 NKJV) Jesus didn't have to wait for Nicodemus' question, because He already knew it. Why didn't Jesus wait? It may have been because as an instructor of Jewish religion and law he may have been embarrassed because it should have been something he knew. And it's no different with us. When we come near to Jesus through reading His word and prayer we need to come with our hearts wide open to meet with Him and ask, ""Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me, and know my anxieties; and see if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting."" (Psalm 23:24 NKJV) If this is our prayer then Jesus will meet with us, search our hearts, and tells us all about ourselves, even those things we're afraid to ask. Jesus will interrupt our carefully laid out speeches, thoughts, ideas, and rationalizations. He will read us like an open book, because nothing can be concealed from Him. He tears away our camouflage and makeup and shows us as we truly are."
Philippians 2:12-13,"('Change', 'Repentance', 'The Holy Spirit', 'The Bible')",Foursquare," Change We Can Believe In Philippians 2:12-13 Change is a word that seems to be bandied around quite a bit. It's a word that for whatever reason seems to be in vogue. In politics ""change"" is a buzzword, like Barack Obama's initial campaign slogan, ""Change we can believe in."" People are always changing. They're moving towards healthier lifestyles, like changing their eating habits, from pizza to salads, or from sitting on the couch watching TV to working out while watching TV. People are also making changes in the way they appear. A change of wardrobe is seen as a way to build a person self esteem. Books from the 80's talked about how people could dress for success, and now we have personal shoppers who will match a person's wardrobe to fit their body type, personality, and career. People also talk about our need to change the way we think. Tolerance is the buzzword of our day, but we've changed the way we view it. It used to be that differences were tolerated and people were free to disagree and discuss their differences. Now tolerance has changed to intolerance because we're no longer free to disagree. The Bible also talks about the desperate need for humanity to change before it's too late. ""Cast away from you all the transgressions which you have committed, and get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. For why should you die ... Therefore turn and live!"" (Ezekiel 18:31-32 NKJV) God's desire is for there to be a change in the way we live so that there can be a change in where we spend eternity, and that change is called repentance. And so today I'd like to talk about a change that we truly can believe in. As believers we talk about how God has changed our lives. But how does God do that? Does He change our minds, does He do some closed heart surgery, or does He zap our spirits to change us. There's also a lot of conflicting advice. We hear people tout our need to wait upon the Lord, while others say, ""If it's meant to be it's up to me."" So how do we facilitate change? Is it our responsibility, God's, or a combination of both? The Apostle Paul deals with this issue. It's found in his letter to the Philippian church. And what we see is that both God and ourselves have a part to play. ""Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure."" (Philippians 2:12-13 NKJV) Underline ""work out,"" and ""work in."" To work out is our part, while to work in is God's, and what Paul is saying is that we're to work out, that is, to develop what God is working in. Notice Paul didn't tell us to ""work for"" our salvation. Instead he said to work it out. It's important to understand we're not to work for our salvation, which Paul makes clear. ""For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast."" (Ephesians 2:8-9 NKJV)"
Colossians 1:18-20,"('Reconciliation', 'Supremacy Of Christ')",Independent/Bible," ""A Hymn to the Supremacy of Christ In Redemption"" Colossians 1:18-20 Last week we looked at the first section of this marvelous Hymn to the Supremacy of Christ found in Colossians 1:15-20 and saw that it declares Christ as the Eternal Creator and Sustainer God, who has the highest rank or priority in the entire universe. He is God who holds all things together. Christ shares the Godly supremacy over the entire Created order! This week we will look at verses 18-20 but we will read Colossians 1:15-20: ""He (that is Jesus Christ) is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation."" (not born but the highest rank and authority, all the privileges which would be awarded a firstborn. Jesus could not be a born creature and be the Creator of all things at the same time.) 16 ""For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers."" (Remember that the false doctrine which was prevalent at the time was the belief of a hierarchy of angels in which people said that you should pray to angels. This section refutes that understanding. Angels were created by God too and they are subject to Christ.) ""All things were created through Him and for Him. 17 And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist."" Now to the second half in verse18: ""And He is the head of the body, the Church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence. 19 For it pleased the Father that in Him all the fullness should dwell, 20 and by Him to reconcile all things to Himself, by Him, whether things on earth or things in heaven, having made peace through the blood of His cross."" Jesus is Supreme over Redemption In verses 15-17 we saw Jesus' pre-eminence, that is, His prominence and superiority in the entire realm of Creation; in verses 18-20 we see Jesus' equal sovereignty in the realm of Redemption: Jesus is Lord over all. Verses 13-14 were the direct prelude to this Hymn and describe ""WHY"" the Lord Jesus Christ is Supreme over Redemption; Look at those again: 13 ""He (God the Father) has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, 14 in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins."" (God has picked us up from one place, being dead in our sins, and transferred us into another, into the Kingdom of His Son.) Kingdom's have rulers or leaders and God is the ruler of His Kingdom; Verse 14 tells us that we have been placed into the Kingdom of God, or as verse 14 said, ""the Kingdom of His Son,"" so we can say that the Kingdom of God IS the Kingdom of His Son, and it implies clearly that Jesus shares in all of the power of the Godhead. That is why the beginning of verse 18 can state very clearly that ""He (Jesus, and Jesus alone) is the head of the body, the Church."" Jesus is the Head of the Body, the Church. In Paul's earlier writings (Gal., 1 & 2 Thess., 1 & 2 Cor. and Romans), he mentions that the Church is the ""Body"" of Christ. In Romans 12:5 Paul said: ""So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another."" 1 Corinthians 12:12-31 explains this concept in detail, explaining that believers are all part of the ONE Body of Christ, the Church, and that God gives each one of us gifts by which we contribute to the unity, oneness and health of the body and that no one is exempt. No gift is insignificant because all the body parts are essential to the well-being of the body. (If you lose a part of your own body or if a part is not functioning properly, you find out how much you miss it.)"
Colossians 1:21-23,"('Perseverance', 'True Faith', 'Perseverance In Faith', 'Reconciling Love')",Independent/Bible," ""A Reconciling Love and Resulting Character"" Colossians 1:21-23 We continue in our study of Colossians. Having studied the hymn of the early Church in Colossians 1:15-20 exalting Christ's supremacy over all Creation as well as redemption, we continue in verses 21-23: Col. 1:21: ""And you, who once were alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled 22 in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy, and blameless, and above reproach in His sight-- 23 if indeed you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you heard, which was preached to every creature under heaven, of which I, Paul, became a minister."" Sinful man is estranged from God After considering Christ's majestic role in Creation and Redemption, Paul comes down to earth, so to speak, and becomes personal again with the Colossians as well as with us, explaining that ""you (pl.)...were once alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works."" By nature, sinful man is estranged from God, and helpless to bridge the chasm. Ephesians 2:3 expresses that truth about us in our unsaved state: ""Among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the others."" We were filled with self-desire and deserving only of the wrath of God. God was ""a stranger"" to us and us to Him. Alienated"" carries with it the idea of being far off and shut out from fellowship and intimacy with God; before God worked in us, we were shut out from any intimacy with God. Ephesians 2:12-13 also states this fact clearly; before you were saved by grace, ""that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, (You had no clue about God's saving grace by faith in Christ.) having no hope and without God in the world.(You may have THOUGHT you had hope, but you did not because you were a stranger toward God.) Ephesians 4:18 uses this clause to describe our lost condition: ""18 having their understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart."" Being alienated from the Holy God by our own sin is a most desperate condition, and we were unable to move without the gracious help of God. Our text says we were ""Enemies in our mind""; This means that our thoughts and intents, our minds, our hearts and our wills, were so opposed to God that we were blinded and at war against God and the things of God. We were His enemies because our sin separated us from God and of ourselves we could not come to God. Our minds will always entertain what is in our hearts, and then played out in our actions. Our wicked deeds served as proof of our alienation and produced wicked works as the fruit of our lives. Our own works proved our sinful natures, which prohibited us from knowing, fellowshipping and loving God at all, let alone with all our heart, soul, mind and strength. While pondering that commandment to love God with all our being, Martin Luther once replied in honesty: ""Love God? Sometimes I hate Him."""

The explosion was massive, and the men told they had little hope but they worked with him until they turned the case over to the trauma team. One man and I stood at the door of the ER and waited for his wife. She speed her Mercedes in the ER doors and jumped out. The man waiting with me had blood all over him. We hugged the lady, she knew this was serious. She was crying and screaming. We took her into the little chapel and told her the doctor would soon be in to speak with her and that things were really bad. She started telling me her story. They got up at 4:30 am and he got ready for work and she would normally been making him breakfast and packing his lunch. They had a huge argument and they were fussing back and forth. She refused to pack his lunch and gave him no breakfast. As he walked out of the door she told him, she hated him and hoped he would die. The lady ask me if I could pray and bring him back just for a few minutes. She needed to talk to him and tell him how much she loved him. In tears, I just listened and held her. The Doctor came in the room and told her, YOUR HUSBAND IS DEAD AND THERE WAS NOTHING WE COULD DO TO SAVE HIM. She begged the doctor, PLEASE, GIVE ME 5 MINUTES WHERE HE CAN HEAR ME! I have a home in Florida I will give you for 5 minutes. The doctor hugged the woman and said: I AM SO SORRY, THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO. The doctor recommended the lady not to see her husband's body. SHE INSISTED, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND I HAVE TO SEE HIM."
Matthew 13:44-46,"('Salvation', 'Treasure', 'Redemption', 'Great Price', 'Treasure And Pearl')",Presbyterian/Reformed," A buried treasure and a pricy pearl Matthew 13:44-46 44 ""The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field. 45 ""Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. 46 When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it. Message: Last week we examined Jesus parable about the sower and the four kinds of soil. In that passage we discovered a statement that Jesus made concerning why He was speaking in parables to His disciples. That through this ""knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of Heaven"" regarding the parables we Seekers would receive something that other listeners would not. Matthew 13:11 We would know secrets or mysteries that could change our eternal address as future citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven. Not that we were more deserving but that our hearts, eyes and ears are open to the spiritual truths of God as shared by Messiah Jesus. Jesus explained this using the Old Testament book of Isaiah 6:9-10 that foretold that people would not be able to comprehend these things because of their calloused hearts. Now that we know how to discover these secrets let's see if we can unravel the parables in today's scripture passage. Both these parables are only two sentences long yet they shed light on many great eternal things. Have you ever had to disguise a secret to keep someone from discovering it too soon? Well the parables are in some way like that. They tell of something that you know is important but you can't quite figure it all out. The answers seem elusive. But those with open hearts, eyes and ears can know these things. You see friend our God has a plan to save the Nation of Israel and to save the whole world. That plan is dependent on Jesus. There are many factors involved in Jesus ministry and the timing of many, many things is very important. God does not want to expose His plan ahead of time to the enemy. So God the Father has his son Jesus speak in these parables. O.K. let's look at the parable of the hidden treasure in the field. Let's break it down. Jesus identifies the parts of the story; we have hidden treasure, we have a man, we have a field and we have a joyous discovery that causes the man to rebury the treasure and then sets out to buy the field. In our Bible Study group we identified the parts of the parable using our hearts and our heads. We also turned to some eminent Bible scholars to help put us on the right track. The parable we discovered is actually all about Jesus and His ministry to the nation of Israel. Dr. James MacDonald puts it this way... ""These two parables show that there will be two classes of righteous subjects in the Kingdom of Heaven. ""The treasure represents the godly remnant of believing Jews such as existed during Jesus earthly ministry and will exist again after the church is raptured. They are hidden in a field in that they are dispersed throughout the world and in a real sense unknown to any but God."""

OPPORTUNITY(:10b) Explanation:(:10b)Trust :10b--""And the people hurried & crossed;..."" God's people, Israel, had open opportunity to be His people in the land He had promised & is now giving them. The people ""hurried"" to cross the Jordan. Were they afraid of being the last ones in the path of the returning water? They may have been anxious to enter the next phase of their journey with God. Whether they were eager to serve God or themselves is not stated. My suspicion is that it was a little of both, given that at the end of the Conquest(24:14-15), Joshua called the people to choose whom they would serve--either gods(foreign/empty/powerless) or YHWH(known/overflowing/powerful). Christians are Positive Opportunists...To share as they are given opportunity. Anxiety can come with Completion(:10-11) of any task. It means that another anticipated but sometimes unanticipated phase is about to be entered. And that next phase requires change! It requires your looking at that change as an Opportunity. We must go where & when God wants us...courageously & gladly....Bearing the Good News in Jesus both in the church & to every place on the planet. We have to trust the One holding the water back. Yet NOT trust that He will 'hold the water back' specifically FOR US(our desire--that we might want it held back for our agenda)! Ps. 31:15--""My times are in Your hand; Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, And from those who persecute me."" Rev. 19:4-5--""And the twenty-four elders & the four living creatures fell down & worshiped God who sat on the throne, saying, ""Amen! Alleluia!"" Then a voice came from the throne, saying, ""Praise our God, all you His servants & those who fear Him, both small & great!"" Revelation details the 7-yr. period of man's final rule. We can follow the crowd who is trusting... ...the crowd 'can' be an example of 'rightly placed' trust, BUT they can also be examples of 'misplaced' trust. Therefore 'following the crowd' is always secondary to personal trust."
Luke 12:54-59,"(""God's Wrath"", 'Global Warming', 'Globalization', 'Time', 'Wrath Of God')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Before it's too Late Luke 12:54-59 New International Version (NIV) 54 He said to the crowd: ""When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, 'It's going to rain,' and it does. And when the south wind blows, you say, 'It's going to be hot,' and it is. Hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky. How is it that you don't know how to interpret this present time? ""Why don't you judge for yourselves what is right? As you are going with your adversary to the magistrate, try hard to be reconciled on the way, or your adversary may drag you off to the judge, and the judge turn you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison. I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny."" This past week my wife has been forced to sit in a chair while her foot heals from surgery. She has been incapacitated like this for nearly 3 weeks now. In this situation the days can run together and you lose track of just what day of the week it is. All you really know is that it's another day of healing and waiting, being unable to function at your normal range of abilities. Since I have been her principal caregiver during this time she has relied on me to keep her up to date on things. She had turned to me this week and asked a very simple question ""what day is it today""? To be perfectly honest I didn't know. I knew it was a weekday but I wasn't sure if it was a Tuesday or a Wednesday. We had both fallen into a routine that had made us both numb to the importance of time. We were unable to think beyond our own circumstances to consider what day we were living in. This is the same situation that the followers of Jesus found themselves in today's scripture passage. For many of them they had lost sight of the importance of the here and now and really did not give it a second thought. For them it was just another day. Another day of routine, another day of just existing instead of living. Sadly we can easily fall into just such a mind frame and forget to treasure the moment in which we are living. The Jewish people of Jesus time had just such an existence. They were God's Chosen people. They were the ones rescued from Egypt and set apart as a people of promise for God. They were witness to countless miracles on their journey to the Promised Land. They were given the Word of God and entrusted with the sacred scriptures and a series of covenants, special spiritual agreements that would forgive their sins and provided them with a spiritual legacy unlike any other. They had their Temple to worship in and a long established religious heritage but by the time that Jesus arrived they had fallen into a kind of spiritual numbness that led to complacency. For them it was just another day, another year, and they could not discern if it was any different from any other. It had been 400 years since the last prophet of God had spoken and nothing new had been written or recorded as scripture. Had God gone silent during this time or had they stopped listening?"
1 Peter 2:13-17,"('Freedom', 'Submission', 'Reverence', 'Governance')",Baptist," 'For The LORD'S SAKE'--1Peter 2:13--3:12 A. CHRISTIAN GOVERNANCE-&-Government--IV--1Peter 2:13-17 So far in our study of 1Peter we have examined the fact that Christians are...CONSIDERED ALIEN(1:1-2)... We've examined...WHAT's So GREAT About GOD--(1:3-12) Discovered God's means of...UNLEASHING Your SPIRITUAL VITALITY/Vigor--(1:13-21) And we've found the importance of LOVING THE BRETHREN(1:22--2:12). Now we are going to see how those truths play into the scheme of SUBMISSION...the give-&-take of relationships in our world. And particularly, the role Submission plays in the Christian's relationship with government. Attention: When I was a boy living at home, I was under the governance/tutelage of my parents. I did not 'rightly' do anything without their permission. I 'got away with' some things without their permission. But they were the governors of my life. Peter pressed the importance of Christian submission to secular governance. Peter expected the submission of Christians to secular governance. What is the relation between Christian obedience to secular governance? OR How are Christians to properly relate to secular governance? 6 facets of CHRISTIAN GOVERNANCE-&-Government. We've found previously that CHRISTIAN GOVERNANCE-&-Government addresses... 1. The SUBMISSION Of GOVERNANCE(:13a-c) 2. The REACH Of GOVERNANCE(:13d-14a) 3. The MISSION Of GOVERNANCE(:14b) 4. The SILENCE In GOVERNANCE(:15) 5--Christian Governance-&-Government addresses... FREEDOM In GOVERNANCE(:16) Explanation:(:16) 2:16--""as free, yet not using liberty as a cloak for vice, but as bondservants of God."" In following God thru His government, we act ""as free"" men do, because we are! Christians are free from--a.-Condemnation of sin, b.-(blind)Law, c.-Spiritual bondage, d.-Worldly influence, e.-Fear of man, f.-Fear of death, etc.! And true Christian freedom never uses ""liberty"" to ""cloak"" their ""vices."" In other words, Christian ""liberty"" is not God's liberty when it is used as a forceful wedge into the lives of others & when relied upon as a 'right' in order to meet selfish & fleshly ends. 'Vice-doing' evinces enslavement to sin & self. ""Genuine freedom liberates believers to do what is good.""--NAC Christians are instead to use their God-given liberty in the manner of ""bondservants of God."" 1Cor. 6:12--""All things are lawful for me, but all things are not helpful. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any."" 1Cor. 10:23-24--""All things are lawful for me, but not all things are helpful; all things are lawful for me, but not all things edify. Let no one seek his own, but each one the other's well-being.""... Similar to our 'All things in moderation'...In those verses Paul is re-casting 'secularized freedom' within the proper bounds of God's mercy & grace--so that His mercy & grace attain to being very practical as helpful, ministering, missional, building, encouraging, & loving. This same concept is present in Php. 2:1-11(in relation to Jesus' birth)... Php. 2:3-8--""Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself. Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others. Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, & coming in the likeness of men. And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself & became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross. You see, All things are only 'lawful,' if those 'things' are by 'the law of God', i.e. The perfect law of liberty(Js. 1:25; Js. 2:12)"
James 3:1-12,"('Gossip', 'Slander', 'Talebearers')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," The Sin of Gossip [Play video] Introduction: Whether its formal meetings, dinner table discussions, or late night phone calls; gossip has always been a problem in the church. I saw a cartoon from leadership magazine shows a line of pews and the same sentence being passed from pew to pew. 1st pew - the pastor said his ear kind of hurts. 2nd pew - the pastor has an earache. 3rd pew - The pastor got a hearing aid. 4th pew - the pastor is having trouble hearing. By the time it got to the last pew - An old lady with cane is walking out and says ""That does it, I'm outta here! - the pastor done went out and got a double earring!"" A rumor is like a snowball going downhill - the more it moves along the bigger it gets. There are times that what we say can do more harm than we intend. Gossip is easy to indulge in because it is hardly seen as a sin anyway. What exactly is a gossip? Webster defines gossip as both a noun and a verb. As a noun, a gossip is a person who habitually reveals personal or sensational facts. As a verb, gossip is a rumor or a report of an intimate nature. The sad reality of the matter is this: a gossip is a person who will talk about others with you and then turn around and talk to others about you. I believe the best definition of gossip is saying something, even if it is true, with the intent to cause personal harm. By that definition we are all guilty. The family member that is considered to be a dead beat the Co-worker is just plain lazy The person at church that gets on your nerves. Today we are going to focus on two key points about gossip from James 3:1-12 (read) let's first look into ... The Calamity of Gossip James says that no man can tame the tongue. This is what we call hyperbole - it is an exaggeration to make a point and in this case James makes the point that while it may be possible to tame the tongue it is something that is extremely difficult and yet there is no one who has kept it in check perfectly, which makes his statement divine truth - no matter how hard we work to tame it there will be a time when we say more than we should or we say something we shouldn't. One of the reasons that we need to get a handle on our words is because they are filled with great power. In fact, the tongue has the aggressive ability to destroy. Think about how many reputations have been ruined by careless words. When I work on gas pumps or oil tankers in my shed - I get paint and grease and oil on my jeans and it is difficult to get those stains out of my jeans, but at least I can get a different pair of jeans. But think about how difficult it is to get the dirt off a man's character once it is thrown on him. Once we are in someone's bad books we hardly ever get out of them. Ill. A senior in high school said that as an eighth grader she was the subject of an online rumor that she had slept with the football team. She said, ""I think it was started by the ex-girlfriend of a boy on the team. It didn't matter where it came from. People wanted to believe it. There was no way to refute it. I wanted to kill myself."" That's the pain and the devastation that can come from gossip. It's like a fire."
"Ephesians 5:31, Hebrews 12:15","('Bitterness', 'Bitter Words')",Independent/Bible," Introduction I want to thank Nick and Liz Corona for sharing their story with us. More than anything else, I want you to know that your past hurts do not have to control your future. If we believe anything about the Lord--we believe that he can give us hope for the future. And this includes becoming free from bitterness...like Nick and Liz experienced. Bitterness is a poison that can creep into any one of us...if we're not careful. About three years ago my mother-in-law passed away and we held her memorial service right here at Summit. Carolyn was loved by many and the service was a special experience. Her life was celebrated and God was honored. As far as any of us knew the events surrounding the memorial service went perfectly. As far as any of us knew the family was blessed and everyone went back home quite satisfied that Carolyn was honored in a beautiful and appropriate way. But unfortunately something had happened that no one was aware of. And it didn't come to light until several weeks ago. In late November Pam's sister was in San Diego and decided to stop by and visit Carolyn's last remaining brother. She had not seen her uncle since the memorial service. And since she was in the area she decided to stop in for a surprise visit. However, when Pam's sister rang the doorbell, her uncle opened the door and when he saw who it was he said matter-of-factly, ""You're not welcome her."" And then he closed the door. Pam's sister, of course, was mortified and wondered what in the world was going on. So she called her cousin, explained what happened and then asked if she had any idea what might have caused such an unexpected reaction. That's when Pam's sister found out for the first time that apparently something happened at Carolyn's memorial service three years ago that deeply offended her uncle...something that no one else knew about...but the offense took root in her uncle's heart and provoked him to cut off all communication with the extended family. Yet what happened at his door in November was the first time anyone knew there was a problem. But when Pam's sisters talked about it, it dawned on them that this would explain why all their emails to their uncle had gone unanswered and why they no longer saw any of his posts on Facebook. The uncle never explained what he was doing...he just cut off all communication with no explanation. Now, that kind of situation happens all too frequently among families and friends. And it usually can be traced back to a root of bitterness. Bitterness is like a cancer that can eat away at our soul. I've seen this happen with marriages. I've seen it happen with kids toward their parents. Once someone told me they had such deep bitterness toward their former employer, they would kill them if they had the chance. And I had no doubt they would do it if they could. Bitterness is one of the soul poisons that prevent us from living a healthy life. This is the third week in our series called Soul Detox. Through this series we want to provide practical ways to rid ourselves of the toxins that poison our soul. Our goal is to help all of us to live with joy and abundance. My prayer has been that God would use this series so we can be freed from bondages that keep us from experiencing a full and robust life. Jesus says: ""...I have come that they may have life and have it to the full."" John (10:10)"
Ephesians 4:31,"('Slander', 'Lethal Language')",Independent/Bible," Introduction Three weeks ago we began our current series and Josh talked about getting rid of the self-destructive lies that many of us think about ourselves. When we think that ""we're not good enough"" or that ""we're not pretty enough,"" or that ""we're not loved or valued or important,"" we play right into the Devil's hand. The Devil only has evil intentions toward us--he wants to steal from us, kill us and destroy us. And one of the most effective ways he does this is by convincing us to believe life-sucking lies about ourselves. But instead of falling for Satan's deceptive tactics, we need to allow God's Word to be drilled into our soul--because Scripture tells us that we matter and that we are important, loved, treasured and valued. Two weeks ago Brandon talked about getting rid of the anger that can poison our soul. Last week I talked about getting rid of bitterness. God wants us to be free from any root of anger or bitterness that can poison our relationships. So this is the fourth week in our series ""Soul Detox."" In this series we're taking a careful look at some of the things that we allow into our lives that poison our soul and prevent us from experiencing the full and robust that God offers. Our hope is that as we begin 2017 we can experience a detoxing of our soul...much like the physical detoxing that's popular today with health experts. Today we focus on getting rid of lethal language--these are the words that hurt and destroy the people around us. Now, a long time ago I realized that one message would probably not change the world. Real life-change is complicated and takes more time than any one message can accomplish. But the more I've thought about today's message, the more I think it could be a game changer. So I hope you'll really dial in. Now, as we consider getting rid of lethal language, I first want to focus on Ephesians 4:31 which says: ""get rid of all...brawling and slander."" Brawling in the original language refers to a public outburst that reveals a loss of control. This describes someone who loses control and verbally vomits on the people around him. Now this not only happens in person, it can also happen in social media. I never cease to be amazed by the hurtful and hateful outbursts that I used to see on Facebook. As a matter of fact, this is one reason I closed down my Facebook account. Too much of what I saw on Facebook was either verbal venting or unseemly self-promotion....and I discovered it was bruising my soul too much. So I decided to close down my account. Slander is blasphemia in the Greek. We get the English word blasphemy from the same root. Literally it means to talk down. Slander is to impugn someone's character by the way you talk about them. It's speaking about someone in a way that lowers the person's reputation in the eyes of others. Slander usually happens when the person being slandered is not present. Now, slander doesn't mean that what's being said is false. In fact, what's being said may be totally true! But when you slander you speak with the intention of demeaning the person or impugning their reputation."
2 Timothy 1:7,"('Fear', 'Unhealthy Fear')",Independent/Bible," Introduction I had so many people ask me about climbing Kilimanjaro that I thought it would be helpful to give you a glimpse of the trip. I want to thank you again for praying for me. During the all-night hike as we pushed toward the summit I thought several times about how many of you were praying for me. It was a huge encouragement. I also thought about the kids who would have classrooms as a result of the money we raised. All-together our group raised $140,000 and that can build quite a few classrooms in Kenya! Pam and I were incredibly impressed by the ministry in Kenya. It's one of the most fruitful mission efforts we've ever seen. There's still time to go with our team this summer. I hope you'll consider it! You can more information at the Connect counter. In a left-handed way, I also thought that climbing Kilimanjaro might set the stage for what I want to talk about today. This is the final message in our Soul Detox series. Throughout this series we've been addressing some of the major things that prevent us from experiencing the full and robust life that God offers us. Thus far, we've considered the self-destructive lies that we think about ourselves. We've also talked about anger, bitterness and the power of our words to build people up or tear people down. Today I'd like to wrap up this series by considering fear. Now, to be honest I was never really afraid about climbing Kilimanjaro. I knew it would be hard and I knew that I would be sore for a few weeks afterward. But even so I'd still like for that 19,000 foot mountain to represent for you whatever it is that makes you fearful. We all have things that make out stomach twist. What are those things for you? Do you know what makes me fearful? Let me list four of them for you... 1. Jumping off high places. Dude, I don't even like jumping off the three meter diving board...that's how much I don't like jumping off high places! 2. Public speaking. Now, I know this may surprise you because I speak for a living. But I can't even begin to tell you how many times my stomach has twisted into knots down in front before I get up to speak. 3. Concern for my adult kids. I have four adult children and at any given time it seems at least one of them is making decisions that can stress me out. As a parent, you never stop loving your kids no matter how old they are...and you never stop aching for them when they make unwise decisions. 4. Will I have enough for retirement? I'm 62 years old and plan to keep serving at Summit for many years. But at this stage of the game, I find myself thinking a lot about how Pam and I will do whenever I step away from being a Lead Pastor. If I let my mind go down the wrong road this concern easily slips into fear. So, what is it that causes you to be afraid? What is it that keeps you up at night with your mind spinning? Now some kinds of fear are helpful. For example, it can be helpful to be afraid of burning yourself or cutting yourself. But other kinds of fear can be unhelpful. For example, I think some of us have an unhealthy fear of loss. And these fears can paralyze us if we don't overcome them. Perhaps we fear..."
"1 Corinthians 12:4-11, Romans 12:6-8","('Spiritual Gifts', 'Serving God', 'Serving Others', 'Gifts Of The Spirit')",Pentecostal," As you know our preaching theme this year is Discovering your Destiny, and recently we have been thinking about what it means to be Chosen by God, Loved by God and Gifted by God. Dictionary.com defines a gift in three ways: 1. Something given voluntarily without payment in return, as to show favour toward someone, honour an occasion, or make a gesture of assistance; present. 2. Something bestowed or acquired without any particular effort by the recipient or without its being earned. 3. A special ability or capacity; natural endowment; talent. All of these are relevant and true about the Spiritual gifts God gives to His people: He chooses to give without payment, He shows Favour to His children, Our gifts are meant to honour God and bring glory to Him, Our gifts are not meant to be used selfishly but for the benefit of others. We do not earn our gifts, they are given to us because of God's Mercy and Grace and Love. The Spiritual Gifts given by God are special, beyond our own natural gifts or talents. Today I want us to consider a familiar passage from 1 Corinthians 12:4-11 where the Apostle Paul writes about the fact that each of us has been given a spiritual gift. ""There are different kinds of spiritual gifts, but the same Spirit is the source of them all. 5There are different kinds of service, but we serve the same Lord. 6God works in different ways, but it is the same God who does the work in all of us. 7A spiritual gift is given to each of us so we can help each other. 8To one person the Spirit gives the ability to give wise advice; to another the same Spirit gives a message of special knowledge. 9The same Spirit gives great faith to another, and to someone else the one Spirit gives the gift of healing. 10He gives one person the power to perform miracles, and another the ability to prophesy. He gives someone else the ability to discern whether a message is from the Spirit of God or from another spirit. Still another person is given the ability to speak in unknown languages, while another is given the ability to interpret what is being said. 11It is the one and only Spirit who distributes all these gifts. He alone decides which gift each person should have."" (1 Corinthians 12:4-11) This part of Paul's letter to the church at Corinth is emphasising that many people with different gifts all working together as one church, one body. Serving God by using the gifting He has given, to speak, to heal, to teach, to build up, to glorify God together. God is the one who is in control. We are His church, His people, His children, and He gifts each of us for His service. God does not give gifts as a reward for how well a Christian lives their life, God gives gifts as He chooses and A spiritual gift is given to each of us so we can help each other. God has given you a Spiritual Gift, every born-again, Spirit-filled disciple of Jesus is gifted in some way. Do you use the gift or gifts you have been given to glorify God? Or do you ignore or misuse the gift you have been given?"
Mark 1:9-15,"('Salvation', 'Gospel', 'Submission', ""Christ's Obedience"")",Baptist," The Submission of the Servant Mark 1: 9-15 Our text today reveals what most consider the beginning of Jesus' public ministry. Up until this point, even in the other Gospels, we have very little detail about the life of Jesus. From this moment on, Jesus will live His life in public scrutiny. In the parallel passages within Matthew and Luke's Gospels, we find more detail about the baptism and temptation of Jesus. There is clearly enough biblical information to preach three separate messages from the text we have read today. However, I want to follow the pattern Mark sets, and look at the verses we've read together. I want to examine the phases of the beginning of Jesus' public ministry as we consider: The Submission of the Servant. I. The Affirmation of Jesus (9-11) - Mark exposes the coming of Jesus to the Jordan River to be baptized of John. This act of submission affirmed His deity and public ministry. Consider: A. The Son's Acceptance (9) - And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. Following the details of John's ministry, preaching repentance and baptizing in the Jordan, Mark reveals that Jesus came from Nazareth and was also baptized of John. We must understand that Jesus was not baptized because He was sinful and needed cleansing, but rather as an act of obedience to the sovereign plan of God. He publicly identified Himself with God the Father and revealed His submission to Him. The baptism of Jesus signaled the beginning of His public ministry. He publicly identified Himself as the promised Messiah, the One who came to redeem and save from sin. His baptism also publicly revealed His total submission to the sovereign will of God to provide the means of salvation for humanity. Also the baptism of Jesus stood as a profound picture of the Gospel message He would preach and fulfill. It pictured His death as the sacrificial atonement for sin and resurrection from the dead! B. The Spirit's Anointing (10) - And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him. As Jesus came up out of the Jordan, following His baptism, the Spirit descended upon Him. Those present likely failed to see the significance of this event, but it was necessary for Jesus and His ministry. He was fully God, and He was fully man. He came to earth, in the form of a man, to live a perfect, sinless life, in order to offer Himself the atoning sacrifice for sin. He was able to live that life of perfection because He was guided by the Spirit within. This was in accordance with prophecy of old, Isaiah 11:1-5. C. The Father's Approval (11) - And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. God the Father proclaimed His approval of Jesus, affirming He was in fact the Son of God. All who were present that day heard a public proclamation of the Father's approval of the Son. Jesus received personal affirmation of the Father. That doesn't mean Jesus doubted the Father, but this served as a reminder of God's approval of His Son."
2 Samuel 15:30-37,"(""God's Will"", ""God's Purposes"")",Independent/Bible," Prov 19:21 ""Many are the plans in a person's heart, but it is the LORD's purpose that prevails."" "" Man can make his plans, but ultimately, God's purpose will prevail. "" David is God's choice as King of Israel, and he will remain as God's choice. Absalom wanted to seize the throne from David, but he will never succeed. "" God's plan cannot be thwarted. Prov 21:30 ""There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan that can succeed against the LORD."" The last verse we ended with last Sunday reads: "" 2 Sam 15:12 ""And so the conspiracy gained strength, and Absalom's following kept on increasing."" It doesn't look good. "" 15:13-14 - 13A messenger came and told David, ""The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom."" 14Then David said to all his officials who were with him in Jerusalem, ""Come! We must flee, or none of us will escape from Absalom. We must leave immediately, or he will move quickly to overtake us and bring ruin upon us and put the city to the sword."" David has to flee. It really doesn't look good. It doesn't matter. God's will has not changed. David remains as King. God's purpose will prevail. "" The sovereign Lord stills preside. Let me show you. 2 Sam 15:30-37 2 Sam 15:30-31 - But David continued up the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went; his head was covered and he was barefoot. All the people with him covered their heads too and were weeping as they went up. 31Now David had been told, ""Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom."" So David prayed, ""O LORD, turn Ahithophel's counsel into foolishness."" "" That's a simple and sincere prayer. ""Lord, frustrate their plan. Let Ahithophel's advice be a foolish one."" "" Right after this prayer, we see God providing a way. God is going to bring in Hushai, David's friend, to achieve this purpose. 2 Sam 15:32-37 - When David arrived at the summit, where people used to worship God, Hushai the Arkite was there to meet him, his robe torn and dust on his head. 33David said to him, ""If you go with me, you will be a burden to me. 34But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, `I will be your servant, O king; I was your father's servant in the past, but now I will be your servant,' then you can help me by frustrating Ahithophel's advice. 35Won't the priests Zadok and Abiathar be there with you? Tell them anything you hear in the king's palace. 36Their two sons, Ahimaaz son of Zadok and Jonathan son of Abiathar, are there with them. Send them to me with anything you hear."" 37So David's friend Hushai arrived at Jerusalem as Absalom was entering the city. David arranged for a spy to be positioned near Absalom. He planned for his supporters from within Absalom's court. He could be kept informed of Absalom's move. 2 Sam 17:1-14 - Ahithophel said to Absalom, ""I would choose twelve thousand men and set out tonight in pursuit of David. 2 I would attack him while he is weary and weak. I would strike him with terror, and then all the people with him will flee. I would strike down only the king 3 and bring all the people back to you. The death of the man you seek will mean the return of all; all the people will be unharmed."" 4This plan seemed good to Absalom and to all the elders of Israel."
Jeremiah 32:27,"('Almighty God', 'God  Almighty', 'God Of Power')",Pentecostal," THE GOD OF ALL FLESH Study Text: Jeremiah 32: 27; 33:3 Introduction: - Listen to what God says in this passage. He is asking this question of Israel, but it is certainly one that we must consider as well. This is a question that goes on even at the hearts of Christians. We often respond with ""Well, no...but..."" . - All of us struggle, at different levels, with the problem of unbelief. Perhaps, like Abraham and Sarah, you've prayed for something for years, but God has not answered. Life is passing you by while you wait. - You struggle with doubt as you often wonder whether He is hearing your prayers. You may have suffered some tragedy, such as the loss of a close loved one, and you wonder, ""Where was God when this happened?"" - Maybe it's a family problem that has dragged on for years. You wonder, ""Why doesn't God do something? Why doesn't He answer?"" - Are you desiring to achieve a huge or great goals and it looks all gloomy, and everything around you is proving impossible. - Are you afflicted with some kind of strange sickness that have refused all medication and you do not know what else to do. Maybe the doctors have given up on you and said you are going to die. - There is hope and good news, men may have given up on you, doctors may have failed you, but GOD is stretching out his compassionate hand and is telling you ""See, I will help you, I will heal you, I will make a way where there seems to be no way because, ""....... the things which are impossible with men are possible with God"" (Luke 18:27). - There is hope, don't give up yet. There is possibility in that which seems impossible, it is in THE GOD OF ALL FLESH.... ""And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible."" (Mark 10:27). - You must learn to expect the impossible, expect the unusual, and expect the miraculous because that is where GOD works. He fixes the impossible and make them possible. - God is the almighty and sovereign God. He is a marvellous God, the God of the miraculous. He is the GOD of all flesh. - This question admonishes us in at least two ways. First, it urges us to see our seemingly hopeless situations as wonderful opportunities to trust our Lord. Surely God is worthy of our trust in our everyday problems, just as He is in that once-in-a-lifetime crisis. - Second, this question encourages us to act on our faith. It is easy to believe in the doctrine of God's omnipotence, but when an impossible situation confronts us, can we cease worrying and trust our Lord to see us through? - We shall discuss the topic under three sub-headings: 1. Fearing Before the Impossible 2. Faith that Sees the Invisible 3. Faith that Attempts the Impossible - Facing the reality of this time, we are living in tough times. Times are tough spiritually. Times are tough economically. Times are tough for the church. Times are tough for the family. Times are tough on individuals. Times are tough for the nation. - In every part of our world today there are some many problems. This problem ranges from great lack, poverty, disease, sudden death, desperate need, drought, False Government, broken home, etc."
John 11:17-44,"('Funeral', 'Funeral Believer', 'Funeral Christian')",Baptist," FUNERAL FOR ALAN MCCANNON John 11:17-44 .Song .Pray The Bible tells us that it is actually good for us to be here today. . In Ecclesiastes 7:2-4 the writer tells us this: 2Better to spend your time at funerals than at parties. After all, everyone dies--so the living should take this to heart. 3Sorrow is better than laughter, for sadness has a refining influence on us. 4A wise person thinks a lot about death, while a fool thinks only about having a good time. . Why would the Bible and I say that it is good to be here. . I say that because this is a time for us to remember the life that God gave Alan. . It is a time to share our memories and encourage and lean on each other. It is a time to grieve, not for Alan but for the loss in our lives that only he could fill. . It is also a time of celebration. A time to celebrate Alan's life here on this rock we call Earth and to celebrate the Eternal life that he has through his faith in Jesus Christ. The writer of Ecc. also tells us in the 3rd chapter verses 1-4 this: 1For everything there is a season, a time for every activity under heaven. 2A time to be born and a time to die. A time to plant and a time to harvest. 3A time to kill and a time to heal. A time to tear down and a time to build up. 4A time to cry and a time to laugh. A time to grieve and a time to dance. .There was a time appointed for Alan. . In doing that, He leaves behind his wife Betty, Ms Betty as I call her. His wife of 35 years. . Alan also has two children, James Michael and Sandra Denise. . Two Grandchildren, Kelley and Jamie and three Great Grandchildren. . Cole Jaden and Gavin. . What a full life he led. We are going to hear another song that Mr. Alan picked but first I would like to share a passage of scripture with you that Ms Betty said he talked a lot about. . It is a passage from the Revelation of Jesus Christ to the Apostle John chapter 22, verses 1-5. 1Then the angel showed me a river with the water of life, clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb. 2It flowed down the center of the main street. On each side of the river grew a tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, with a fresh crop each month. The leaves were used for medicine to heal the nations. 3No longer will there be a curse upon anything. For the throne of God and of the Lamb will be there, and his servants will worship him. 4And they will see his face, and his name will be written on their foreheads. 5And there will be no night there--no need for lamps or sun--for the Lord God will shine on them. And they will reign forever and ever. . I am no great theologian but I do know that the Bible tells us that to be absent in the body is to be present with the Lord. . Alan understands this scripture now, so much more than we do. . Song . In the Gospel of John, chapter 11 verse 17-44 we read about a funeral story. It is the story of Jesus' friend Lazarus read . Jesus had heard that Lazarus was sick and then he got word that Lazarus had died. He and his disciples left and went to the town of Bethany where Lazarus had lived and found out that not only was he dead but that he had been buried for four days."
Ephesians 1:15-19,"('Godly Wisdom', 'Spirit Of Wisdom', 'Spirit Of Revelation')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 1/23/17 Title: The Content of the Prayer (1:15-19) Series: Paul's Letter to the Ephesians--#5 Ephesians 1:15-19 (NIV) 15 FOR THIS REASON, EVER SINCE I HEARD ABOUT YOUR FAITH IN THE LORD JESUS AND YOUR LOVE FOR ALL GOD'S PEOPLE, 16 I HAVE NOT STOPPED GIVING THANKS FOR YOU, REMEMBERING YOU IN MY PRAYERS. 17 I KEEP ASKING THAT THE GOD OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST, THE GLORIOUS FATHER, MAY GIVE YOU THE SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND REVELATION, SO THAT YOU MAY KNOW HIM BETTER. 18 I PRAY THAT THE EYES OF YOUR HEART MAY BE ENLIGHTENED IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY KNOW THE HOPE TO WHICH HE HAS CALLED YOU, THE RICHES OF HIS GLORIOUS INHERITANCE IN HIS HOLY PEOPLE, 19 AND HIS INCOMPARABLY GREAT POWER FOR US WHO BELIEVE. THAT POWER IS THE SAME AS THE MIGHTY STRENGTH Introduction Paul has been singing the praises of the God of all grace. The Christian's life is anchored in Jesus Christ. From our election in Him before time began, to the final salvation of which the indwelling Spirit is the guarantee, everything we need to live ""to the praise of His glory"" (1:12, 14) is found in Christ. His grace makes us rich with the blessings of redemption, forgiveness, adoption, and spiritual illumination. These are, in Paul's beautiful expression, ""the riches of His grace, which He lavished upon us"" (1:7-8). The resulting fruit in our lives is diverse: humility in the face of God's eternal election; sanctity in our lifestyle because He has chosen us to be holy, stability because we know we are anchored into the eternal heart of God; doxology (a hymn, verse, or form of words in Christian liturgy glorifying God) because we have been so richly and fully blessed. When Saul of Tarsus first experienced this grace it turned him into a man of prayer: ""The Lord told him, ""Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying"" (Acts 9:11). Even now, perhaps two decades or so later, we find him still on his knees: ""For this reason I kneel before the Father"" (Ephesians 3:14). The adoration of the Lord in His grace always led him to intersession for his brothers and sisters. Commentary Notice verse 15 begins with ""For this reason,"" thus connecting the phrase with what preceded it. Paul prays with thanksgiving for the Ephesians (and presumably others in the same region who received his letter). He has been told about their transformed lives. Two features dominated the report he received about them: their ""faith in the Lord Jesus"" (trust in Christ as the Divine Son of God) and ""their love for all God's people"" (the saints). The kind of love he is referring to is not sentimentality or emotionalism of any kind, but ""caring""--caring for other people because God has cared for us by giving us Christ. These make up the two features Paul always seemed to look for as marks of genuine conversion (as his frequent reference to them in other passages indicates: see 1 Corinthians 13:13; Galatians 5:6; Ephesians 6:23; 1 Thessalonians 1:3; 3:6; 1 Timothy 1:14; 2 Timothy 1:13; 3:10; Titus 2:2; Philemon 5). Authentic Christianity always transforms both the Godward and manward dimensions of life. Otherwise, our professions of faith are hollow."
Galatians 6:1-5,"('Humility', 'Restoration', 'Church Discipline', 'Love For One Another')",Evangelical Free," Tell me: If you were caught for drunken driving, and the headlines in the Lyons News said, ""So-and-so Arrested for Drunken Driving,"" would you go to church the next Sunday? Most people would say, ""No,"" because they'd be too embarrassed to face their Christian friends. But why not go to church the next Sunday? After all, church is a place to find healing. Fred Smith, who likes to ask this question of people, says it's stupid not to go to church after you've messed up. ""It's sort of like a man who's hit by an automobile, and he's got blood all over the place, and his bones are broken, and they try to take him to the hospital, and he says: 'Wait. I'm a mess. Let me go home and get cleaned up. Let me get these bones set, let me heal, and then I'll go to the hospital.'"" (Steven Brown, ""A Calvinist Talks About His Friend, John Wesley,"" Preaching Today, Issue No. 58; www.PreachingToday.com) The problem is too many churches, instead of being places of healing for broken people, are places of judgment and condemnation; or worse, they are places where the brokenness is ignored and everybody pretends everything is alright. The question I want us to ask this morning is: How can we become a place of healing for broken people? How can Faith Bible Church become a restorative place for people who have messed up? How can any Church become a place where people caught in sin get set free? Well, if you have your Bibles, I invite you to turn with me to Galatians 6, Galatians 6, where we find out how. Galatians 6:1 Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted. (ESV) If we want to become a place of healing for broken people, then 1st of all, we must... RESTORE THE SINNER, not ignore their sin. We must care enough to mend a broken life or set a person straight before they completely destroy themselves. The word for ""restore"" was used by doctors in Bible times to describe setting a broken bone, making it straight again, restoring it to its former condition. The word was also used by fisherman to describe the mending of nets. In Matthew 4 and Mark 1, we see fisherman on the shore of the Sea of Galilee mending their nets. It's the same word used here in Galatians 6. Their nets had torn and become useless, so they took the time to sew their nets back together again. They were restoring their nets, making them useful again. And that's exactly what the sinning believer needs! Sin has ripped away at their life and made them useless. They don't need somebody to tear away at them some more. They need somebody to come along side and mend them. They need somebody to help make them useful again for God's service. God calls us to restore the sinner, not blame him. Someone once wrote: Blame never affirms; it assaults. Blame never restores; it wounds. Blame never solves; it complicates. Blame never unites; it separates. Blame never smiles; it frowns. Blame never forgives; it rejects. Blame never forgets; it remembers. Blame never builds; it destroys. So don't play the blame game, because nobody wins in that game. Restore the sinner; don't blame him."
"Mark 1:16-20, Luke 5:1-11","('Evangelism', 'Call', 'Obedience', 'Disciples', 'Disciple')",United Methodist," Fishers of Men Mark 1:16-20 It was the morning after a bad night of fishing if we read in from Luke 5. The disciples were tired. Simon and Andrew were in one boat, and apparently James and John were in another. They were near shore and casting their nets. We get more details in Luke, but for purposes of brevity, I will stick to the account given here in Mark which is also substantially the same as that given in Matthew. It seems from John 1 that Andrew and John had been disciples of the Baptist, and we also know that Andrew brought his brother Simon to Jesus. It also says they stayed the day with Jesus. If we are to harmonize this account to John, we have to take the previous encounter as temporary in that they soon went back to work. This is not unlike the picture we get of the disciples in John 21 which records a similar incident to that recorded in Luke. So we should realize that the call to be fishers of men we see in this morning's passage was not a complete leap of faith into the dark as Kierkegaard thinks. They had some knowledge of Jesus personally. And although they probably not scholars and invited by the Rabbi of their synagogue for further study, they were at least given a primary education in Scriptures. The disciples were portrayed by the Jewish authorities in Acts as uneducated idiots, but one must be careful not to read too much into ad hominem attacks against someone's character. As fishermen who had to sell their fish, they had to have enough business sense to barter. And as Greek culture had invaded Palestine for almost 350 years, this probably included the idea that at least one of them knew some Greek. They may also have been literate as well. Amongst their peers, they tended more to the middle class than a lot of the poor of the land surrounding them. God was preparing the disciples for a much greater purpose than the catching of fish. He was working on them even before the existential moment when Jesus commands them to follow Him permanently. I feel this is true of anyone God calls to the work of ministry. Paul certainly felt this way as did Jeremiah. Even Abraham before his call in Genesis 12 had attained to some degree of education and culture, even though He did not know Yahweh. And he may have been called more than once as the Scripture says in one place that he was called out of Ur of the Chaldees. But in Genesis it says that his father removed from Ur to Haran, and that is where God calls to Abraham in Genesis 12. Many who have been called to ministry by the Lord does not get it the first time. Many of us like Jonah run the other way until this call is repeated with authority. Then we now we must follow Jesus. And this is the type of call the disciples understood. To them it was confirmed as Luke reports by a miraculous catch of fish. This time they knew Jesus was for real. They had grappled with this before, but now they knew. They left all behind and followed Jesus. Perhaps the catch of fish was so great that the sale of them would cover the loss to Zebedee of valuable workers."
Luke 2:8-12,"('Christmas', 'Jesus Is Lord', 'Jesus  Is Lord')",Independent/Bible," Introduction Last weekend Pam and I, along with Moises Mendez, were in Chile. We went with leaders from a church Summit planted in Santa Rosa, CA, called Living Roots, Grace Church on the west side of town, Reno Christian Fellowship on the south side of town and Sparks Christian Fellowship...right here in Sparks. This was a vision trip. Our goal was to encourage these churches to help us advance the cause of Christ in Chile by cooperating in mission projects. This trip is an outgrowth of some special personal relationships. For the past ten years I have met for lunch every month with Dan Frank from Grace, Brent Brooks from RCF and Scott Parker from SCF. We've become close friends and prayer partners. Now, it looks like our friendship will be a catalyst for mission work in Chile. This represents a new level of cooperation for our churches! We're also planning a mission trip next November and I think all of the churches will have people going with us. We'll have more information about that after the first of the year. I know some of you prayed for us while we were in Chile...and I want to say thanks! I also want to thank Jim McMorran and Summit's Global Outreach Team for believing this was a worthwhile effort. One of the most exciting results is that we also hope that Grace, SCF and RCF will help us to lead a region wide serving day next year. So we hope the growing cooperation among our churches will not only be in Chile...but also right here in the Truckee Meadows. Isn't that amazing!!! Now, I'd like you to watch this creative rendition of the Christmas carol ""Away in a Manger."" ""Away in a Manger"" was first published in a Lutheran Sunday School curriculum in 1885. Now, there's a lot of controversy about who wrote the lyrics. Some think the carol was written by Martin Luther, one of leaders of the Great Reformation. But after careful research now most scholars don't think that was the case. So there's a bit of a mystery regarding who actually wrote it. But there is no mystery at all that the carol touches hearts around the globe every holiday season. Now, there's a phrase that's used in the song that I want to focus on today. It's repeated in every stanza. Away in manger no crib for his bed... ...the little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head. The stars in the sky look down where he lay... ...the little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay. The cattle are lowing the poor baby wakes... ...the little Lord Jesus no crying he makes. So over and an over again we see this repeated phrase referring to the Lord Jesus. And today rather than focusing on Jesus as a newborn baby lying in a manger, I want to focus on what it means for Jesus to actually be the Lord Jesus. Did you know that 740 times in the New Testament Jesus is referred to as Lord? Do you know what this means? It means that Jesus is Lord! That's one of the most repeated statements in the entire New Testament! Would you say that out loud with me? (Repeat) We see this in the first announcement about Jesus' birth in Luke 2:8-12. I'd like for you to turn there in your Bible or on your mobile device. This is a familiar passage about the birth of Jesus...and from the moment of his birth the angel wants us to know that Jesus is no ordinary child....even in the manger Jesus is the Lord Jesus!"
Matthew 6:23-24,"('Finances', 'Financial Wisdom')",Independent/Bible," Introduction If you've been with us at Summit for any length of time, you've heard us say that God wants us to experience a life with him that's full and robust...a life with meaning and purpose. A few months ago, our memory verse was John 10:10. Jesus is speaking and he says, ""The thief comes to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full."" Would repeat that with me? We see here one of the most encouraging promises that Jesus makes...he promises that we can experience a life with him that's full and robust! Now, in this text the thief refers to Satan. He's the one who wants to rob us of a life that full and robust. And one of the most common ways that Satan steals our abundant life is through our finances. Why? Because it's nearly impossible to experience the kind of full and robust life that Jesus offers when our finances are in disarray. This is why it's so important to learn how to follow God's guidelines when it comes to our resources. You've probably heard this before....but the Bible has more to say about managing money and possessions than it does about heaven, hell, prayer or almost any other topic you can think of. Do you know why? Because nothing battles for our hearts as fiercely as money and possessions! This has always been true...but I think it's even more true today than ever before. Think about it...all day long we are bombarded with advertisements which are designed to make us discontent so that we do what? Spend money! Jay Walker-Smith is president of one of the nation's largest marketing firms. He says that we've gone from being exposed to about 500 ads per day back in the 1970's to as many as 5,000 a day. All day long on Facebook or Google or the radio or TV or billboards or magazines we are inundated with messages screaming at us to buy something, or to take a trip, or to eat out somewhere. Because of this constant pressure to spend money, many of us get knocked off-balance and we end up not managing our finances very wisely. This is apparent from the following statistics I've seen recently: "" A few months ago an on-line group called GoBankingRates surveyed more than 7,000 Americans. They discovered that 69% of those surveyed had less than $1,000 in savings. Breaking it down even further they discovered that 34% of Americans don't even have a dime in their savings account. The study cited two main reasons for the chronic lack of saving: First, many people are living beyond their means because so much of our lives revolve around entertainment and other forms of discretionary spending. This shows you the success of the constant pressure from the media to spend, spend, spend. The second reason people don't save is credit cards...which make it incredibly easy for us to spend money that we don't have. "" Speaking of credit cards....I saw another study that revealed the households that carry a balance on their credit cards carry an average balance of $16,048. Perhaps some of us feel the weight of that credit card debt every single day! Now, you know as well as I do that credit cards generally charge up to 20% interest on the unpaid balance. So the interest alone on a $16,000 balance amounts to hundreds of dollars a month. And if you only make the minimum payments it could take decades to pay off. So, this is a huge problem!"
Mark 7:1-13,"('Tradition', 'Follow Christ', 'Follow Jesus', 'Relationship To God', 'Relationship To Jesus')",Baptist," The Ministry, Message, and Messiah in the Book of Mark Week 16: ""A Real Relationship with Jesus is Better Than Rules, Regulations, and the Tradition of Religion"" (Mark 7:1-13) Crossroads Community Church Rev. Ricky A. Rohrig Sr., Founding Pastor There is always a way to do things in life like your way, my way, the highway, or the right way. What I am getting at is there rules all around us; things that are put in place to tell, or show us how to do things. Sometimes we agree with the rules and other times we do not. Sometimes the rules makes sense to us, and at times we thing they are absurd. In the OT there are 613 laws or rules that applied to people's lives. If you were a keeper of the law like the Pharisees you would have studied these laws and known them very well. The Pharisees were known as spiritual fathers of modern Judaism. Their main distinguishing characteristic was a belief in an Oral Law that God gave to Moses at Sinai along with the Torah. The Torah, or Written Law, was akin to our modern day U.S. Constitution in the sense that it set down a series of laws that were open to interpretation. The Pharisees believed that God also gave Moses the knowledge of what these laws meant and how they should be applied. This oral tradition was codified and written down roughly three centuries later in what is known as the Talmud. The Pharisees also maintained that an after-life existed and that God punished the wicked and rewarded the righteous in the world to come. They also believed in a messiah who would herald an era of world peace. Pharisees were in a sense blue-collar Jews who adhered to the tenets developed after the destruction of the Temple; that is, such things as individual prayer and assembly in synagogues. In today's message we are going to see how Jesus rebukes the Pharisees as I minister and teach from this thought, ""A Real Relationship with Jesus is Better Than Rules, Regulations, and the Tradition of Religion!"" (repeat) Mark 7:1-13 1 Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem. 2 And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault. 3 For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders. 4 And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables. 5 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands? 6 He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. 7 Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. 8 For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do."
Mark 7:14-23,"('Reflection', 'Reflecting God', 'Time Of Reflection', 'Reflecting Christ', 'Inside Of Me')",Baptist," The Ministry, Message, and Messiah in the Book of Mark Week 17: ""The Outside is a Direct Reflection of the Inside"" (Mark 7:14-23) Crossroads Community Church Rev. Ricky A. Rohrig Sr., Founding Pastor How many of you have been sick? All of us right! Think about how it happens, it is something on the inside that is going on to alert us. Our body is so complex and advanced that we have warning systems. It is in those times that it alerts our mind that hey something is not right here. The inside of our body alerts our external by various forms. That's how our physical body works; but you know what? That is how our spiritual body operates as well. Would do I mean? Think about what happens when we come to a spiritual crossroads in life? When we visibly face a situation on the ""outside"" we have the Holy Spirit on the inside of us that gives us warning signs when something is wrong. That's why Paul tells the Romans in Romans 12:9 9 Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. Dissimulation means sincere without hypocrisy. Abhor means to dislike, to literally detesting that which is evil, sin. Cleave to which is good. Cling to it, hold onto it with all your might, power, and strength. That's our spiritual warning system! God wants us to refrain from the evil one, who plants seeds of doubt, makes you ponder and tries to justify why doing right is okay, and pushes you in a direction to sin. Through the Holy Spirit we have the awesome ability not only to recognize sin, but to refrain from it, run from it and to Him! As we continue in our series: The Ministry, Message, and Messiah in the Book of Mark"" I am going to teach and minister from this thought today, ""The Outside is a Direct Reflection of the Inside!"" Turn to your neighbor and say neighbor, The Outside is a Direct Reflection of the Inside, now turn to your other neighbor and say neighbor, The Outside is a Direct Reflection of the Inside. Now let's say it all together, The Outside is a Direct Reflection of the Inside! Please open your Bibles, smart phones, or tablets to Mark 7:14-23. Let us stand in reverence for the reading of God's Holy word. Mark 7:14-23 14 And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand: 15 There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man. 16 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. 17 And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable. 18 And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him; 19 Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats? 20 And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. 21 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,"
Psalms 119:33-40,"('Teacher', 'Great Teacher', 'Learn From God')",Anglican," Have you ever tried to obey God but at the same time you thought that you did not have the understanding or the strength to do so? If so, you're not alone. The writer of the passage we heard from Psalm 119 felt the same way. The theme of that reading is growing and walking in faith and not growing weak. This walk is the road to spiritual maturity. Psalm 119 is a psalm in celebrating God's law. The psalmist asked God to teach him to obey God's Law. That might seem strange since laws are something we either do or don't do, so there's not much thought necessary. The psalmist knew that God's Law is really about having our hearts changed to align with God's will for our lives. The Psalmist represents those of us who have trusted Christ as our Lord and Saviour. The psalmist, like us, was restored to life by God's power, and like us he had to grow in that life. He needed God to teach him, and we also need God to teach us. God's Word is all we need for godly living. By grasping its powerful message, we as God's children can be pure. God's Word teaches sound doctrine. It is one thing to be taught and another thing to understand that teaching. God, like a good coach of a sports team or an athlete, shows us the basics and we must start with them. God has the responsibility to give us both content and understanding. As we ask for it, and as we obey what God shows us, our knowledge will grow throughout our lives. God is happy when we obey Him wholeheartedly-that is, without hesitating or asking questions. God doesn't have to explain everything he asks to do. Obedience will provide us with the explanation. If we want to live the life God wants us to live, we have to be very choosy about what we give our lives and attention to. God's Word shows us the right path to take. It calls us out when we take a detour. It teaches us how to stay on the path God has laid out for us. Instead of seeking happiness in the things of this world, we must seek happiness in God's Word. We must not lose sight of what is really important in our churches and our Christian lives. For example, too many people think of a church as just a building, Church buildings are important, but God's work will go on regardless of where people meet to worship God. When the Disciples of Christ Church in Milton was being ""remodeled"" and moved, the congregation met for worship in the church office. They still did God's work, and I can tell you from experience preaching there that the Holy Spirit was very much alive and home there. Many of the things we focus on in life won't matter very much in the end, especially if they are worldly things. When we lie on our deathbeds, we won't wish we had worked harder or made more money or had a better job. We will likely wish that we had loved God more, focused on people more, spent more time with our families, shared our faith more, prayed more and pursued God's purpose for our lives."
Matthew 5:38-48,"('Love Your Enemies', 'Turn The Other Cheek')",United Methodist," ""I Was Hoping Jesus Didn't Mean It"" Matthew 5:38-48 A pastor tells the story of stumbling into his kitchen after a long day of work. He put down his groceries and pressed the voice-mail button. It was one of his church members: ""Pastor, I'm doing the Scripture reading for Sunday, and I have that passage where Jesus says, 'Turn the other cheek.' You know that passage, right? Do the other Gospels have that same passage? Is it different in the other Gospels? Could you let me know, because...no offense, but I think Jesus is wrong."" It's been said that the history of Christian interpretation reveals something we would rather not say out loud: many of us are, perhaps, suspicious that Jesus may have been wrong or misquoted in this section of the ""Sermon on the Mount."" And so, many people have gone to great lengths to try and explain away Jesus' words in all kinds of ways. And when this is done suddenly the commands seem historically distant and irrelevant to us. And then, people in the pews sit back and exhale saying: ""Whew, I was hoping Jesus didn't mean it."" ""I mean this is crazy talk. ""We want to be Christians at covered-dish dinners. We really enjoy being Christians at Christmas and Easter. We like to vote for politicians who say they are Christians. We even like being Christians at a funeral--especially if the preacher questions the salvation of anyone who isn't a Christian. But this isn't Christianity--what Jesus is talking about here! It is way too extreme. It's not what we signed up for."" Let's face it, many of us don't want to be Christians--which means to be like Christ--when it's time to turn a cheek, give away our coat, go the second mile, give to a worthless beggar, or loan anything we have to anybody who wants it. What kind of ""Christ-like person"" is that? It sounds like foolishness, right? The truth be told though, Matthew's Gospel as a whole, and the Sermon on the Mount in particular, repeatedly insist that Jesus actually does indeed mean exactly what He says. Uh oh. In a world that's ""all about me"" Jesus offers an alternative that most of us find extremely difficult to imagine or live out. It's easier to be mean, hold grudges and ignore those in need. There are certain t-v preachers and mega-church theologies that love to tickle our ears--boiling down the hard particulars of what Jesus says into a mushy, vaguely spiritual thing that would work really well on a Hallmark card. But the Real Jesus will have none of this. One ancient Christian teacher once said: ""The Lord who accompanies us on our journey offers his own cheek to slaps and his shoulders to whips."" And as Christ's followers we are called--here in Matthew Chapter 5--to ""love as God loves."" Now, don't get me wrong. We can't do this on our own. It's not like a ten-week muscle building-fat burning work-out."
Proverbs 21:5,"('Financial Management', 'Financial Wisdom')",Independent/Bible," Introduction I'd like to begin by making an observation. There are people in this room who live in comfortable homes and drive nice cars and eat in good restaurants who are not doing as well financially as they appear to be doing. We all like to think that we're good at crunching numbers...but sometimes when we look at everything we're dealing with, we feel like instead of us crunching the numbers, the numbers are crunching us! One couple said, ""Expenses are getting much easier to meet these days. Everywhere we go we meet them!"" We live in the richest country in the history of the world. Yet financial freedom seems to be more elusive than ever. Why is that? Why in the middle of the richest country in the world do so many of us find ourselves not financially free? Well, I want to suggest to you, in part, it's because we have bought into some money myths. We've heard these money myths so many times they've become ingrained in us. For example, here's the first money myth. Myth #1: All I need is just a little bit more. I mentioned this a few weeks ago. Somehow we think that all of our problems will be solved if we just had a little bit more money. This mentality has led to a sobering reality in many homes across America...we argue about money more often than we care to admit. One Gallup poll indicated that 65% of all married couples argue over money. So the myth that all we need is just a little bit more leads many of us to argue about money. This myth also causes some of us to spend money we don't have by leveraging credit cards. It doesn't matter if you make a hundred dollars, a hundred thousand dollars or a hundred million dollars. If you ask most people how much it would take for them to become financially free, they would probably say, ""Just a little bit more."" So we're never content. We're always striving to make one more dollar. That's what makes Paul's words in 1 Timothy 6 so challenging. He says, ""Godliness with contentment is great gain...But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that."" Now the fact is every one of us in this room has food and clothing, but only a few of us are content. ""Godliness with contentment is great gain"" but ever so few people find this contentment. This is because of the myth that to be happy we've got to have a little bit more. The words of Ecclesiastes 5:10 certainly ring true. ""Whoever loves money never has money enough; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with his income...."" The problem for 95 percent of us is not that we need more--that's a myth. The reality is this--most of us don't have an income problem; we have a financial management problem. We need to learn how to give, how to save and how to live wisely with the income we have, and not to keep expecting more money to solve our problems. I read about one financial planner on TV who was trying to encourage people--especially young people--to pay cash for vehicles they could afford rather than financing large sums of money. He said the average car payment in the US is $378 a month. He said if you're 24 years old and instead of financing the car for $378 a month, you pay cash for a car that you could afford and you started saving $378 a month...typically by the time you would retire do you know what that $378 a month would be worth? $4.4 million! Then he looked at the audience and said, ""I hope you're enjoying the very expensive new car that you're driving!"""
Psalms 131:1-3,"('Humility', 'Hope', 'Contemplation', 'Sermon On The Mount')",*other,salms 131; Isaiah 49:8-16; Matthew 6:24-," Title: The Contemplative Life King David shares with us some key concepts of the Contemplative Life - 1. It is a life of Realized Humility 2. It is a life invested in Study, Stillness and Silence and 3. It is a Life founded in Hope in God INTRO: Have you ever found yourself envying the life of a dog or cat? One person listed these five reasons why they envy their dog: +They are allowed to lay around or sleep most of the day +They get to hog the bed +Everyone wants to feed them +They get all kinds of free back massages +They never have a bad hair day In our family we have these two wonderful border collies, one fantastic little sheltie and an adopted outside orange mackerel tabby cat. I cannot begin to tell you the pleasure and joy we all experience sharing life with them. At times that life is hectic; especially in the mornings when it involves meal time. Or when the two border collies are playing Frisbee trying to avoid the cat who does his best to jump in every now and then. Sandi, our sheltie has decided that with all that activity she just likes to sit on the porch and watch. More than once she has been bowled over by a mad crazed border collie trying to catch a Frisbee. And then there are those other times. When all of them take some time and simply lay down and rest. Over the years I have noticed that all three dogs enjoy their own time out period. Each of them will go to an area of the house and lay down and rest. The cat of course just finds a sunny place and settles down for a long time of rest. I am not sure he is doing anything more than being lazy but of the four animals it appears that he takes his rest time more religiously. Over the years, I have been amazed at how they are able to shut the world away, get away from all the noise and take some time to rest. I have also watched that afterwards they seem to have more strength and are ready to engage in some play time or one on one time. They seem to need those quiet moments of rest and repose. We can see parallel patterns in other animals as well. This is especially true of the golden eagle. Each day the golden eagle has to fly up to its centering place. It's a place where they are able to quieten down and regain their strength. Afterwards they are able one more to soar into the heavens and hunt for their food and take care of their families. In our Gospel reading our LORD makes some similar statements concerning the birds of the air and the grass of the fields. They also know how to rest in the Lord's care and protection. They seem to know that everything is in the Lord's hand. They instinctively sense that the Lord their God will take care of all of their needs. But what about us this morning? Are we able to do what all these animals, the birds and even the grasses of the field are able to do? Are we able to find a life of contentment? Are we able to find a life filled with inner peace and serenity? Or are we condemn to a life of relying on things like Xanax. Librium, Valium or Ativan? In our modern nanosecond world are we condemned to live a life filled with anxiety, worry and angst? Does the LORD have an answer to all of this?"
Ecclesiastes 3:1-11,"('Memorial', 'Memorial Service', 'Funeral Believer', 'Funeral Christian')",Assembly Of God," One of the major themes in the book of Ecclesiastes, and certainly a theme that is reflected in our passage this afternoon, is that everything in this life, including life itself, is temporary. The author wrote that, ""For everything there is a season. A time to be born and a time to die."" Words that are so relevant and appropriate to us today. In an instant - in one short sentence, the author has expressed how fragile life really is. ""There is a time to be born and a time to die."" This reminds us that life is a precious gift to be enjoyed, even though life is brief. Today we have come together in the shadow of sorrow and grief, and yet we realise the glorious light, the greatest hope, that the world has ever known. The promise of an eternal life for the faithful Christian. Together, today, there are many wonderful memories of Doris that shine out as we remember and celebrate her life. Let us hold on to them instead of our sorrow. There are many occasions that people draw together, but none of them affect us more than the loss of an aunty, a member of our family, a friend, and a faithful Christian woman. We gather today to remember the treasured times that we drew from her love, her strength and encouragement. We can comfort each other in this time of grief. We know that we are creatures of time by the way we set our clocks and watches so that we will know what hour it is. We have schedules and appointments set by dates on a calendar. We know larger amounts of time by measuring the months and years. We also know the seasons of spring, summer, autumn and winter. But perhaps when reflecting on someone's life, to measure time, or years, or age, is to miss something that is so much more important. Isn't life more than a measurement of years? Perhaps our lives should be measured by the relationships that we have with others. That is why you are here today - isn't it? Because you knew... You are her family in Christ, you are her friends, and you have come to remember the life of someone you knew and loved. That is important and I commend you for being here today. We have heard this afternoon about... life and accomplishments. We have heard about her relationships with others, many of whom are here to celebrate her life. And there is so much we can learn from... life. She was an obedient servant of the Lord. She served the church, and she lovingly served God's people. She had a steadfast faith which remained with her until she left us to go home to our Father God. She will always be remembered as a woman of love, humility, and faith. Today we have come here not to mourn the loss of... but to celebrate her life. Her life here on earth may be over, but her life in heaven with her beloved Saviour Jesus Christ has just begun. We can rejoice because she gave us so much in her time with us, and we praise God that her life where there is no more pain, no more tears, no more concerns, no more doubt, and no more illness, has begun with our God in her new home. There is a time to weep and a time to laugh. There is a time to mourn and a time to dance. There is a special feature to our reading today, and it is one of completeness. What do workers gain from their toil? God has made everything beautiful in its time, and he has restored... in his glorious presence. He set eternity in her heart, as he has ours, and now she gets to spend that eternity with God in all his glory."
1 Thessalonians 4:13-18,"('Last Call',)",Baptist," WHAT HAPPENS ON EARTH AFTER THE CHURCH IS RAPTURE? After the true saints of God are caught away we will see it all take place. Unbelievers are left here on earth the unbelieving are left in their graves. 1Thessalonians 4: 13 But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. 14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. 15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. 16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: 17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. 18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words. 1. There will be great consternations on earth. Matthew 24: 37 But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. 38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, 39 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. 40 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. 41 Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. 42 Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. There will still be Churches & projectionists . Revelation 3: 10 Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. Matthew7: 20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. 21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. 2. Now comes the antichrist. 2nd Thessalonians 2: 3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; 2nd Thessalonians 2: 8 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: Here comes the imitator of the true Christ. Revelation 6: 1 And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see. 2 And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. Revelation 19: 11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. 12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself."
Ephesians 1:20-23,"('Heavenly Citizenship', 'Heavenly Realms', 'His Right Hand', 'Power And Dominion', 'Rule And Authority')",Baptist," By: Tom Lowe Date: 2/5/17 Lesson 6: The Immensity of God's Resources (1:20-23) Series: Paul's Letter to the Ephesians Ephesians 1:20-23 (NIV) 20 HE EXERTED WHEN HE RAISED CHRIST FROM THE DEAD AND SEATED HIM AT HIS RIGHT HAND IN THE HEAVENLY REALMS, 21 FAR ABOVE ALL RULE AND AUTHORITY, POWER AND DOMINION, AND EVERY NAME THAT IS INVOKED, NOT ONLY IN THE PRESENT AGE BUT ALSO IN THE ONE TO COME. 22 AND GOD PLACED ALL THINGS UNDER HIS FEET AND APPOINTED HIM TO BE HEAD OVER EVERYTHING FOR THE CHURCH, 23 WHICH IS HIS BODY, THE FULLNESS OF HIM WHO FILLS EVERYTHING IN EVERY WAY. Introduction Dear reader, as you read this lesson; notice the emphasis with which the Apostle affirms the supremacy of Christ's nature, Ephesians 1:21-22. This is a psalm of ascension. We can almost follow His tracks, as all the evil powers which rule the darkness of this world drop far beneath Him. The ascending Lord is high over all, an if we claim our right as members of His glorified body, we also shall stand above all our spiritual adversaries; and it is easier to descend on an enemy from above him than to seek to assail him from beneath. Notice that Christ needs the Church as much as the head needs the body, because it is through the Church that He fulfills Himself. Ask Him to fill all of you with all of Him. Commentary 20 He exerted when he raised Christ from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms. The King James Bible seems to have a better translation: ""Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places."" ""He exerted when he raised Christ from the dead."" The raising of Christ from the dead was an awesome display of ""power."" The ""power"" which He (God) exerted on that occasion was as great as that which He brought to bear during the six days of creation. It was capable of imparting life to a cold and ""mangled"" body, to open again the arteries and veins, and teach the heart to beat and the lungs to heave. It was able to diffuse vital warmth through the rigid muscles, and to communicate to the body the active functions of life. It is impossible to conceive of a more direct exertion of ""power"" than in raising up the dead; and there is no more striking illustration of the nature of conversion than in such a resurrection. The same power that produced the marvelous miracle of Christ's resurrection now works in the hearts of believers. To appreciate this, we must bear in mind the apostle's full doctrine of the resurrection of Jesus, embracing not only the reviving of His dead body, but the transformation of that body into a spiritual body, and the designation of Jesus as a second Adam, who would transmit or communicate to His spiritual seed both a renewed soul and a glorified body, as the first Adam transmitted a sinful nature and a corruptible body to his natural seed. The power that accomplished all this works in believers, and can surely work in them all, needed transformation There are many articles of faith contained in this verse, such as, that Christ died, that He is raised from the dead, that He was raised from the dead by God the Father, and that His resurrection was by the power of God: the resurrection of any person is an event requiring great power, but Christ's resurrection from the dead was an instance of peculiar and special power; for he was raised from the dead as a public figure, representing all his people, for whom he became a surety; and he was raised again for their justification, and to bring great glory to Himself, after He had been born into a family with very low standing indeed. Christ's resurrection is called a begetting, and He is said to be the first begotten from the dead. And the regeneration of men is often compared to the resurrection from the dead. Just as Christ's body was really dead and lifeless, prior to His resurrection, so men, before their conversion, are dead in trespasses and sins, and destitute of spiritual life. And, just as Christ's human nature could not help itself, could not raise itself, neither can dead sinners convert themselves, or bring themselves out of that state and condition in which they are by nature; and as the resurrection of Christ was the pure work of God, and a display of his almighty power, so the work of faith, of grace and conversion, is entirely the work of God, which is begun, carried on, and finished entirely by His power; and while Christ's resurrection was meant to bring Him glory, so is the regeneration and conversion of men meant to provide them enjoyment of the heavenly inheritance."
Matthew 5:38-48,"('Extra Mile', 'Turn The Other Cheek', 'Turn Other Cheek')",Catholic," 7A Sun. We are back to Matthew 5, and in verse 41 we hear about going the extra mile. 1). It's not conflict avoidant because the subjugated person forced to carry the luggage of a Roman solider beyond the customary one mile actually creates a dilemma for the soldier who would worry that he would face punishment for exacting service for excessive distances. The verse has been expanded to include all types of extra service. Philippians 2:4: ""Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others"". There are no traffic jams along the extra mile. E.g. Second mile service for a business-- A fast food executive asks, ""What do our customers expect in the first mile? They expect a clean parking lot, soap in the dispenser. They expect two pickles on the sandwich."" But this company goes the second mile. The second mile for the average $ 7 order is fresh flowers on all the tables, fresh ground pepper, with second-mile vocabulary like, ""May I refresh your beverage?"" ""I'll be assisting you to your table today""--unexpected words and phrases that are a way of saluting these customers and saying that we care about you, personally. [The company is Chick-fil-A). At home, and in marriage, it's about the best interest of my spouse. Wash or fuel the car, excuse her from grocery shopping, allow him/her to sleep in; these things cannot be prescribed or required in advance but they help in smooth functioning, like helping coworkers; tolerating temporary impositions without complaint; supporting the Bishop's Lenten Appeal. 2). Verse 39 speaks of a slap on the right cheek, which would involve a back-handed slap from a right-handed person. In Jewish jurisprudence such a slap was regarded as far more insulting than a normal slap and involved a double penalty. Turning the other cheek is a creative response that robs the aggressor of the power to humiliate and shames the one who intended to inflict shame. Psychologically speaking, this teaching to turn the other cheek reveals that agreeable individuals are able to short-circuit the cue-aggression sequence, likely by recruiting prosocial thoughts in response to aggression-related primes. Offer no resistance to the one who is evil is the principle of non-retaliation. But, in certain circumstances another rule or law takes precedence, like self-defense. The point of the `turning the other cheek teaching' is that there is a way to work out problems, even the problem of evil to prevent it from escalating. Jesus realized that violence produces only more violence. St. Maximilian Kolbe was asked by a fellow prisoner in Auschwitz, ""Shouldn't we hate the Nazis?"" His answer was, ""No, because only love conquers."" We view those who have hurt us as wounded. What they have done to us is only a symptom of their brokenness. e.g. I'm grateful for my fans, friends, & my enemies for they all are a part of my testimonies. From Leviticus 19 in our First Reading we heard the Golden Rule: love your neighbor as yourself. In from our Gospel text today, ""Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you""."
"2 Corinthians 7:5, Revelation 3:7","('Come', 'Battle For The Mind', 'Come To The Opened Door')",Assembly Of God," THE BATTLE GROUND OF THE MIND... IMPRISONED? There is an open door of opportunity... By Wade Martin Hughes, Sr. Kyfingers@aol.com TEXT: Revelation 3:8 I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. THE KING INVITES YOU TO COME... ONCE THERE WAS A GREAT KING THAT LOVES HIS PEOPLE SO DEARLY. He desired to show his people how much he loved them. The King prepared a great BANQUET AND INVITE ALL HIS PEOPLE TO ATTEND. There was a requirement to keep the enemies away. There was A LOCK PLACED ON THE PALACE. The key to unlock the palace door was simple. Each of his people were REQUIRED TO BRING THER PRETTIEST FLOWER that blooms in their garden. So the crowds began together for this special dinner with the King. They had beautiful flowers in their hands. They would step up to the door of the Banquet Hall and extend their flower and the doors would open to them. There were ROSES OF SHARON, LILIES OF THE VALLEY, Hidden among the crowd were some that had FLOWERS OF DECEIT, POPPIES OF PLEASURE AND ENTERTAINMENT. Others carried the HEMLOCK OF HATRED AND BLOOMS OF BITTERNESS. PETALS OF PASSION AND SIN WERE OFFERED. The gates were locked and those that OFFERED FLOWERS OS SIN AND SELFISHNESS were refused admission. The glorious BLOOD -RED ROSE offered be the HAND OF THE FAITHFUL opened the GATES TO THE PALACE OF THE KING. The pure white LILY OF THE VALLEY made purchase of COMMUNION WITH THE KING AVAILABLE. WHAT FLOWER IS THAT IN YOUR HAND? WILL YOU ACCEPT THE INVITATION TO BE WITH THE KING? 1. Have you purchased a piece of land? (POSSESSIONS) 2. Have you got to prove your oxen? (BUSINESS) 3. Have you just got married? (RELATIONSHIPS) DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH THE KING! AGAIN? BONDAGE AGAIN? ARE WE FOREVER TRAPPED? YOU CONTROL IF THE DOORS ARE OPEN? YOU DECIDE WHEN THE DOORS ARE SHUT... Romans 8:15 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.

John 1:6-18,"('Born Of God', 'Christ As Light', 'To Bear Witness', 'Believe In His Name')",Calvary Chapel," John 1: 6 - 18 The 'Light' Reflector 6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. 7 This man came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all through him might believe. 8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. 9 That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him. 11 He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him. 12 But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: 13 who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. 14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. 15 John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, ""This was He of whom I said, 'He who comes after me is preferred before me, for He was before me.' "" 16 And of His fullness we have all received, and grace for grace. 17 For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 18 No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him. We read in the book of Genesis chapter 1 this, ""1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2 The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. 3 Then God said, ""Let there be light""; and there was light. 4 And God saw the light that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. So the evening and the morning were the first day. 6 Then God said, ""Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."" 7 Thus God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so. 8 And God called the firmament Heaven. So the evening and the morning were the second day. 9 Then God said, ""Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear""; and it was so. 10 And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas. And God saw that it was good. 11 Then God said, ""Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb that yields seed, and the fruit tree that yields fruit according to its kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth""; and it was so. 12 And the earth brought forth grass, the herb that yields seed according to its kind, and the tree that yields fruit, whose seed is in itself according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 13 So the evening and the morning were the third day. 14 Then God said, ""Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs and seasons, and for days and years; 15 and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth""; and it was so. 16 Then God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He made the stars also. 17 God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth, 18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. 19 So the evening and the morning were the fourth day."
Joel 3:1-16,"('Last Days', 'Armageddon')",Assembly Of God," The Last Battle Text: Joel 3:1-16 Introduction 1. Illustration: Most people think the last battle of the American Civil War was at Appomattox Courthouse. The Battle of Palmito Ranch, also known as the Battle of Palmito Hill, is generally recognized as the final battle of the American Civil War. It was fought May 12 and 13, 1865, on the banks of the Rio Grande east of Brownsville, Texas and a few miles from the seaport of Los Brazos de Santiago, more than a month after Robert E. Lee had surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant in the Eastern Theater. Though the Battle of Appomattox Court House is identified as the last major battle of the war, Palmito Ranch was the last engagement between organized forces of the Union Army and Confederate States Army involving casualties. 2. The last battle of the world will be called Armageddon. It is described as the rallying-place of the kings of the whole world who, led by the unclean spirits issuing from the mouth of the dragon, the beast and the false prophet, assemble here for ""the war of the great day of God, the Almighty"" ( W. Ewing, The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia). 3. In that battle... A. God Will Repay B. God Will Have The Last Say C. God's Will Be The Last Voice 4. Let's stand together as we read Joel 3:1-16. Proposition: In the end, God will have the final say about human history. Transition: In the final battle... I. God Will Repay (1-8). A. Valley Of Jehoshaphat 1. We live in a time where there is little or no reverence for God. People in our society think that they are more important than God. They have believed the lie that God doesn't exist and that, in the end, they will not have to answer to anyone but themselves. 2. Joel chapter 3 tells us a very different story. It begins with, ""At the time of those events,"" says the LORD, ""when I restore the prosperity of Judah and Jerusalem..."" A. Because of the judgments set during the ""Day of the Lord,"" Israel's situation in the world will be dramatically changed, and God will deal justly with the nations of the world for the way they have treated His people Israel (Wiersbe, The Bible Exposition Commentary - The Prophets, 339). B. The judgment is not merely a decision concerning guilt or innocence. It is God's wrath on the nations. C. As can be seen in Zech. 14:2f, God will summon the nations to war against Jerusalem so that He can bring his wrath upon them (The Complete Biblical Library - Daniel-Malachi, Under: ""Chapter 3""). 3. Then God says, ""I will gather the armies of the world into the valley of Jehoshaphat. There I will judge them for harming my people, my special possession, for scattering my people among the nations, and for dividing up my land. 3 They cast lots to decide which of my people would be their slaves. They traded boys to obtain prostitutes and sold girls for enough wine to get drunk."" A. This great battle will take place in the Valley of Jehoshaphat, a site mentioned nowhere else in Scripture. B. In verse 14, it's called ""the valley of decision,"" referring to God's decision (decree) to punish the nations."
John 14:16-17,"('Power', 'Judgment')",Assembly Of God," February 19, 2017 Morning Worship Text: John 14:16-17 Subject: The Holy Spirit Title: Another Counselor - The Holy Spirit Part 2 We continue this week in our series on the work of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers. I believe this is so important to the life of any church and there is so much value in the fact that Jesus wants us to have the baptism in the Holy Spirit that He told His disciples don't do anything until you have been endued with power from on high. Can you see this? Everything that we are, everything that we can be, is hinged on what we will allow the Holy Spirit to do in us. 16And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever--17the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you. I believe this is God's word... I believe it is for me.. I accept it as mine... I will appropriate it to my life today... Last week we focused on the word ""another"". In the Greek there are two words translated ""another"" and they have two different meanings. 1) another as in something totally different. ""let's move in another direction"" or, 2) another as in different but exactly the same. That is the word that Jesus used here. Allos. But when Jesus said He would send another counselor that must mean that another was going to be replacing one that already was - Jesus Himself. He was their counselor, their comforter, their teacher and now He is sending another one. The significance of this is seen in the empowerment aspect of the coming promise of the Father. Jesus Himself never began His public ministry until the Holy Spirit had come upon Him for empowerment. Now we have to stop here and set apart the two different acts of grace concerning the Holy Spirit. The first is when the Holy Spirit comes into the life of the believer at salvation in indwells them. It is the evidence of a changed life for everyone who has accepted Christ as their Lord and Savior. John 20:22 (NKJV) 22 And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and said to them, ""Receive the Holy Spirit. The second act of grace is the Baptism in the Holy Spirit. It is this baptism in the Spirit that Jesus was speaking of when He told His disciples to go into the city and wait. Acts 1:5 (NKJV) 5 for John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now."" John 7:38-39 (NKJV) 38 He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water."" 39 But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him would receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified. The indwelling of the Spirit at salvation is for eternity... the baptism in the Holy Spirit is for now! I want you to listen to this. Both acts of grace - salvation and the Baptism only come through faith. Both require that your mouth be involved. Romans 10:9-10 (NKJV)"
"Luke 24:49, Acts 1:4-8","('Faith', 'Waiting On God')",Pentecostal," Lu 24:49 Tarry Until Ye Be Endued You and I will never mature spiritually until God's words to us are taken personally as they are written. It seems that we all have this ability to take God's word and sift it until all that is left is what we like. What is comfortable convenient, easy on our flesh, what is Pleasant. It seems that some where between our ears and our hearts is this sifter that sifts out all the Commandments and all the conviction until all were left with is suggestions and blessings and the things that we want to do and the things that feel good. That's why our churches today are full of spiritual midgets, dwarfs that should be and could be men and women of great spiritual stature. They should have and could have great spiritual power and authority! but because they won't eat anything but spiritual Cream of Wheat they are spiritual dwarfs. They should be and could be Mighty Warriors but they are ""Gerber babies"" what do I mean Gerber babies? I mean cute but no power. By now they should be spiritual Warriors but instead their spiritual wimps. They've been raised on strained bananas and pureed prunes because they wouldn't take the word as it is. When we take God's word as it is: It comes loaded with vitamins and nutrients, it comes in a form that requires you to exercise your muscles and use your teeth. It comes loaded with protein and power. Jesus said the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and life. He meant if you will take them and chew them up and digest them, they will grow you up. They will build his life into you, they will build his character, his anointing his power into you. My job is ""not"" to see to it that your diet is always Cream of Wheat and pureed peas and carrots but to set the table with some filet mignon, some prime rib, some pork chops, some T-bone steaks along with some green beans spinach and broccoli. If you're able to digest everything I give you in the same service then I need to go deeper. Because you should leave with your mouth full still chewing thinking and meditating on what has been said. All through the week that word should be stirring in you, exciting you, inspiring you to pray and to read and study God's word for yourself. Acts 1:4-8 the last command of Jesus to his followers and his disciples before his Ascension was go to Jerusalem and tarry (wait) for the promise! Tarry there until you be endued with power from on high. This was not a suggestion it was a command of the master: that commandant has never been withdrawn. To every disciple to every follower of the Lord Jesus Christ, the commandant still stands. Go to Jerusalem and stay there until you be en dued with power from on high. Jesus needed that in enduement of power and he received it in the river Jordan. If the very begotten Son of God needed that Supernatural in enduement of power how much more do we need it? Out of at least 500 people Jesus spoke those words to: only 120 made it to the upper room ( that means 380 thought they had a better idea) and bypassed The Upper Room."
Romans 8:28-39,"(""God's Love"", 'Questioning')",Christian Church," QUESTIONING GOD'S LOVE? Romans 8: 28-39 And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. 31 What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? 32 He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? 33 Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. 34 Who then is the one who condemns? No one. Christ Jesus who died--more than that, who was raised to life--is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. 35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? 36 As it is written: ""For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.""[j] 37 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. 38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,[k] neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. INTRODUCTION: Have you ever find yourself in that situation questioning God's love? My story: I questioned God's love for me when I was a kid, a teenager, etc. There is a tendency to question God's love when: - We don't receive answer to our prayers. - We are suffering or hurting and God is silent. - We compare ourselves with other people and we see that they are healthier, wiser, wealthier, prettier, etc. than us - We are not satisfied/ content with our situation. ( A satisfied life is better than a successful life.) Did you ever wonder what to do when you're in that situation that you are questioning God's love for you? ARE YOU QUESTIONING GOD'S LOVE? What should we do? Today I want to share with you three things to do: I. THINK ABOUT HIS LOVE V.32 Remember- Go back to what God has done in the past. Note: Your present situation is overwhelming you or the future so think about the past- think about how he showed his love to you. When you think, when you go back you will find evidences to prove that God loves you. 32 He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him Romans 5:8 But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. There's a song with the title, ""Think about his Love"". it says... Think about His love, think about His goodness Think about His grace that's brought us trough For as high as the heavens above So great is the measure of our father's love Great is the measure of our Father's love"
Ephesians 1:19-23,"('Resurrection', 'Power', 'Headship', 'Supremacy')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Scripture Today, we are concluding a series of sermons on Ephesians 1 that I am calling, ""God's Supreme Purpose."" In Ephesians 1:3-14, which is one, long, complex, glorious sentence in the original Greek, the Apostle Paul praised God for salvation. Paul praised the Father for planning our salvation, the Son for purchasing our salvation, and the Holy Spirit for applying that salvation to us. In Ephesians 1:15-23, which is also one, long, complex, glorious sentence in the original Greek, the Apostle Paul prayed for the saints to grow in their understanding of, and appreciation for, the blessings of salvation. Last week we looked at verses 15-19a, and examined Paul's praise and petition to God for believers. In today's study in verses 19b-23, we shall examine God's power in Christ. Let's read about God's power in Christ in Ephesians 1:19b-23: 19 ... according to the working of his great might 20 that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, 21 far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come. 22 And he put all things under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church, 23 which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all. (Ephesians 1:19b-23) Introduction Kent Hughes tells the story about a school fire in the town of Itasca, Texas, just before World War II that took the lives of 263 children. There was scarcely a family in town which was not touched by this horrifying tragedy. During the war Itasca remained without school facilities. But when the war ended, the town, like many others, began to expand and in fact built a new school which featured what was called ""the finest sprinkler system in the world."" Civic pride ran high. Honor students were selected to guide citizens and visitors on tours of the new facility to show them the finest, most advanced sprinkler system technology could supply and money could buy. Never again would Itasca be visited by such a tragedy. With the postwar boom the town continued to grow, and seven years later it was necessary to enlarge the school - and in adding the new wing it was discovered that the sprinkler system had never been connected. Can you believe that? It is so incredible that it is hard to believe. Yet, it was true. The sprinkler system was never connected to the main water supply. Sadly, that is a parable of what happens in the lives of too many Christians. Far too many Christians don't know, understand, or appropriate the power of God that is available to them. So, Martyn Lloyd-Jones asks, The most urgent practical question for every Christian is this: Are we aware of the fact that the almighty power of God is working in us? Do we realize that we are what we are solely and entirely by the grace and the power of God? Do we realize in our own personal lives and experiences that it is this exceeding great power of God that accounts for everything in the Christian life? I press these questions again because I am convinced that the main trouble with most of us is our failure to realize the greatness of the salvation into which we have been brought, and which we enjoy together."
Ephesians 5:1-5,"('God', 'Pattern', 'Ephesians')",Christian/Church Of Christ," INTRODUCTION "" SLIDE #1 "" The efficiency expert concluded his lecture with a note of caution: ""You do not want to try these techniques at home!"" "" ""Why not?"" asked a man from the audience. "" ""After years of not paying attention, I suddenly noticed my wife's routine at breakfast,"" the expert explained. ""She made lots of trips to the refrigerator, stove, table and cabinets; often she carried just a single item at a time. So I asked her, 'Hon, why don't you try carrying several things at once? It'd be much more efficient.'"" "" ""Well, did your suggestions save much time?"" the attendee asked. "" ""Actually, yes,"" the efficiency expert responded. ""It used to take her twenty minutes to get breakfast ready. Now I do it in seven."" (MIKES FUNNIES) "" Today as we continue in our Turning Over a New Leaf series, we are going to examine a New Pattern for Life to consider. "" When we build things, we usually follow some pattern, plan or blueprint. "" How would we feel if we were going to have someone come in and install new counter tops in our home and they did it all on the phone? "" They never came by your home to look at your existing cabinets, they never took one measurement, and they never made a pattern to follow so they could cut your new tops to fit. "" Would that make you feel confident in what you would get from them? "" We follow patterns life, many of us build our life on a pattern that was instilled within us when we were children, some decided they did not like the pattern for life they were offered and decided to construct their own pattern. "" For some their pattern is no pattern, they just make it up as they aimlessly wander through life. They can never seem to figure out why they never get anywhere. "" Today we are going to examine two different patterns for life. "" The pattern of life we chose to mold our life from will determine what type of person will become. "" Let's turn to Ephesians 5, we will be in verses 1-5 and we will open with verses 1-2. "" SLIDE #2 "" Ephesians 5:1-2 (HCSB) -- 1 Therefore, be imitators of God, as dearly loved children. 2 And walk in love, as the Messiah also loved us and gave Himself for us, a sacrificial and fragrant offering to God. "" SLIDE #3 SERMON I. A flawless pattern for life. "" One of the challenges of living our new life in Christ, is getting away from our old way of life. "" In order to do that, we need to follow a new pattern of life, a pattern that is not flawed, but one that is flawless. "" Paul starts this chapter with the word, THEREFORE! Since Christians are a new creation in Christ, since God has forgiven us when we are immersed into Christ, our new self should begin to bear a resemblance to the family of God. "" Then we are told to be imitators of God as dearly loved children. "" In our society, when we think of an imitation, we think of something that is fake or counterfeit.

Always hold on to GOD thru prayers. ""[For I always pray to] the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,"" Our relation with GOD is He is our FATHER and our GOD as well. Ephesians 1:3 (Amplified Bible) May blessing (praise, laudation, and eulogy) be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) Who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual (given by the Holy Spirit) blessing in the heavenly realm! John 20:17 (Amplified Bible) Jesus said to her, Do not cling to Me [do not hold Me], for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to My brethren and tell them, I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God. The LORD JESUS has set us an example to follow, that He is totally 100% dependent on the FATHER GOD. John 5:30 (Amplified Bible) I am able to do nothing from Myself [independently, of My own accord--but only as I am taught by God and as I get His orders]. Even as I hear, I judge [I decide as I am bidden to decide. As the voice comes to Me, so I give a decision], and My judgment is right (just, righteous), because I do not seek or consult My own will [I have no desire to do what is pleasing to Myself, My own aim, My own purpose] but only the will and pleasure of the Father Who sent Me. John 15:5 (Amplified Bible) I am the Vine; you are the branches. Whoever lives in Me and I in him bears much (abundant) fruit. However, apart from Me [cut off from vital union with Me] you can do nothing."

Mark 9:41-50,"('Patience', 'Time And Space')",Catholic," Thursday of Seventh Week in Course Joy of the Gospel We continue in the season which the Extraordinary Form calendar still calls Septuagesima, or the seventy days before Easter. The penitential season of Lent begins on March 1, and we must focus on the efforts we need to make to improve our imaging of Jesus and Mary. It is a lot easier for us to focus on what other members of our family, or office, or parish organization need to do to improve their imaging of Jesus and Mary. Ourselves, not so easy. I was in conversation with a colleague recently, who told me why they had left the Church before marrying, and then later mentioned that the oldest child had a same-sex ""life partner."" It would have been so easy to speak judgementally-""well, do you think your leaving the Church and not raising your children as Catholics might have something to do with that?""-but it would have alienated a colleague and made it pretty impossible to be of service later. I told this acquaintance that the only person I can judge is myself, and I'm not very good even at that! Both Jesus ben Sira and Jesus give good advice to us who are doing daily examinations of conscience. Especially Sirach's warning not to presume on the mercy of God. Repent daily, and you'll never have to count on a priest being around when you are dying. The Holy Father is setting down some principles for building a just and peaceful society, and now talks about time and space. When he says ""space"" he is writing about territory and the number of people involved: 'A constant tension exists between fullness and limitation. Fullness evokes the desire for complete possession, while limitation is a wall set before us. Broadly speaking, ""time"" has to do with fullness as an expression of the horizon which constantly opens before us, while each individual moment has to do with limitation as an expression of enclosure. People live poised between each individual moment and the greater, brighter horizon of the utopian future as the final cause which draws us to itself. Here we see a first principle for progress in building a people: time is greater than space. 'This principle enables us to work slowly but surely, without being obsessed with immediate results. It helps us patiently to endure difficult and adverse situations, or inevitable changes in our plans. It invites us to accept the tension between fullness and limitation, and to give a priority to time. One of the faults which we occasionally observe in sociopolitical activity is that spaces and power are preferred to time and processes. Giving priority to space means madly attempting to keep everything together in the present, trying to possess all the spaces of power and of self-assertion; it is to crystallize processes and presume to hold them back. Giving priority to time means being concerned about initiating processes rather than possessing spaces. Time governs spaces, illumines them and makes them links in a constantly expanding chain, with no possibility of return. What we need, then, is to give priority to actions which generate new processes in society and engage other persons and groups who can develop them to the point where they bear fruit in significant historical events. Without anxiety, but with clear convictions and tenacity."
1 Peter 3:15,"('Church', 'Apologetics', 'History')",Independent/Bible," In the Church today, a debate rages over the relationship of philosophy and theology to one another. Some scholarly believers as epitomized by Norman Geisler argue that, since this world is God's world, both can be used to understand Creation if each of these disciplines are approached from a Bibliocentric perspective. The other side of the debate contends that, since theology contains God's revelation to mankind, philosophy at best merely repeats the understanding of theology or at worst actively undermines theology by enshrining human reason as the ultimate standard. This debate extends back to the earliest days of the Church. Living in the Hellenistic world awash with numerous philosophies, mystery cults, and state religions, the Church quite early on had to address these realities. Basing their approach on Paul's Mars Hill missionary efforts in Acts 17, early Christians advocating the value of philosophy pointed out that philosophy could be used as a point of contact with the unbeliever when both philosophy and theology concurred on certain matters. For example, Paul was able to win the attention of some Stoics because of the similarities between Christianity and that particular philosophy. Justin Martyr, who went from being a Stoic to an Aristotelian to a Pythagorean to a Platonist, ultimately settled upon being a Christian because he categorized the faith as the true philosophy. The second approach emphasized its own Pauline justification as well by invoking I Corinthians 1 where in the passage the world's wisdom is categorized as foolishness. Elsewhere, Colossians 2:8 says, ""See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception."" Those adhering to this approach noted how philosophy often bred heresy and unbelief. A number of Church Fathers favorably disposed towards philosophy harbored questionable beliefs often linked to Platonism. For example, Origen of Alexandria believed that Satan was not beyond redemption since the Devil is a spirit not unlike a run of the mill human being (Gonzalez, 80). Such a perspective was often derived from the Platonic view that God was a nondescript entity that did not create the universe from nothing and did not personally care for individual human beings. Yet God as revealed through Scripture and incarnated in Jesus Christ is known personally by His followers and cares when even the tiniest sparrow falls to the ground. When viewed from a certain light, both of these approaches relating philosophy and theology possessed merit. Each agreed regarding the centrality of God's revelation of Jesus Christ and on the need for salvation. Those appreciating philosophy were correct in pointing out that all truth is God's truth and that segments of truth can be used to introduce the lost to the source of all truth. Those leery of philosophy were correct in pointing out the danger the discipline would wreak if left unchecked. The descendants of the early Church walking the Earth would do well to consider both of these positions."
Acts 1:1-5,"('Kingdom Of God', 'Kingdom Of God', 'Theophilus')",Baptist, Corinthians 1.1," April 23, 2013 By: Tom Lowe Series: The Early Church Title: The Reaffirmation of the Promise Acts 1.1-5 (KJV) 1 The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, 2 Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen: 3 To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God: 4 And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me. 5 For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence. Commentary The former treatise have I made, The former treatise, undoubtedly, refers to the gospel, which was written by St. Luke, and bears his name. There Luke recorded the history of the Gospel, which features the life of Christ; His teachings and actions. At one time the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts were joined together as one book with two ""volumes."" Can you imagine what it would be like if the Book of Acts were missing from the New Testament? You would pick up your Bible and see the ministry of Jesus ending in the Gospel of John; next you would read about a guy named Paul writing to followers of Jesus in Rome. Who was Paul? How did the gospel get from Jerusalem to Rome? The Book of Acts answers these questions. A great New Testament scholar (Barclay) has said that the title of Acts might be, ""How they brought the Good News from Jerusalem to Rome."" We really don't know all that much about Luke from the New Testament. We know that he was a doctor; we know that he was a Gentile, and we know that he was a companion of Paul. There was a time when many scholars thought that Acts was sort of a romance novel of the early church, written at least 100 years after the events supposedly happened. But William Ramsay, a noted archaeologist and Bible scholar, proved that the historical record of Acts is remarkably accurate regarding the specific practices, laws and customs of the period it claims to record. It is definitely the work of contemporary eyewitnesses. In the mid-1960's, A.N. Sherwin-White, an expert in Greco-Roman history from Oxford, wrote about Acts: ""The historical framework is exact. In terms of time and place the details are precise and correct . . . As documents these narratives belong to the same historical series as the record of provincial and imperial trials in epigraphical and literary sources of the first and early second centuries AD . . . For Acts the confirmation of history is overwhelming . . . Any attempt to reject its basic historicity even in matters of detail must now appear absurd. Roman historians have long taken it for granted."""
Matthew 18:1-5,"('Childlike Faith', 'Little Children', 'Kingdom Of God')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," What does it mean to go before God as a Child? Jesus said, ""Assuredly, I say to you, unless you change and become as little children, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven."" (Matthew 18:3) There is a secret complicity between the kingdom of God and a child. One day, the twelve apostles were arguing about who was the greatest (Mark 9:33-37). Jesus guessed what they were talking about and said some surprising words that turned their whole outlook upside down and called it into question: ""If someone wants to be the first, they will be the last of all and the servant of all."" He then did something that corresponded to his words. He took a child, placed him in the middle of that gathering of future leaders and said to them, ""Whoever welcomes a child like this one in my name, welcomes me."" Jesus identified himself with the child he had just taken into his arms. He affirmed that ""a child like this one"" represents him best, so that welcoming such a child is equivalent to welcoming him, Christ. Other day, people brought children to Jesus so he could bless them. The disciples were displeased. Jesus got upset and told them to let the children come to him. Then he said, ""Whoever does not welcome the kingdom of God like a little child will certainly not enter it"" (Mark 10:13-16). God seeks a childlike mildness and meekness, a jubilant childlike heart ... and a childlike faith. Faith builds character, and the process starts when you are a child. Without faith, we cannot please God. (Hebrews 11:6) Did you know that from the beginning God's purpose in creating human beings was to welcome them into His family? This is why God created us"" in His image, and likeness"" (Genesis 1:26). The apostles John tells us, ""Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God!"" (1 John 3:1) To go before God as a child is to go before God stripped of our sins and doubts, full of wide-eyed inspiration that comes from total love and trust. Adults have a tendency to become cynical with age, while a child has yet to be touched by the concerns of the world. But the older we get, the more ""hurdles of doubts and concerns"" we tend to place in front of us. Sin separates us from God. It also hinders us from enjoying the love of God. To become like little children, sinners must be born anew. Conversion makes men like little children. What Qualities Does a Child Have? A child is innocent. A child is dependable. A child believes without complication. A child has no preconceived notions of the world. A child loves others without bias. A child is feeble and humble. A child is content in the little things. A child has the faith to move mountains. A child is awed by majestic splendour. A child takes to heart God's Word in all its simplicity. A child is creative, cheerful and affectionate A child trusts without reflecting. Children cannot live without trusting those around them. Their trust is not a virtue; it is a vital reality. To encounter God, the best thing we have is our child's heart that is spontaneously open, that dares simply to ask, that wants to be loved."
Mark 9:42-50,"('Hell', 'Sin', 'Saltiness', 'Radical Faith')",Baptist," Radical Obedience Mark 9:42-50 Rev. Brian Bill February 18-19, 2017 Did you hear about what happened in California this past week when the spillway around the nation's tallest dam started eroding so severely that officials warned a 30-foot wall of water could be unleashed on towns below? Around 200,000 people were ordered to evacuate. This mandatory order triggered a chaotic exodus, filling highways with evacuees. Some chose to ignore the warnings, putting their lives at severe risk. Apparently people have been allowed to return now as water levels have receded. Our passage today contains some of the strongest words ever spoken by Jesus about the severity of sin and the harsh reality of Hell. If we ignore them, we do so at our own peril. One of the reasons I like preaching verse-by-verse through books of the Bible is because we're forced to deal with warnings we'd rather avoid. Most pastors would not put a sermon series together called, ""The Severity of Sin and the Harshness of Hell."" One of the many things I like about Edgewood is the high view of Scripture and hunger for biblical preaching. In fact, one of the guys in the Growth Group Beth and I lead on Wednesday nights has been asking me to do a 12-part series on Hell. When I told him what the topic was this weekend he said, ""Bring it on!"" We're not going to skip this section or water it down because Jesus cautions us to be careful about how we live. Turn to Mark 9:41-50 where we'll encounter a series of stern warnings. Last weekend we were challenged to not exhibit a drive for personal status or to have an attitude of group superiority. We're going to see today that we must avoid causing a follower of Christ to sin, we must cut off anything that causes us to sin and finally, we must live out the cause of Christ. 1. Avoid causing a follower of Christ to sin. Listen to the front half of verse 42: ""Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin..."" Jesus put a young child in the midst of the disciples and then picked him up to make the point that we must become least and last if we are serious about following Christ. We're called to receive the forgotten and the marginalized - the preborn, children, orphans, widows, the poor, the disabled, the mentally challenged, those who are deaf or blind, those in prison, immigrants, the persecuted, refugees, and minorities. Picking up on that scene, Jesus now refers to little ones ""who believe"" in Him. He's talking about our brothers and sisters in Christ. We see this because He uses a different word for ""little ones"" here. 1 John 2:28 refers to Christians as little children, ""And now, little children, abide in him."" We're cautioned against causing even ""one of these little ones"" to sin. The word for sin here is the word skandilizo, from which we get scandalize. It means ""to offend, to entice, to entrap, or to put a stumbling block"" in front of someone. Most of us don't consider how our attitudes and actions can be the cause of a fellow Christ-follower falling into sin but 1 Corinthians 10:32 says: ""Give no offense to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God."""
Acts 3:11-4:4,"('Believe', 'Gospel', 'Covenant', 'Repentance')",United Methodist," They Just Don't Preach Like This Any More Acts 3:11-4:4 Martyn Lloyd Jones constantly reminded his parishioners in his sermons that the church did not suddenly arrive in the 1960's, but has been around for two thousand years. He would recount all of the pundits of his day who tried to redefine the mission and message of the church to be relevant to the times. These church leaders felt that the church had to either adapt or die. However, Lloyd-Jones took a different look at it. He could see the pathetic state of affairs in the church in England of his day. Only 5 percent attended Christian worship services on a given Sunday. Many who identified themselves as ""Christian"" were only culturally so. Lloyd-Jones instead pinned the church's identity crisis and loss of power on the fact they left the Christian message behind and replaced Bible study with social gatherings, preaching with drama and skits, the message of the cross with a political and social message. Dr. Jones invited the church to go back to its roots if it wanted to turn things around. The record of Apostolic preaching can be found in the Book of Acts. He spent many years preaching through the first eight chapters of Acts and these sermons have been preserved in books and some audio if you care to inquire further. He was far more eloquent than I would ever hope to be. This morning, we see an example of apostolic preaching. The occasion was brought around by the healing of a lame man at the gate of the Temple. As this was at the hour of prayer, the Lord knew that a large crowd would be gathered at that time. The man had been carried there for forty years to beg at the Beautiful gate. As a cripple, he was not allowed to enter the sanctuary itself dud to a Rabbinic interpretation of the words of David when he was besieging Jerusalem. The healing allowed him to enter the Temple, into where the Jewish people felt was where the Lord was most present. The crowds knew this man. They had seen him for years. They could see when they looked at him that his feet were deformed. And they were utterly amazed to see him not just walking but jumping. This was no miracle like we would see today when a surgeon performs an operation and makes a cripple able to walk. That person would have to go through extensive physical therapy and would have to learn and walk just like everyone else. But this man immediately received strength, and started walking and jumping. Even the Jewish authorities could not gainsay what happened. Naturally, the buzz spread throughout the crowd and caused many to turn aside to see this man. Here was a burning bush moment when God distracts us from the everyday affairs, even the humdrum of a church service, to get our attention. So they all gathered to the covered porch of Solomon. A place where rabbis often taught, or should I say ""approved"" rabbis. Peter saw that the crowd had their attention and being led by the Holy Spirit began to speak. First of all, he tells them that they are fixing their attention on the wrong thing, that is upon Peter and John or upon the miracle itself. Peter and John were just instruments of Jesus who actually performed the miracle through them. It is not enough to distract the world for a minute, the distraction has to be rightly focused. Peter was fast to correct the misconception that the 120 in the upper room were drunk on new wine and from there redirected the experience to its proper focus which was it was the fulfillment of biblical prophecy."
Titus 1:1-4,"('Ministry', 'Leadership', 'Mission')",Independent/Bible," As Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with President Donald Trump this week, there was much on the line. Revolving around their common interests, the future economic, security and travel implications of their citizens was on the line. For the Apostle Paul, his discussions with Titus in Titus 1, had the issue of the Gospel at stake. With an emphasis on God's saving work (both God and Christ are repeatedly called Savior: 1:3, 4; 2:10, 13; 3:4, 6) the opening greeting sets this theme by centering on the nature of gospel ministry. Titus was the direct legate, envoy, or ambassador of the apostle, sent to Crete to strengthen the churches for the purpose of effective evangelism in that pagan culture. Under the compulsion of divinely revealed absolutes from the Lord in the power of the Spirit. God, who desires to save sinners, wanted to prepare Titus for the building of congregations able to reach the lost. If we desire to have the life changing Gospel of Christ impact the lost as it has impacted us, then we need to have particular commitments. There are many voices, from our own thoughts, from other well-meaning Christians or even those in marketing that want to convince us that we need to dumb down the message in order to have the greatest impact. They suggest that we follow the principles of modern marketing that says to have an easy message, presented in a easy way, calling for an easy response. Paul shows Titus in that the only real way to impact the lost for Christ is to be controlled by God, following His mission, message, means, while serving one another. Such a process is guaranteed to produce life changing results because they are of God and He has promised to bless them. In Titus 1:1-4, Paul calls Titus in Leading by Example revealing five core features that guided his life and service to God upon which the Church must be built in order to reach the lost. Effective Gospel Ministry must be 1) Committed to God's Mastery (Titus 1:1a), 2) Committed to God's Mission, Message and Means (Titus 1:1b-3), as well as 3) Committed to God's Members (Titus 1:4). In order to reach the lost, Effective Gospel Ministry must be: 1) Committed to God's Mastery (Titus 1:1a) Titus 1:1a Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, (for the sake of the faith of God's elect and their knowledge of the truth, which accords with godliness) (ESV) Above all else, the apostle saw himself as a man totally under divine authority, ""a servant of God"". This was his commitment to God's mastery The apostle's Hebrew name was Saul, after the first king of Israel. Soon after his miraculous conversion and calling by Christ, however, he came to be known exclusively by his Greek name, Paulos (Paul). With full truthfulness, Paul could have identified himself as a brilliant scholar, a highly educated Jewish leader who also was learned in Greek literature and philosophy. He could have flaunted his inherited Roman citizenship, an extremely valuable advantage in that day. He could have boasted of his unique calling as apostle to the Gentiles, who was granted full privilege and authority alongside the Twelve. He could have boasted of being ""caught up to the third heaven, ... into Paradise"" (2 Cor. 12:2, 4), of his gift of miracles, and of being chosen as the human author of a great part of the Scriptures of the new covenant. He chose, rather, to identify himself foremost as a servant of God. This wording would suggest a direct connection to Moses, David, and others in the OT who were described as servants of God (e.g., Moses, Ps. 105:26; David, 2 Sam. 7:4, 8; and the prophets, Jer. 7:25; 25:4; Amos 3:7; Hag. 2:23). The effect is to place Paul in the long line of those who have been God's spokesmen from the beginning (Crossway Bibles. (2008). The ESV Study Bible (p. 2348). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles)."
Matthew 24:1-51,"('Second Coming', ""Jesus' Second Coming"", 'Spectacular')",Baptist," ""Snapshots of the Second Coming"" Matthew 24:1-51 Matthew 24:36 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only. 37 But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. 38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, 39 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. 40 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. 41 Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. 42 Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. 43 But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. 44 Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh. 45 Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season? 46 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. 47 Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods. 48 But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; 49 And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; 50 The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, 51 And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Introduction: I think that it is fairly normal for those of us who are Christians to gradually change our focus as we get older. I have found that to be true in my own life and from my observations of my fellow believers that seems to be the case for them as well. I know this because of the Scriptures that we focus on and the songs and hymns that seem to enjoy. They both become more precious to us with the passage of the years. Squire Parsons singing, ""Beulah Land"" means a lot more to me today than it did say, 40 years ago and I can almost envision myself ""Camping In Canaan Land!"" Bryan Jay writes - ""Very often, when we speak of Christ's coming, the emphasis is on the particulars of the event, and we forget the person of the event. What makes the second coming so encouraging to us as believers is that it is JESUS who is coming. If Jesus isn't precious to us...if we fail to see his glory and the desirability of being in his bodily presence, then we will have missed the encouragement that we can receive by remembering that the glorious bridegroom of the church is coming back to earth."" Let's focus on the person of our soon coming Lord Jesus for these next few moments: I. His coming shall be secret vs 36, 42, 44 Oddly enough the first predictions of the Lord's coming occurred in about 500 AD and happened sporadically for several years afterwards, picking up steam until these announcements became quite regular from the 18 century onward till today! Let me give you just a few examples:"
Revelation 19:7-10,"('Bride Of Christ', 'Lamb Marriage Supper', 'Marriage Of The Lamb')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," The Marriage Supper of the Lamb Revelation 19:7-10 7Let us be glad and rejoice and give Him glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready."" 8And to her it was granted to be arrayed in fine linen, clean and bright, for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints. 9Then he said to me, ""Write: 'Blessed are those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb!' "" And he said to me, ""These are the true sayings of God."" 10And I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, ""See that you do not do that! I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."" As we continue our look at Revelation today we see the heavenly praise in Verses 1 through 6 continues. Chapters 4 through 18 have involved what happens during the 7 years of Tribulation. It didn't affect us because at that time we are in heaven. Either death or the Rapture removes us from those terrible times. Now we get to the part of Revelation that does involve us. The bride of Christ comes into the story. VERSE 7 Let us be glad and rejoice and give Him glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready."" This is a call for gladness, rejoicing and giving God glory for the marriage of the Lamb has come. The marriage of the Lamb takes place in heaven. The Church is in heaven prior to the return of Jesus to earth. Jesus is the Bridegroom at the marriage and His Church is the Bride. The word ""church"" appears 19 times in Revelation chapters 1, 2 and 3. It does not appear again until Revelation 22:16 indicating the absence of the Church from the earth during the judgments of Revelation chapters 4 through 18. The wife or bride of Christ is the church. The marriage is the eternal union of the church with Jesus following the Rapture. 1 Thessalonians 4:17 says, Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord. In ancient times, a marriage was the single greatest celebration and social event. Preparations and celebrations were elaborate. They were in 3 stages. First, there was the betrothal or engagement. This was an arrangement by both sets of parents. It was legally binding and could only be broken by divorce. Second was the presentation which was a time of celebrations. Those festivities could last up to a week and sometimes more. Third was the wedding ceremony during which time the vows were exchanged. The same imagery of a wedding picture's the Lord's relationship with His Church. VERSE 8 And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. The fine linen the bride is clothed in has been made white by the blood of the Lamb. This ""righteousness"" was not ours until we received the Lord Jesus into our lives and took on His righteousness. Our own righteousness had been as filthy rags, but Jesus replaced the filth with His righteousness."
1 Kings 13:1-33,"('Obedience To God', 'Divine Judgement')",Baptist," ""An old prophet lived in Bethel. And his sons came and told him all that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. They also told to their father the words that he had spoken to the king. And their father said to them, 'Which way did he go?' And his sons showed him the way that the man of God who came from Judah had gone. And he said to his sons, 'Saddle the donkey for me.' So they saddled the donkey for him and he mounted it. And he went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak. And he said to him, 'Are you the man of God who came from Judah?' And he said, 'I am.' Then he said to him, 'Come home with me and eat bread.' And he said, 'I may not return with you, or go in with you, neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place, for it was said to me by the word of the LORD, ""You shall neither eat bread nor drink water there, nor return by the way that you came.""' And he said to him, 'I also am a prophet as you are, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, ""Bring him back with you into your house that he may eat bread and drink water.""' But he lied to him. So, he went back with him and ate bread in his house and drank water. ""And as they sat at the table, the word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back. And he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, 'Thus says the LORD, ""Because you have disobeyed the word of the LORD and have not kept the command that the LORD your God commanded you, but have come back and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you, 'Eat no bread and drink no water,' your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.""' And after he had eaten bread and drunk, he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back. And as he went away a lion met him on the road and killed him. And his body was thrown in the road, and the donkey stood beside it; the lion also stood beside the body."" [1] ""How many men are you going to kill?"" I was taken aback when a sister asked this question in the week past. I was unclear concerning what she meant, but when I asked for clarification she indicated a desire to know more about the series of messages I am currently bringing. As you know, this current series of messages has been entitled, ""Men Whom God Killed."" Truthfully, time constraints and the need to address other issues restrict me from speaking of all the individuals recorded in the Word whom God killed. While I know that God is love, and while I am prepared to insist that ""love,"" selfless love, characterises both the Lord God and those who are born from above and into His Kingdom, I caution people that this loving God is holy. We must never forget that He is holy. After speaking of God's sentence against Israel's unbelief in the wilderness and the subsequent death of everyone over the age of twenty during the next forty years, the Apostle writes, ""These things took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as they did."" He then draws warnings from the examples of God's judgements, concluding, ""These things happened to them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction, on whom the end of the ages has come [see 1 CORINTHIANS 10:1-11]. Because these things--judgements, and even extreme judgements--were written down for our instruction, it is appropriate that we should study them so that we may be warned to avoid sinning against the Lord."
"Genesis 1:26-27, Genesis 2:7","('Restoration', 'Image Of God', 'Restoration By Grace', 'Image Restored')",Church Of God," Image of God Genesis 1:26-27 Genesis 2:7 Romans 5:12 James 3:9 Ephesians 4:24 Ephesians 2:8-9 II Corinthians 5:17 Intro: 26 Then God said, ""Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground."" 27 So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. As Christians, I think we can overlook this statement sometimes. ""WE WERE CREATED IN THE IMAGE OF GOD"". What does that mean? How does it affect us? How should we be different knowing that we were created in his image? I think we need to clear it up and get a deeper understanding of what it means to be made in the image of God. "" Something to notice about this scripture is that is says in our image. Our image being the image of not only God the father, but God the son (Jesus Christ) and the Holy Spirit. What does it mean? "" Being made in the image of God, means that he created us to be like him, and to be a reflection of him, which means we should act like a reflection of him. "" As humans, we are unique. We have a fleshly body, but also a spirit and soul. 7 Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being. "" God formed us, and breathed his breath of life in us, which means we have life because of the breath of God. We have life because of God's spirit. "" God directly created our fleshly body whenever he molded us from the dirt, and he directly created our soul and spirit whenever he breathed his breath of life in us. How does it affect us? "" We are like God mentally, and morally. o Mentally: ? We are created with the same emotions that God has. "" Love, righteous anger, jealousness, joy etc... "" Whenever we are experiencing emotions like this, we can directly correlate them to the emotions that God feels when he looks at us. "" Unrighteous anger, greed, hate etc... are not from God, these emotions entered the world when sin did. ? God also gave us reasoning and rationality. "" We are able to make choices for ourselves, and typically see what the outcome might be if we make the choices. o Morally: ? Mankind was originally created innocent, pure and without sin. "" Adam and Eve were created most closely resembling the image of God, because they were not subject to sickness, death, age, time, sin, etc... "" This was just in their initial creation though. Because of the mental side of humanity, they had freewill and had the ability to make the choice to screw things up. 12 Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned-- "" Even though Adam and Eve made the wrong moral choice, that wasn't a reflection of the image of God, the still reflected the image of God, from a mental standpoint, because they used freewill to make choices."
Acts 1:6-8,"(""Christ's Power"", 'Receive Power', 'Times Or The Seasons')",Baptist,cts 1.6," May 6, 2013 By: Tom Lowe Title: The Re-orientation to the Program Acts 1.6-8 (KJV) 6 When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? 7 And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. 8 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. Introduction We are informed by Matthew that Jesus prefaced the Great Commission by announcing, ""All authority in heaven and on earth is given to me."" It was, probably, this announcement that led to the inquiry which Luke mentions next. Being informed that all authority is now given to him, the disciples expected to see him begin to exercise it in the way they had long anticipated. Commentary Paul wrote, ""When they therefore were come together"" to make it clear that ALL the apostles were present when this question was asked, so that we may know that it did not come from only one or two of them, but that they all wanted to know about the state of the kingdom. It may cause us to wonder why they appear so ignorant of the subject, when they have been diligently instructed by the Lord for more than three years; it's as if they never heard a word. The question they put to Jesus was, ""Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? There are as many errors in this question as words, but it does contain two interesting facts: First, that the apostles still had a misconception of the nature of Christ's kingdom; second, that the kingdom was not yet established. Both these facts deserve some attention at this point, especially the latter. Their misconceptions consisted in the expectation that Christ would re-establish the earthly kingdom of Israel, and restore it to its ancient glory, under His own personal reign. In His reply, the Savior does not attempt to correct this misconception, but leaves it up to the enlightenment that was to be provided by the Holy Spirit. The expression ""kingdom of heaven"" is used only by Matthew. In the places where he uses this expression, the other three Gospel writers say ""kingdom of God."" This fact shows that the two expressions are equivalent. Explaining the former by the latter, we conclude that the ""kingdom of heaven"" is not heaven, but simply a kingdom of God, without regard to locality. This kingdom is also called by Christ his own, as the Son of man; since he says, ""There are some standing here who shall not taste of death till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom."" (Matthew 16:28). The Apostle Paul also speaks of the ""kingdom of God's dear Son,"" (Colossians 1:13); and He also says, ""He must reign till he has put all enemies under his feet"" (1 Corinthians 15:25)."
Matthew 5:38-48,"('Revenge',)",United Methodist," Matthew 5:38-48 A Radical thought on Revenge 1. This is How we look at revenge? We think its Love, but is it the Kind of love Jesus shows? "" We desire to see the evil doer put down because he drew first blood Sylvester Salon "" Who can forget Carrie (1976), based on the Stephen King novel, in which a bullied high school girl gets her revenge? "" Common way to respond to the wrong doer is we want him to bleed "" Roots Tobi runs away several times but he is always caught Tobi is caught taken to the whipping post chained down the slave keeper whips him with the whip telling him to say his name is Tobia Kunta Kinte he keeps responding. Kunta runs after he "" When we watch the movies we always want the evildoer put down. we see the person save himself, maybe they save their spouse, or save their children, maybe save their friends. Not only do we want the good guys saved but we want the evil doer to go down. 2. Jesus issues a radical Teaching about revenge it is ""LOVE "" Jesus rejected any kind of retaliatory violence ""You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,'"" says Jesus, pointing to the law of Moses,. "" Jesus wanted his disciples to reject revenge but he accepts the idea of redemption for both the offended and the offender. "" ""Do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also; and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat, give your cloak as well; and if anyone forces you to go one mile, go also the second mile"" (Matthew 5:38- 3. Jesus teaches us that Love does not retaliate. Talk about difficult "" ""If anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also,"" says Jesus -- demonstrate that you are a follower of the Prince of Peace (v. 39). "" ""[I]f anyone wants to sue you and take your coat, give your cloak as well"" -- show the world that you find your security in God, not in material possessions (v. 40). "" ""[I]f anyone forces you to go one mile, go also the second mile"" -- reveal your generosity by offering them more than they are demanding of you (v. 41). "" ""Give to everyone who begs from you, and do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you"" -- make a point of helping others as the Lord has helped you (v. 42). "" Love doesn't retaliate; instead, it seeks the welfare of the other person, even if that person is an evildoer. By responding with nonviolence, generosity and helpfulness, we stand a chance of leading someone closer to God's kingdom. "" Of course, such a Christ like response is difficult. It takes courage and deep determination. In Uganda, Angelina Atyam's daughter was abducted in 1996. According to Divinity magazine (Winter 2010), rebel troops took her and 29 other girls from a Catholic boarding school. Angelina met weekly with the parents of the other girls to pray for their daughters' release. ""I was confused, bitter and very deep in my heart I was thinking, 'How do I avenge this?'"" says Angelina. ""Yet we continued to pray and call upon the [rebels] to release our children, protect them, bring them home and make peace again."""
Matthew 5:43-48,"('Forgiveness', 'Anger', 'Forgive Your Enemy')",Baptist," Matthew 5:43-48 Love without Limits Did you know your body is not designed to carry anger for very long? Now don't get me wrong: anger is a helpful emotion. It tells you something is terribly wrong. But God designed your body to resolve anger as quickly as possible and to move on. Resentment and bitterness eat at our soul. They cause our bodies to age prematurely. So how can we get better at forgiving our enemies and even wishing them well? That's what Jesus addresses next in his famous Sermon on the Mount. He starts by quoting the common thought of the day, a strange combination of scripture and custom. He says, in verse 43, ""You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'"" Well, the first part--""love your neighbor""--is straight from scripture. Way back in Leviticus 19:18, part of the Jewish Torah, the first five books of the Bible considered most sacred and honored, God says, ""Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against anyone among your people, but love your neighbor as yourself."" Jesus later quotes this as one of the two greatest commandments: to love God and to love your neighbor as yourself (Matthew 22:36-40). This is right from God. But the second half of the phrase, ""Hate your enemy"" - you won't find in scripture. It's not there. I looked! About the closest you'll find is part of a psalm of David, Psalm 139:21-22: ""Do I not hate those who hate you, Lord, and abhor those who are in rebellion against you? I have nothing but hatred for them; I count them my enemies."" Here David is using the pledge of loyalty customary for a king of that time period: ""Your friend is my friend, and your enemy is my enemy."" He is saying, God comes first. But the lead religious people of Jesus' day had taken this verse and run with it to conveniently suggest, ""Love those who love you, and hate those who hate you."" Or, ""Love people who are just like you, and feel free to hate people who are different from you."" They were mixing their own natural desires and feelings with what God's word says, which prompted Jesus at another time to address who exactly is our neighbor? The answer: anyone in need. Think the story of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:29-37). In our passage today, Jesus says, ""Let me show you God's intent: that you love everyone, including your enemies."" Now I heard about a pastor who was preaching on this text, and he took a survey and said, ""How many of you have enemies?"" Well, practically the whole church raised their hands. Then he said, ""Is there anyone who has no enemies at all?"" One hand went up in the back. And the pastor called on the old man and said, ""Well done, sir! How is it that you have not a single enemy?"" The old man responded, ""I outlived them all!"" Well, that's not the only way to work your way out of enemies. Jesus gives us some tips here. First, in verse 44, he says, ""Pray for them!"" In one of my churches I had a person that crossed me at every turn. It got worse and worse. Now I'm not recommending this kind of prayer, but I prayed, ""Lord, this guy's had a full life. Why don't you bring him home? He's not serving any good on this earth anymore."" That's not exactly a prayer that will move you toward reconciliation. (And I promise not to pray that for you!) But you know, God takes us where we are. And thank God, he doesn't leave us there. Over time, I was able to soften my prayers for this person and to realize that a lot of his hateful actions came from his poor health and his broken family relationships with his adult kids, and I actually came to pity him, to feel some compassion, which is a true sign that forgiveness is taking root. And praise God, we later parted on peaceful terms."
Acts 3:19,"('Repentance', 'Sanctification', 'Sanctified Living')",Baptist," REPENTANCE SERIES Online Sermon: http://www.mckeesfamily.com/?page_id=3567 We started off this series by talking sin and the character of God. When we sin, we become distant from God because He is pure light and there is no darkness in Him at all. We learned that repentance is the mechanism that God has given us to be forgiven and have our relationship with Him restored. Even with this mechanism we remain distant from God because we do not know how to repent God's way. For instance, In the second week we identified seven myths concerning repentance. It is a myth that motivations such as sorrow, preservation, penance, reformation, self-deception, selective and no consequence; lead to repentance. Last week we explored ten of the most common impediments to repentance and then finished off by describing seven key motivating factors of a truly repentant heart. The focus of this week's sermon is to summarize what we have learned thus far by outlining six crucial steps of a Biblical model of repentance. . PART 4: SIX BIBLICAL STEPS OF REPENTANCE Acts 3:19 Repentance is a gift of God's grace whereby the sinner is inwardly humbled and visibly transformed to meet God's righteous standards both in word, thought and deed. There are six steps to repent God's way: sight of sin, sorrow for sin, confession of sin, shame of sin, hatred of sin and turning away from sin. For most people, each one of these steps become progressively more difficult. For example, identifying sin in one's life tends not to be as difficult as sorrow, confession, shame or hatred of sin. The final and most difficult step in repenting is the actual turning away from sin because it requires lasting change in a person's life. The section below will look at each of these steps in more detail starting with the sight of sin. STEP ONE: SIGHT OF SIN Since the first thing God made was light (Genesis 1:3) so is the first thing in repenting, illuminating one's sin. While it is easy to spot the ""plank"" in another's eye (Matthew 7:5) it is not so easy to humble oneself to see within one's own life. The veil of ignorance or self-love keeps many from identifying their own unrighteousness. While this veil cannot be removed by human effort alone, He who knit you in your mother's womb and knows everything about you (Psalms 139) can enable you to identify those areas of your life that do not conform to God's holiness. In the story of the Prodigal Son it was not until he came to his senses (Luke 15:18) and acknowledged that he had sinned against the Father that his journey of forgiveness began. So crucial is this first step that Paul warns those who do not examine and identify sin in their lives risk eating and drinking judgment upon themselves at the Lord's Table (1 Corinthians 11:28). ""Sin must be first identified before it can be wept for."" Spirit led, self-examination of sin is best done in solitude, meditation and prayer. STEP 2: SORROW FOR SIN The second step in repentance is to experience deep sorrow for having offended the very character of God. Sorrow for having sinned is not a superficial emotion that is here one day and gone the next but is best described as broken (Psalms 51:17) or rending of the heart (Joel 2:13) that outwardly manifests itself through actions such as the smiting of the thigh (Jeremiah 31:19), knocking of the breast (Luke 18:13), putting on sackcloth (Isaiah 22:12) or plucking off the hair (Ezra 9:3). In his book The Doctrine of Repentance, Thomas Watson identifies six qualifications of sorrow that leads to repentance:"
"Matthew 28:19-20, 2 Corinthians 3:17-18","('Discipler', 'Reproduce', 'Disciple')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," February 12 Sermon - The Way of Jesus # 6 'I am helping someone and someone is helping me to be a reproducing follower of Jesus. We've been walking through the markers of the Way of Jesus as a general introduction to some of the concepts within the Way of Jesus. This past Wednesday many of us gathered along with guests from elsewhere to share a meal and to experience an introductory session of the actual Way of Jesus platform. It took what we have been looking at over these past weeks and introduced us to the Way of Jesus Sessions which begin one Saturday a month starting on April 8. At those Saturday sessions we will look at the Way of Jesus platform at a much deeper level, bringing these concepts into a sense of community to work them out. We were never called to work the Christian life out on our own, but rather within the body of Christ. The Way of Jesus is an amazing opportunity for spiritual growth. I need it. I hope you will join us. Here are the markers we have looked at over the past number of weeks: 1. I have begun following Jesus and I am depending on the Spirit of Jesus for my journey"" 2. I Am Being Sent by Jesus to Bless Others and Invite Them to Follow Him"". 3. I am Becoming Like Jesus in My Attitudes, Behaviour and Character"" 4. I am learning to love God and love others 5. I am learning the teachings of Jesus Today, the Way of Jesus marker we will look at is: ""I am helping someone and someone is helping me to be a reproducing follower of Jesus"". You might ask, how is this, why is this a part of the Way of Jesus. And you may wonder about the word ""reproducing"". Well, let me explain. Jesus gave the church, which is all believers, the Great Commission: In Matthew 28, after His crucifixion and His resurrection, Jesus is talking to his disciples and he says: 19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."" We're called to ""go"". We're called to ""make disciples"". What's a disciple? A student of Jesus, a follower of Jesus. The New Testament uses the word disciple not only of Jesus' followers but also those who followed Moses (John 9:28), the Pharisees (Mark 2:18), John the Baptist (Mark 11:2) and of Paul (Acts 9:25). A Disciple is one who has a desire to learn from His Master. A Disciple is a learner - One that attaches himself to a given teacher. The original word was used first of those that learned a trade under a master teacher. If you wanted to become a craftsman in a certain trade in biblical times you would apprentice yourself under the discipline and instruction of a master craftsman of that trade. There can be a difference between being a student and being a disciple. A student may learn things from his teacher, but not fully believe those teachings. Whereas a disciple fully believes and acts upon those teachings. The teacher and writer Soren Kierkegaard once said ""To become an 'admirer of Jesus' is much easier than to become a follower."""
Matthew 5:13-48,"('Faith', 'Second Mile', 'Travelers', 'Faith And Courage')",Episcopal," This sermon was delivered at Holy Trinity, Ayr, Ayrshire, Scotland on Sunday the 19th February 2017; Holy Trinity is a Scottish Episcopal Church in the Dioceses of Glasgow and Dumfries. The readings for today are from: Leviticus 19:1-2,9-18 1 Corinthians 3:10-11,16-23 Matthew 5:38-48 Psalm 119:33-40 Please join me in a short prayer from Psalms 19:14, ""Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of our hearts, be acceptable in your sight, O Lord, my strength, and my redeemer. Amen. Introduction. Back in the day, ... that is, when Jesus walked this earth as a man, a Roman solder, under imperial Roman law could demand or command that a Jewish man, (or boy), too carry his load or burden for up to one mile. ... This is true, a Roman soldier was allowed to approach any Jew and say, ""hei you, come ere, caary these bags fir me"". ... He probably didn't say it in a Maybole accent, but he would say it in an authoritative, bulling, dismissive tone. Now this seems all very good for the Roman soldiers, but it was not as cut and dry as it appears; because the Jews really resented being treated and humiliated in this way, and so the Jews, being a Jews, sticking rigidly to the law, carried the soldiers burden for one mile ... but not one step further. ... This then would sort of annoy the Roman soldier, because he then needed to look for another Jew to carry his load further, and this in some way gave the Jews a wee bit of satisfaction, enabling them to sneer a bit, ... because by this time, every other Jews would have seen him carrying this burden, and so they would all stay well clear knowing full well that the Roman soldier would be looking for another Jew to carry his load further. But all in all, it was still in the soldiers favour, and the Jews absolutely hated this law, ... but they had hope ... they had a plan, a cunning plan, because a Messiah was soon to appear, and he would sort out these Romans, ... but when Jesus did appear, he said on the ""Sermon on the Mount"", (verse 41), ""And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him two"". Can you imagine the Jews reaction on hearing that, ""you want us to go two miles ... you are not on ... stuff that ... you caary it two miles"". Ok, they did not have Ayrshire accents either, but I bet you that was said, ... and seriously that is not what they expected from this greatly prophesied messiah; ... they expected a true political hero, a champion of champions, and not one who would appease the Romans and help them with their cause. But, do you remember in my sermon from a few weeks ago when I quoted 1st Corinthians 1:18 which read, ""For the preaching of the cross to them that perish, is foolishness; ... but unto us which are saved, ... it is the power of God"". Well this is a case in point, you see, Jesus knew what he was saying, ... he knew that these civilised law abiding Jews were no match for these tough, battle hardened Roman soldiers. You see these soldiers would have had fire in their bellies, they would have a spirit of aggression, authority and intimidation ... and if any poor Jew challenged that spirit, ... (with their own defiant spirit), then obviously, the Roman soldier would win, and everyone knew this."
Psalms 66:8-20,"('Fiery Trials', ""God's Deliverance"", ""God's Works"", 'Trials', 'Testifying')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," A TESTIMONY OF ANSWERED PRAYER Psalm 66:8-20 ""O bless our God, ye peoples"" (Psalm 66:8) is an appeal being made by the congregation of God's people to all the peoples of all the lands of all the earth (Psalm 66:1; cf. Psalm 100:1). This is evangelism which puts God first. It is not about us, it is not about you, it is about Him. ""Let the sound of His praise be heard"" (Psalm 66:8) gives permission to the church to harness all this world's media for the furtherance of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. Tell the world to tell others: this stuff is good! This word is for you, and you, and you: pass it on! We stand with the Apostle Paul on Mars Hill in Athens, recognizing with him the universal truth which he quotes from the Greek poets: 'in Him we live, and move, and have our being' (Acts 17:28). The Psalmist says much the same thing: ""He holds our soul in life"" (Psalm 66:9). But for the Christian there is more: ""He does not allow our feet to slip."" How is it that the congregation of God's people can be so sure of this? Well, they have been tried like silver, and come through the furnace with their faith intact (Psalm 66:10; cf. Deuteronomy 4:20). For our encouragement, we should listen to Job 23:10 - 'He knows the way that I take, and when He has tried me I shall come forth as gold.' Israel went through the ""fire"" of affliction, and through the ""water"" of the Red Sea. The LORD has delivered us, not only from the tyranny of sin and of death (""men riding over our heads""), but also into ""a spacious place"": the fullness of new life in Christ Jesus (Psalm 66:11-12; cf. Psalm 66:6). The testimony of the people of God is supplemented with the testimony of one believer: like a good old-fashioned evangelistic meeting, which not only has good preaching, but also individual testimonies to follow. The voice of the one rises above the song of the congregation: ""I will go to your house... I will pay my vows, which I made when I was in trouble"" (Psalm 66:13-14). The burnt offerings (Psalm 66:15) indicate the whole-heartedness of this believer's commitment to the LORD. The choir had sung, 'Come and see the works of God' (Psalm 66:5) - but this individual personalises it: ""Come and hear... what God has done for me!"" (Psalm 66:16). The Psalmist had been in trouble (Psalm 66:14), he cried to God (Psalm 66:17), and God ""attended to the voice of my prayer"" (Psalm 66:19). Key to this success in prayer, indicates the Psalmist, was the state of his heart toward God: he cherished not iniquity in his heart (Psalm 66:18). The Psalm ends as it began: by blessing God. For, ""He has not turned away my prayer, nor removed His mercy/ loving kindness from me"" (Psalm 66:20). Many Christians can relate to this testimony in their own experience - why not share it with others?"
1 Chronicles 28:1-10,"('David', 'Solomon')",*other," An ancient Chassidic parable tells the story of Yechiel, the young grandson of a Chassidic rabbi, who once played hide-and-seek with a friend. When it was his turn to hide, he found a great hiding place where he waited, somewhat impatiently, for his friend to find him. He waited and waited; it seemed like hours--but his friend never came. In fact, his friend had never even started looking for him. He'd left the little boy and gone home. With tears streaming down his face, Yechiel ran to his grandfather and told him what had happened. Deeply moved by the hurt of his grandson, the rabbi also broke into tears saying, ""God says the same thing: 'I hide, but no one tries to find me.'"" I. INTRODUCTION 1. I hide, but no one tries to find me. When you hear that statement, you probably think, ""God makes himself available to everybody, He doesn't hide!"" Your problem (mine, too), is that you think like a 21st century Gentile... 2. In ancient Jewish thought, God reveals himself only to those who seek him: in particular priests, prophets and others God specifically calls. They believe God hides himself from pagan nations because he does not wish to reveal himself to them. 3. Consequently, the Jews focus much of their theology on seeking God's face (some believe this phrase is a reference to his ""hiding""). Our goal is not to adopt their belief, but to understand it, and gain a new appreciation for Jewish thought as it relates to OT writings.

In this passage the Chronicler records David's plans for the building of the temple of the Lord, and his final instructions to his son Solomon. 2. David concedes that he will not build the temple for YAHWEH his God, despite his deep desire to do so (v.2). If you've experienced the loss of a dream, you understand David's disappointment. He masks his regret (like us) with some positive self-affirmation (4-7): A. YAHWEH, the God of Israel chose me to be king; first Judah, then my family, then me! B. Among my sons, he has chosen Solomon to be king of the kingdom of the Lord. C. Solomon, my son, will build the temple; he will be the LORD's son D. His kingdom will last forever if he is uncompromising in carrying out the law of God. 3. David's self-affirmation is not pride, but duty to bless the LORD. Israel's understanding is that God showers goodness on them, and they respond in praise, worship, submission and obedience. 4. Following his challenge to the children of Israel (v8) to live in strict obedience to the laws and commandments of YAHWEH, he turns to Solomon in a beautifully passionate moment, and gives him this emotional instruction (v9): A. And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with a whole heart and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches all hearts and understands every plan and thought. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever. B. NIV acknowledge is unfortunate--should probably be translated know. Also, heart is not the organ or emotion, but inner midst of the will--the center of conscious decision (cf. mind, brain)"
"Deuteronomy 18:18-22, 1 Samuel 13:8-14","('Old Testament', 'History', 'Prophets')",Christian/Church Of Christ," What do you think of when you see the word Prophet? If you look at the online Merriam-Webster Dictionary you get the following definitions. 1. one who utters divinely inspired revelations, such as: a. the writer of one of the prophetic books of the Bible b. one regarded by a religious group as the final authoritative revealer of God's will 2. one gifted with more than ordinary spiritual and moral insight; especially: an inspired poet 3. one who foretells future events Did any of those fit the picture you had in your mind? Some people have the idea that prophets, especially Bible prophets, were wild fanatics dressed in strange clothes. Others imagine wizard-like sages peering into crystal balls. It would be fair to say that many of us misunderstand exactly who the prophets were and what they did. As we spend the next several weeks look at some of the OT Prophets I want us to remember that in the biblical sense, a prophet was someone specially prepared by God for a very special ministry. They brought divine words to people who desperately needed to hear it. Even though they lived many years ago and were speaking to a group of people who are no longer here, I believe their words are still valuable to us today and we can see the present day applications of the messages they delivered. In Deuteronomy 18:18-22 (NASB) we see God speak to Moses concerning those who prophecy in the name of the LORD. 18 I will raise up a prophet from among their countrymen like you, and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him. 19 It shall come about that whoever will not listen to My words which he shall speak in My name, I Myself will require it of him. 20 But the prophet who speaks a word presumptuously in My name which I have not commanded him to speak, or which he speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet shall die.' 21 You may say in your heart, 'How will we know the word which the Lord has not spoken?' 22 When a prophet speaks in the name of the Lord, if the thing does not come about or come true, that is the thing which the Lord has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously; you shall not be afraid of him. God took the idea of prophecy seriously and He expected those called to do the same. He also expected those receiving the words of a prophet to listen and obey. Notice, the prophet who abused his calling was worthy of death. God also told those hearing that they could be sure and know when a prophet was speaking His words. How? They always came true. That was the test of a true prophet. There are three Hebrew words used to refer to a prophet: hozeh, ro'eh, and nabi. The OT uses these words interchangeably but they do have slightly different meanings. The first two (hozeh and ro'eh) come from root words that mean ""to see, gaze, or look on."" These individuals saw the very things of God. God Himself gave these people special insight. Some English translations will use the word ""seer"" when these are used. The third word (nabi) is the one used most in the OT (over 300 times). It carries the connotation of one who has been ""called"" by God to deliver a divine message to the people."

Your ""fullness"" will determine what overflows to every area of your life. And yet the truth is that if we find ourselves closer to the ""e"" than the ""f"" we are in the majority. In a recent study of 1,000 churches and the spiritual growth of their congregation the researchers discovered that only 11% (or in other words 1 out of 10) would say they are compelled by their faith to love God and love others! 89% in the wilderness. Saved? Yes. Full? No! Emptiness reigns in the church community. However, I want to remind you and challenge you that God does intend for us to be full! I am going to continue to read these because they are promises that we must allow to come to life in our spirit - not just for my neighbor but for me. John 10:10 The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that _________ (insert your name) may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance - to the full, till it overflows.

For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form, and in Christ you have been brought to fullness. The accurate and mature understanding is knowing that salvation was only part of the picture. He came to save but He also came to enable us to experience fullness in life! So I want to clearly state for us some of the things that should fill us so that we are able to experience this fullness that Jesus came to give us. I have declared that we must be thank full, purpose full, grace full, and prayer full. I want us to continue on this path to fullness. Today I want to draw your attention to 4 identical statements all made in Matthew. While I read these 4 instances I also want you to take notice to whom this statement was made! Matthew 6:28-30 (NKJV) 28 ""So why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; 29 and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 30 Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? (Stop here just a moment before we read the other 3 and say this instance is different in that He uses this ""o you of little faith"" not as an indictment but as the given or understood condition of His audience.) Matthew 8:18, 23-27 (NKJV) And when Jesus saw great multitudes about Him, He gave the command to depart to the other side. (Luke says He says Let's go to the other side!) 23 Now when He got into a boat, His disciples followed Him. 24 And suddenly a great tempest arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves. But He was asleep. 25 Then His disciples came to Him and awoke Him, saying, ""Lord, save us! We are perishing!"" 26 But He said to them, ""Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?"" Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. 27 So the men marveled, saying, ""Who can this be, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?"""

I have declared that we must be thank full, purpose full, grace full, prayer full, and faith full. I want us to continue on this path to fullness. Today will require you to be truth full about your own spiritual life. It may be the most challenging of these messages not because Scripture doesn't back this level of fullness that I will call you to today. Rather we have become so incredibly comfortable with living empty of this level of life that we have grown tolerant of excuses and given ourselves exemptions in this area. Even though we read the New Testament which is full of accounts of fullness we embrace emptiness because we also know that with great power comes great responsibility and we don't want the responsibility. However, how many parents in the room know that just because you act like you are not responsible doesn't mean you aren't held accountable for that responsibility? We need to talk about this because we are accountable for this! It is time to push for and fight for this level of fullness in spite of our own doubts and excuses. John 14:11-14 (Message) ""Believe me: I am in my Father and my Father is in me. If you can't believe that, believe what you see - these works. (Interesting Jesus validates who He was by what He did.) The person who trusts me will not only do what I'm doing but even greater things, because I, on my way to the Father, am giving you the same work to do that I've been doing. You can count on it. From now on, whatever you request along the lines of who I am and what I am doing, I'll do it. That's how the Father will be seen for who He is in the Son. (Wait a minute read that line again. How will the Father be seen?) I mean it. Whatever you request in this way, I'll do."
Matthew 5:38-48,"('Hospitality', 'Perfect In Christ', 'Welcoming', 'Loving Enemies')",Lutheran," In 1979, Tim Hansel published a book entitled ""When I Relax I feel Guilty"". Included in the book is this raw and provocative tidbit. ""I would like to buy three dollars' worth of God, please. Not enough to explode my soul or disturb my sleep, but just enough to equal a cup of warm milk or a snooze in the sunshine. I don't want enough of Him to make me love a black man or pick beets with a migrant. I want ecstasy, not transformation; I want the warmth of the womb, not a new birth. I want a pound of the Eternal in a paper sack. I would like to buy three dollars' worth of God, please."" As we work our way through the Sermon on the Mount during these weeks of Epiphany, Jesus says some things that make us uncomfortable. ""Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you"" is one of those things. If we just select three dollars' worth of God, we can skip over these things, but, as Jesus explains, anyone can do that; we are called to do better. In fact, his exact words are, ""Be perfect."" During my ecumenical meetings with in Florida, we spent a lot of time talking about immigration and refugees because we were all from denominations with long histories of assisting those who come to this country with little or nothing, often fleeing for their lives. Maria, an Episcopalian priest from Pennsylvania, serves a small parish that is totally committed to refugee resettlement. She told us the way it works for them: she would receive a phone call, and the parish would have 48 hours to fill an empty apartment with furniture, bedding, dishes, food, clothing - everything the new family would need to get started. Then another agency would help that family, and they would wait for the next phone call. In most cases, her congregation never met the new neighbors they were assisting. Maria also served on the Episcopal-Mennonite dialogue and, through that connection, had offered her congregation these signs from the Mennonite denomination which read, in three languages, ""no matter where you are from, we're glad you're our neighbor."" [omitted instructions about how to get a sign.] Signs like this one are part of a movement called ""radical hospitality."" The concepts aren't new - they come from the Bible - but the awakening that we need to welcome and be hospitable comes at the same time that we began to realize that the world has been changing. It is no longer ""open your church doors, and the world will come to you"" but rather ""go out and be the church in your neighborhood"". The United Methodist Church has worked with this concept for many years. They say: ""Radical hospitality"" requires intentional invitation and welcome. It goes beyond greeters at the door and handshakes during worship to welcome every person as an honored guest. [from the UMC website] As individuals and as church together, we are great at radical social ministry and radical mission support. As attested by our Sunday School's sponsorship of a whole barnyard of animals and our donations to cover Junior [omitted]'s funeral, we are radically generous. But for those traveling on 13th Street, there are simply a bunch of beautiful church buildings with different architecture and different names and nothing to let those passing by know that strangers are welcome here. The Mennonite signs got me thinking and, with the Council's permission, we're going to get a sign to make certain that people know that they will be radically welcomed in this place. Watch for it to appear this week!"
Micah 6:1-8,"('Mercy', 'Humility', 'Justice', 'Kindness')",Lutheran," In the marathon subculture, T-shirts are everything. As a runner, you become a billboard for 26 miles, or 13, or 6, or in my case 3 miles. When I participated in my first 5K, I had to wear the shirt provided by my gym (since they paid the registration fee), but most of the time, each runner chooses. At the Sedona Turkey Trot, a wore a T-shirt which pictured a woman wearing a robe and stole with the caption, ""Girls can't what?!"" One of the men in the race was wearing a shirt that was blank on the front, but on the back it said, ""I am 50 years old, have type 2 diabetes, am 75 pounds overweight, and am ahead of you!"" Oh, how I wanted a shirt like that! In one 5K, I wore a shirt with words from our First Lesson, ""Act Justly, Love Kindness, and Walk Humbly."" Even in Sedona, where Christianity is not the majority, I received a lot of compliments, because, whether or not you believe in God, or whether you know that it is a quotation from an Old Testament prophet, it's a great slogan. The time when our lesson from Micah was written was a tense time. Yet another covenant had been broken, and the nation of Israel was on trial. At the beginning of the reading, we are told that the mountains and the hills are the witnesses of what the people had done (again). God had been there for them, but they had forgotten. When things were going well, they were no longer praising God and telling God's story. In choosing not to remember their own struggles leading up to liberation, the people grew complacent, apathetic. They had become a people willing to bargain, to bribe, even trying to buy off God. They talk among themselves as they cleverly come up with a calculated scheme. ""With what shall I come before the Lord?' (In other words, with what shall I buy off God.) ""Surely God will take my burnt offerings, my young calves. Certainly God will be pleased with thousands of rams, ten thousands of rivers of oil, my firstborn for my transgressions."" To that, Micah eloquently responds, ""What does the Lord require?"" Or maybe it is more in his prophetic voice, ""HELLO?! Can you hear me now? Are you paying attention at all? God has already told you what is required. Get a clue."" His desperation doesn't translate well from Hebrew to English, but it's there. We miss this when we just read verse 8. That's the verse that gets printed on those t-shirts and coffee mugs and Facebook posts. When we take that verse out of context, we make it sound like a sweet half-time commercial voiced by a twenty-something famous actor with a full orchestra accompanying him. They are beautiful stirring words, and there's nothing wrong with following them, but Micah was a radical prophet. He took the messages from Amos and Hosea and Isaiah and made them timeless, but he's screaming at the top of his lungs to people who have forgotten God and their promises to God, and they're not paying very close attention. It was the 8th Century BC, and Micah was a small town boy who spoke for the poor farm workers who were suffering at the hands of the land owners. When he saw injustice, he courageously named it, risking everything because he was not in a place of power but rather right in the midst of the situation. Most leaders of the time were focused on their own comfort and power. Because of that, Micah knew that justice would not come from the state or the structure in power. Real justice must arise out of the people themselves as they face the choice of either heading down the path toward the end or daring to envision change and then gathering the strength and courage to make it happen. Much as it is a T-shirt slogan, ""doing justice"" isn't a romantic ideal or an abstract concept. It is also almost never an individual pursuit. Mother Teresa was the exception, not the rule. Justice requires that we work together."
2 Corinthians 4:1-10,"('Spiritual Darkness', 'Storms In Life', 'Eclipse Of The Soul')",Christian/Church Of Christ," ""The Sun Will Shine Again!"" 2 Corinthians 4:1-10 David P. Nolte One thing we appreciated about south-central Oregon was the clear skies. It would cloud up and snow and then the sky would be blue and clear and the day would be Sunny. It has been said that life is like that - storms and Sunshine; dark nights and Sunshine. And what most people like best is SunSHINE! God is eager to shine light into our lives. The scripture says, ""Therefore, since God in his mercy has given us this new way, we never give up. We reject all shameful deeds and underhanded methods. We don't try to trick anyone or distort the word of God. We tell the truth before God, and all who are honest know this. If the Good News we preach is hidden behind a veil, it is hidden only from people who are perishing. Satan, who is the god of this world, has blinded the minds of those who don't believe. They are unable to see the glorious light of the Good News. They don't understand this message about the glory of Christ, who is the exact likeness of God. You see, we don't go around preaching about ourselves. We preach that Jesus Christ is Lord, and we ourselves are your servants for Jesus' sake. For God, who said, 'Let there be light in the darkness,' has made this light shine in our hearts so we could know the glory of God that is seen in the face of Jesus Christ. We now have this light shining in our hearts, but we ourselves are like fragile clay jars containing this great treasure. This makes it clear that our great power is from God, not from ourselves. We are pressed on every side by troubles, but we are not crushed. We are perplexed, but not driven to despair. We are hunted down, but never abandoned by God. We get knocked down, but we are not destroyed. Through suffering, our bodies continue to share in the death of Jesus so that the life of Jesus may also be seen in our bodies."" 2 Corinthians 4:1-10 (NLT). THE SUN WILL SHINE AGAIN. IT WILL SHINE: I. SUPERSEDING THE DARKEST NIGHT A. ""We are pressed on every side by troubles; We are perplexed;. We are hunted down; We get knocked down."" Those things make for dark nights! Sometimes in the Bible, 1. Darkness is used to illustrate sin or evil. John wrote, ""This is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. But he who practices the truth comes to the Light, so that his deeds may be manifested as having been wrought in God."" John 3:19-21 (NASB). 2. Darkness is used to represent God's chastening with the purpose of securing repentance. We read, ""Then the LORD said to Moses, 'Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even a darkness which may be felt.' So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and there was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days."" Exodus 10:21-22 (NASB)."
1 Corinthians 3:5-9,"('Salvation', 'Obedience', 'Spiritual Gifts', 'Diversity')",Baptist," The Benefit of Diversity 1 Corinthians 3: 5-9 As we continue our series - Church: A New Testament Model, I was reminded of the various gifts and abilities within the church. Every believer is gifted of the Spirit for service within the body of Christ, and yet all are not gifted the same. This stands to reason, and our Lord, through His infinite wisdom, has gifted and placed individuals within the body as it pleased Him. Paul was well aware of the great need and benefit for diversity within the church. In order for her to function effectively, she needed a diversity of gifts. 1 Cor.12:14 - For the body is not one member, but many. 1 Cor.12:18-20 - But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him. [19] And if they were all one member, where were the body? [20] But now are they many members, yet but one body. He encouraged and promoted diversity within the church, especially regarding spiritual gifts. The church was ordained of Christ our Lord, being His body. He created a sovereign design for the church that included a wide variety of gifts and abilities. In order for us to prosper, we too must recognize and embrace the need for diversity within the church. I want to examine the certainties within our text as we consider: The Benefit of Diversity. I. The Challenge in Diversity (5) - Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? Paul was convinced of the benefit of diversity within the church, and he was also aware of the challenges it presented. Consider: A. The Tendency of the Flesh (5a) - Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos? While ministering in Corinth, a dispute regarding loyalty and leadership became apparent. Some had been led to the Lord through the ministry of Paul, and others through the work of Apollos. No doubt some favored the personality and approach to ministry of one over the other. A division among the people had developed over which preacher to follow. This division was not caused by differences in doctrine, but largely through preferences and personalities. These tendencies remain in the church today. Many divisions have formed within the church primarily over preferences and individual personalities. Some favor one leader or worker, and others favor someone else. As we will discover, this is not pleasing to the Lord and it only creates a hindrance within the church. The scope of our vision is not centered on individuals within the church, but following the will of God and His plan for our lives. B. The Reality of our Faith (5b) - Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? Paul urged the people to consider their actions. There was nothing special or supernatural about him or Apollos. They were both just men, called of God to minister to the church. If the people were focused, or depending upon Paul or Apollos instead of the Lord, they had missed it. They were mere mortals, seeking to be used of God in ministry. The loyalty of the people needed to be toward the Lord, not men."
John 4:4-30,"('Woman At Well', 'Deity Of Jesus')",Assembly Of God," SHE LEFT HER WATERPOT John 4:4-30 INTRODUCTION A. HUMOR: DISASTER STRIKES TWICE 1. A cruise liner was blown off course by a hurricane and sank in the Pacific and the shipwrecked passengers swam to an island inhabited by cannibals. Only 3 passengers survived the shipwreck and they all happened to be members of the same church - Pastor Smith, Sister Strange, and Chuck Wagon. They were pulled from the water and brought before the chief of the cannibals. 2. ""We're looking forward to eating the three of you,"" he said, ""but before we do, it's our custom to grant you a last request. So each of you tell me what you would like to do before you die."" 3. Chuck Wagon, who sings alternately off-key and screeching, said, ""I want to sing the 2 hour version of the MESSIAH musical. I've always wanted to sing it, but the Pastor wouldn't let me. I would like to sing it here, before I die."" The chief said, ""Granted."" 4. Sister Strange said, ""I want to tell - without being interrupted - about all the sicknesses I've ever had in my body. I've wanted to tell them all at church, but the Pastor wouldn't let me. So even if it takes 3 hours, I want to tell them all before I die."" ""OK, granted,"" said the cannibal leader. 5. He turned to the Pastor and said, ""And what about you? What do you want?"" The Pastor replied, ""I request to be eaten first, before they sing and recite!"" B. TEXT 4 Now he had to go through Samaria. 5 So [Jesus] came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph. 6 Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about noon. 7 When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, ""Will you give me a drink?"" 8 (His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.) 9 The Samaritan woman said to him, ""You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?"" (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.) 10 Jesus answered her, ""If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water."" 11 ""Sir,"" the woman said, ""you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? 12 Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his livestock?"" 13 Jesus answered, ""Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, 14 but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life."" 15 The woman said to him, ""Sir, give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water."" 16 He told her, ""Go, call your husband and come back."" 17 ""I have no husband,"" she replied. Jesus said to her, ""You are right when you say you have no husband. 18 The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true."" 19 ""Sir,"" the woman said, ""I can see that you are a prophet."" John 4:5-19. 25 The woman said, ""I know that Messiah"" (called Christ) ""is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us."" 26 Then Jesus declared, ""I...speaking to you...am he."" 28 Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, 29 ""Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?"" 30 They came out of the town and made their way toward him."

According to my research, the American flag on church stages became a prominent feature somewhere around WWI. And it especially came into prominence during WWII when (according to a Catholic resource) the flag was flown on stage to help people remember those who died in the war. What I want you to do this morning is to stand with me and recite the pledge of allegiance. ""I Pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America And to the Republic for which it stands. One nation, under God, indivisible. With liberty and justice for all."" (See note #1 at the end of the sermon) To pledge Allegiance is to make a Declaration of Loyalty to someone or something. A few years back John Rigle (a previous preacher here) wrote an interesting pledge of allegiance: ""I pledge allegiance to the Lamb, the only begotten Son of God. He is the Messiah, the Lord of Lords, the King of Kings. He is Immanuel, God with us. He is Jesus. He is omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent and yet He is in my heart. He is the Lion and the Lamb. I pledge allegiance to my Savior, Jesus. The great I AM."" I pledge allegiance to the Lamb. That is where my loyalty lies. Jesus is my Lord and King... And more than that, He's my Lord of Lords and King of Kings. Now, you can be a Christian not be an American. You did know that didn't you? You can be from Australia, South Africa, France - any number of nations across the globe - and still be a Christian. And you can be an American and not say the pledge of allegiance to the flag. (That annoys me a lot when folks refuse to do that... but they DON'T have to). So you can be a Christian not be an American. And you can still be an American and not say the pledge of allegiance. But you cannot be a Christian if you do NOT pledge your allegiance to Jesus. If your loyalty is not with Jesus... you're not a Christian. Jesus said: ""I am the way, and the truth, and the life. NO ONE comes to the Father EXCEPT THROUGH ME."" John 14:6 If Jesus is NOT our Lord and King we could go to church all day long, every day of the week, and I would seriously question your salvation. And, when Jesus comes again, it will be as THE King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Revelation 19:16 tells us ""On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords."" Now, what does it mean that is King of Kings and Lord of Lords? Well, let's start with defining what it means for Jesus to be our King. What does a King do? A King RULES. He COMMANDS. He is to be OBEYED. In John 14:23 Jesus said ""If anyone loves me, he will KEEP MY WORD, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him."" And in 1 John 3:24 we're told ""Whoever KEEPS HIS COMMANDMENTS abides in him, and he in them..."" In John 3:36 we read: ""Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever DOES NOT OBEY the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him."" So - because Jesus is King - He has the right to command our obedience."
1 Corinthians 3:1-9,"('Forgiveness', 'Envy', 'Strife', 'Division')",Baptist," I. Introduction A. Mr. Lee was terribly overweight, so his doctor put him on a diet. ""I want you to eat regularly for 2 days, then skip a day, and repeat this procedure for 2 weeks. The next time I see you, you'll have lost at least 5 pounds."" When Mr. Lee returned, he shocked the doctor by losing nearly 20 pounds. ""Why, that's amazing!"" the doctor said, ""Did you follow my instructions?"" Mr. Lee nodded. ""I'll tell you though, I thought I was going to drop dead that 3rd day."" ""From hunger, you mean?"" asked the doctor. Replied Mr. Lee, ""No, from skipping."" II. Body A. Lets begin by reading 1 Corinthians 3:1 - 4 1 Corinthians 3:1-4 (NKJV) And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual people but as to carnal, as to babes in Christ. {2} I fed you with milk and not with solid food; for until now you were not able to receive it, and even now you are still not able; {3} for you are still carnal. For where there are envy, strife, and divisions among you, are you not carnal and behaving like mere men? {4} For when one says, ""I am of Paul,"" and another, ""I am of Apollos,"" are you not carnal? 1. The word translated ""carnal"" is a word that means ""flesh"" a. The Greek ending of one word, means ""made of"" b. The Greek ending of another word means ""characterized by"" 2. So that Paul is saying in one place that the Corinthians church is made up of humans, characterized by following the flesh a. Simply put, they were very immature Christians (1) Now Paul says that in the years he spent preaching and teaching in Corinth he did not see spiritual growth beyond the stage of spiritual infancy (2) And consequently, he found that they had not advanced beyond the spiritual infancy they had achieved before (a) Dietrich Bonhoeffer wrote during the German church's controversy over Hitler, ""The unrest in church politics! 'The heart is a stubborn and despondent thing.' Stubbornness and despondency--these can only be overcome in prayer"" (b) Can you imagine Christians having any controversy over Hitler? (c) Even Christians can support the wrong issues 3. Paul points out the several signs, that is evidence, that they are mere babes in Christ a. Note that he does attribute believing faith to these people (1) He calls them babes in Christ b. But he points to these evidences of their infancy (1) Envy (a) Envy of some one else's position i) Position in this world ii) Or position in the church a) Pastor b) Deacon c) Or door keeper, greeter (b) Of another's influence i) Influence in the world ii) Or influence in the church (c) Of another's financial position i) Financial position in the world (2) Strife (a) Envy can cause strife i) A battle to increase one's position often means tearing down another ii) This battle may manifest itself in many ways a) A battle for position of influence b) A battle for doctrinal influence c) A battle for financial influence d) A battle for recognition (3) And divisions (a) The natural consequences of envy and strife is divisions in the church"
Genesis 6:1-22,"('Rejection', 'Probation', 'Plan Of Redemption')",Baptist," ""Life Boat Lessons"" Genesis 6:1-22, 7:1-17 Genesis 6:1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, 2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. 3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years. 4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown. 5 And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. 6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. 7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them. 8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD. 9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God. 10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth. 13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. 14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. 15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. 16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it. 17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die. 18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. 19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. 20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. 21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. 22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he."
Mark 14:38,"('Relapse', 'Backsliding')",Baptist," We've been talking about finding our freedom in Christ. We've outlined steps involved in walking in the victory provided by our Savior. 1) daily admit our need; 2) daily seek God; 3) daily surrender to Christ's control; 4) daily come clean with God; 5) daily cooperate with God's work to change my life; 6) choose to forgive others and make amends when necessary. All believers are to be involved in recovery, learning how to live the new life we have in Christ. But today I want to talk about how you maintain your recovery? How do you not lose the progress you are making in your Christian life? Growth isn't smooth. It's often two steps forward and one step back. It You can have problems and fall back into self-defeating patterns. That's relapse. The Bible term is backsliding (Jeremiah 3:12). The alcoholic goes back to drinking. The overeater gains the weight back. The gambler goes back to the casino. The workaholic fills up his schedule again. We tend to repeat the patterns of our past. It's very easy to slip back. It's easy to slip back into old hurts, old habits and old hang-ups. Let's look at what causes us to relapse or backslide; and how we can avoid it. 1. What causes us to relapse? Relapse follows a predictable pattern. A. Commitment gives way to comfort. You're working the steps we've been talking about and are experiencing freedom through Christ. You're having victory over habits that had overtaken you, hang-ups that had overshadowed you, and hurts that had overwhelmed you. B. Comfort leads to complacency. You start thinking, ""I'm doing pretty good. Life is going pretty smooth. I don't need to go to Bible study. I don't need to go to CR this week. I can miss worship this week. I don't need to read my Bible and pray everyday."" C. Complacency leads to confusion. You think, ""Maybe it wasn't really so bad after all, the problem really wasn't that bad, I can handle it myself."" You start forgetting how bad it was when you weren't walking in freedom and you're tempted to go back to your old ways. D. Confusion leads to compromise. You return to the risky situations that got you in trouble in the first place, the places of temptation. Like the gambler who says, ""Let's go to Vegas, we'll just see the shows."" E. Compromise leads to catastrophe. You go back to living in bondage again; and give into that old habit, hurt, hatred, or hang-up. We find ourselves living like a person who doesn't even know Jesus. 2. How do we prevent a relapse? This brings us to the second ""R"" in ""Recovery."" Reserve a daily time with God for self-examination, Bible reading and prayer in order to know God and His will for my life and gain the power to do it. (READ TEXT) Jesus says it is human nature to have a relapse, to go back to things that mess us up even though we know they mess us up. It's human nature to let past problems revisit us, old hurts, and hang-ups come back to haunt us. So He said, you need to have some safeguards. And that's what this step is about. There are three safeguards that help you maintain your recovery and continue to walk in the freedom we have in Christ."
James 4:1-1:12,"('Resist Devil', 'Submission To God', 'Resist The Devil', 'Holiness And Life', 'Sin And Death')",Presbyterian/Reformed," In our society one of the worst things that can be said of us is, ""They are so divisive"". Our society is all about inclusiveness. We are all about acceptance; all about respecting differences; all about making room for all. That is what makes preaching from James 4:1-12 difficult. It is so divisive. Listen to these words from verse 6: ""You're cheating on God. If all you want is your own way, flirting with the world every chance you get, you end up enemies of God and his way. And do you suppose God doesn't care? The proverb has it that ""he's a fiercely jealous lover."" And what he gives in love is far better than anything else you'll find."" Peterson, Eugene H. The Message: The Bible in Contemporary Language. Colorado Springs, CO: NavPress, 2005. Print. Eugene Peterson may have tried to soften the blow a bit in his Message translation...but, the statement is still divisive, isn't it! Because of statements like these in the Bible, Christians are often accused of being divisive. But, what is actually causing the divisions? Christians? Non-Christians? Is God causing this? Or is it the problem of sin? A Definition of Sin First John 3:4 ""Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness."" This is the best definition of sin that there is in the Bible. When you see the word ""is"" think about working with mathematics. The word ""is"" is really an equal sign so you could say that ""sin = lawlessness."" That is, sin is the breaking of God's Law...so everyone who sins is breaking the Law of God and in rebellion to God's will. And, as we will see shortly, that leaves us all guilty for we are all sinners. Have you ever noticed you don't have to teach your kids to be rebellious against you and your authority? Starts around 2 years old...they learn the word NO They want to establish their independence ... that they are separate from Mom and Dad. Continues into Childhood Then, puberty...where the rebellion escalates to include all authority...whether parental or societal. In fact rebellion remains with us for a life-time. So, from the two year old shouting NO to President Trump saying he has no need of forgiveness because he has never done anything wrong... to the dying words of 1950's actress Joan Crawford who, when a nurse attempted to pray over her as she was dying, said, ""don't you dare ask God to help me."" we are living in a world that is in rebellion! But why? Why is this true? Why is our world surrounded by chaos...and, rebellion...and, hatred...and war? This is a good question because St. Paul makes a statement about sin and how it came to be a problem for humans: Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned (18)Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men. 19 For as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's obedience the many will be made righteous. 20 The Holy Bible: English Standard Version.

Mark 6:1-6,"('Follow Jesus', 'Familiarity', 'Perceptions', 'Physical Realm', 'Spiritual Realm')",Evangelical Free," Let's continue to worship with the Gospel of Mark. The Gospel of Mark does not talk about Jesus' birth or upbringing; we can read about that part of Jesus' life in the other Gospels. In the very beginning of the Gospel of Mark, right after His water baptism as an adult, Jesus began His ministry by performing many miracles, teaching about the Kingdom of God, and calling people back to God through Him. After years of being away, Jesus returns home. Open your Bibles to Mark 6 and let's learn from Jesus and His old neighbors...... Read along with me Mark 6:1-6.... Let us summarize what happened. v1: Jesus went to His hometown with His disciples. v2a: It was a worship day and so Jesus taught God's Word at church! v2b: People were amazed at Jesus' wisdom and the power He had to do miracles! But then, v3: The people took offense at Jesus (they went against Him). Why?? There can be many reasons, but the main reason why they took offense is because they only looked at Jesus' physicality but not at His spirituality! Can this happen to us as people look at us?? We must grasped and understand this, so that we will not get frustrated. How was your week in this area?? And, it can also happen the other way around; we can judge people and not see their spiritual blindness. I am guilty of this! We'll touch base more about his in our application. v4.... Why did Jesus say that?? a. He is a prophet from God! b. God's prophets are to be honored! c. Because of familiarity, prophets will be questioned! d. a note to the disciples (expect this problem to happen)! v5-6a?? Miracles comes with faith! v6b: People's lack of faith did not stop Jesus from ministering! What biblical principles can we apply from this passage? 1. Teaching God's Word is part of worship at church! 2. We must try and see people's spirituality before making a judgment. Pray! Pray! Pray! On the other hand. 3. As Christians we must not be surprised that we are misunderstood by non-believers! What should we do, when people are not listening to what we are saying about God?? 4. More faith = more miracles from God! How do we build our faith?? 5. Follow Jesus' example to continue teaching the Word even if people have a lack of faith! Proclaim the truth from God no matter what happens! You and I are called by our Lord Jesus Christ! Who else will proclaim the truth about God to those in our sphere of influence?"
2 Kings 6:24-7:20,"('Suffering', 'Famine', ""God's Sovereignty"", 'Enduring Suffering', ""God's Time"")",Independent/Bible," Serving God During Dark Times (2 Kings 6:24-7:20) 1. Today I am resuming the tradition of ethnic jokes I began a while ago. Many ethnicities make fun of their neighboring nations as not being too bright. 2. Two Belgians are driving a truck and arrive at a bridge with a warning sign: maximum height 4 meters. They get off and measure their truck. It's 6 meters high. - What shall we do? asks the one. - I don't see any police, says the other one, so let's drive on 3. How about a Swedish joke? Ole (Norwegian) and Sven (Swedish) went on a fishing trip to Canada and come back with only three fish. Ole says, - The way I figger it, Sven, each of them fish cost us $400 ! - Well, at dat price it's a good ting we didn't catch any more of em than we did, says Sven. [source: europeisnotdead.com] 4. The Syrians, aka, Aramaeans, looked down on the Israelites. As a matter of fact, whenever you abuse someone or some group, instead of feeling bad, you usually think they deserved it because they are inferior. This is a documented human attitude. We tend to make ourselves look justified. Today's text stands in contrast to last week's. In the previous passage, God intervened in a timely fashion; many times He doesn't intervene at all. In today's texts, we see an example of God intervening in a delayed fashion, in time for most but not for all. Main Idea: Elisha was in rough situations, but was still God's man in the midst of it all. We, too, represent God during different but challenging times. I. God Can Place Us in DIFFICULT Situations and Eras for a Reason (6:24-7:20). A. Severe famine because of a SEIGE by the Syrians (6:24-25). B. The King of Israel FAULTS Elisha (6:26-33). C. Elisha makes prophetic PREDICTIONS (7:1-2). D. God uses four LEPERS as scouts to deliver the people of Samaria (7:3-15). E. Elisha's prophecies are FULFILLED (7:16-20). We, too, represent God during different but challenging times. II. How This Event CONTRASTS and Compares with the Previous Event (6:8-23) A. The Syrians were fed at the expense of Israel, now Israel is fed at the expense of the SYRIANS. B. The King of Syria was out to get Elisha, here the King of ISRAEL is out to get him. C. In both instances, the Syrians are ROUTED without a fight. D. In the first account, Elisha and his servant SEE the horses and chariots of fire; here, the Syrians probably HEAR God's army. III. What Are Some LESSONS We Can Learn from this Account? A. God has always allowed His children to go through really BAD times. 1. There are times where we struggle with depression. 2. There are times when we want to retreat from life & cower in a corner. 3. Illness, rejection, relational/financial/emotional stresses, tragedies, losses... 4. Sometimes it gets worse. Man sold only one dress. Next day none. 3rd worse. B. God intervenes in His TIME, not ours! "" Sometimes blessing are on the way, right at hand -- even in bleakest times. "" We have a saying, ""It is always darkest before the dawn."" "" Often true, but often is not the same as always."
John 14:1-4,"(""God's Promises"", 'Do Not Fear', 'Comfort In Christ', 'Do Not Worry')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," The Comforting Christ Introduction: It is amazing how Christ will rush down from his throne to wrap his loving arms around us during our darkest times. God's love for us is truly amazing. We sometimes believe that if we do more for God, he will love us more. If we witness more, or if we give more, or if we go to church more, then he will love us more. We think this way because we are prone to love others based on conditions. It often seems that we love those who love us, we love those who are kind to us, we love those who agree with us, view things as we do, etc. And how often have we worked for the love of others. That is conditional love. The Love of God is unconditional. There simply is nothing you can do to make God love you more and there is nothing you can do to make him love you less. 1 John 4:8 says ""Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love."" This is good medicine for our souls, because sometimes we think that God has forgotten us. We think that he cares about everyone else's pain, everyone else's situation, but for some reason you believe that he has forgotten about you. You may think that being perfect will make God love you. It may surprise you to know that the apostles were not perfect men either. At one point, Paul approved of the murder of Christians, Peter denied knowing Jesus, Thomas doubted Jesus' resurrection. And the old testament servants didn't fare any better. Moses murdered a fellow Hebrew, King David lusted after his friends wife and committed adultery with her and then essentially had him murdered to have his wife for himself, Noah was found drunk and passed out on the floor naked by his sons. If you were to accuse any of these men of God for these specific things, you would not be wrong. It should give us some comfort to know that even the most devoted disciples, were no more worthy of God's love than you or me. God is Love. Transition: This morning we will be preaching on three comforts that Jesus gave his disciples when they were discouraged. [John 14:1-4] I. Jesus comforts them with a Command ""Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God. Trust also in me."" -Jn 14:1 Just prior to Jesus saying these words he dropped three big bombshells on his disciples. He says that he will be going away and they could not come. He told them one of them was a traitor. He told Disciple Peter he would deny him three times. That is a lot to take in and you can imagine how the disciples were disheartened. But what is amazing is that even as Jesus was haunted by the foreknowledge of the coming ridicule, the humiliation of the crown of thorns, the thoughts of the foreboding 39 lashes from the cat of nine tails (an instrument meant to slash and grab the flesh and pull it away) and as the dreaded cross loomed before him like the darkest shadow - knowing that he would have to carry it, in total exhaustion up a shameful hill called ""the skull."" His only reprieve from its weight would be when it was finally placed into the rocky ground where he would then be nailed to it. And yet as he alluded to this dismal appointment with his disciples, he puts all of his own dread for it behind him so that he can comfort his disciples with this command: ""Do not let YOUR hearts be troubled. ..."""

(Malachi 3:8-10 NASB) Introduction: Jesus talked much about money. Sixteen of the thirty-eight parables were concerned with how to handle money and possessions. In the Gospels, an amazing one out of ten verses (288 in all) deal directly with the subject of money. The Bible offers 500 verses on prayer, less than 500 verses on faith, but more than 2,000 verses on money and possessions. Howard L. Dayton, Jr., Leadership, Vol. 2, no. 2. I. Giving is an act of obedience a. Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so do you also. On the first day of every week each one of you is to put aside and save, as he may prosper, so that no collections be made when I come. (1 Corinthians 16:1-2 NASB) b. ""If I were hungry I would not tell you, For the world is Mine, and all it contains. (Psalms 50:12 NASB) II. Giving is an act of trust a. And He sat down opposite the treasury, and began observing how the people were putting money into the treasury; and many rich people were putting in large sums. A poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which amount to a cent. Calling His disciples to Him, He said to them, ""Truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all the contributors to the treasury; for they all put in out of their surplus, but she, out of her poverty, put in all she owned, all she had to live on."" (Mark 12:41-44 NASB) b. and they began selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with all, as anyone might have need. (Acts 2:45 NASB) III. Giving is an act of service a. So I thought it necessary to urge the brethren that they would go on ahead to you and arrange beforehand your previously promised bountiful gift, so that the same would be ready as a bountiful gift and not affected by covetousness. (2 Corinthians 9:5 NASB) b. For the Scripture says, ""YOU SHALL NOT MUZZLE THE OX WHILE HE IS THRESHING,"" and ""The laborer is worthy of his wages."" (1 Timothy 5:18 NASB) IV.

Summary: This sermon deals the need to live out the Christian life with effectiveness. Tanzania's most inspirational athlete 2016-05-11 In 1968, four athletes were sent on the long journey from East Africa to Mexico City in pursuit of Tanzania's first-ever Olympic medal. While none returned with gold, silver or bronze, the name of one man - John Stephen Akhwari - endures to this day as a source of inspiration to countless athletes and fans in his country and around the world. Akhwari was on the back foot from an early stage and began suffering from cramp as a result of the high altitude. Determined to improve his position, he was then involved in a pile-up with other athletes nearing the halfway point of the race, causing him to suffer a badly gashed and dislocated right knee, as well as a bruised shoulder. After receiving some treatment and a bandage for his knee from trackside medics, the Tanzanian elected to continue, and finish what he had started. ""A voice calls from within to go on -- and so he goes on,"" said an Olympic commentator. When asked why he persevered in such punishing circumstances, Akhwari uttered one of the most memorable and inspirational lines in the history of the Games: ""My country did not send me 5,000 miles to start the race,"" he said. ""They sent me 5,000 miles to finish the race."" In the reading this morning of Jeremiah chapter 2 we find that Israel starts well in the reading but looking forward as the nation runs God'srace it fails terribly indeed the last words of chapter 2 say - 32 Does a young woman forget her jewelry, a bride her wedding ornaments? Yet my people have forgotten me, days without number. 33 How skilled you are at pursuing love! Even the worst of women can learn from your ways. 34 On your clothes is found the lifeblood of the innocent poor, though you did not catch them breaking in. Yet in spite of all this 35 you say, 'I am innocent; he is not angry with me.' But I will pass judgment on you If we get nothing else from this passage of Jeremiah it is the thought that we must cross the finish line well. Powering on for God as we cross the line. 1st keep the finishing line in sight. Jesus does this - So does Elijah who could possibly forget the moment in 1 Kings when the great Prophet leaves on the chariots of Israel with his successor hanging onto his shirttail for a double blessing?"
Joshua 24:15,"('Commitment', 'Finances')",Foursquare," A Godly Commitment Needed Joshua 24:15 In 1519 Spanish explorer Cortez landed at Vera Cruz to begin his conquest of Mexico with only 700 men. Legend has it that before they set off into Mexico's interior Cortez ordered the ships to be burned while his men watched their only means of retreat sink to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico. Now there was only one direction they could take. Commitments are quickly becoming outdated, as people are reluctant to make commitments without having loopholes built into them. Take marriages for example. One comic strip had one man speaking to another saying, ""You know, it's odd, but now that I'm actually engaged I'm starting to feel nervous about getting married!"" The other man replied, ""I know what you mean. It's only natural to be nervous! Marriage is a big commitment. Seven or eight years can be a long time!"" Today marriages are no longer long-term commitments. No longer are they until death do us part. Rather it's until people no longer feel like it, and that's because marriages today are built around feelings, not commitments. Instead of working it out it's ""Let's call it quits and go our separate ways. And we can still be friends."" Yeah right, and what planet are they from. We live in a world where long-term commitments are no longer wanted or desired. This is true in marriage, work, and even the church. Today we fear commitments and live by the creed, ""I want to keep my options open."" In other words, we don't want to get to the end of the buffet line and find out we have no more room on our plates for the cake and ice cream. People today just don't want to make commitments, and because of it they're missing out on building a great life for themselves and for their family. When we make a commitment we're choosing how we're going to invest our lives, time, and resources. And when we refuse to make life's most important commitments, that that is faith in Jesus Christ, we're missing out on a life that will count for all eternity. The sad reality is that a lot of those who go to church today won't be seen in the next two to five years in the church. Some will leave the community, be a part of another church, but the majority won't be found in any church. One of the main reasons is that they didn't or wouldn't fully commit to God. They refuse to burn the ships in the harbor, and so when things get rough they retreat to the comfort of the ships and the old land they left behind. Today's churches are filled with casual Christians, and while they say they're following the Lord, in reality they're following the world, or worshiping in ways not prescribed by God. If we're ever going to see a spiritual revival, then a commitment needs to be made by Christians much like the commitment made by Joshua. ""And if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord, choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."" (Joshua 24:15 NKJV)"
1 Corinthians 6:9-11,"('Deception', 'Hope', 'Relativism', ""God's Word"")",Foursquare," The Kingdom of God ""Humanity's Only Hope"" 1 Corinthians 6:9-11 There is no more ridiculous charge brought against the Bible than it is an old book and no longer relevant. Yet there is nothing more remarkable than the reality that the Bible has always been contemporary, up to date, and relevant, having something to say to each and every generation. There isn't a single topic of our day that the Bible doesn't address. ""Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God."" (1 Corinthians 6:9-11 NKJV) The Bible has always had a word and it always has had the last word, and that's because it's God's word. It's not a human book of theories and ideas; rather it's a book that while written by men, they were moved by the Holy Spirit to write these words. ""Knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit."" (2 Peter 1:20-21 NKJV) These men were not writing their own opinions; rather they were writing what God told them to write, they were writing under the direction of the Holy Spirit. ""All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work."" (2 Timothy 3:16-17 NKJV) The word, ""inspiration"" in the Greek language means that the Scriptures were literally breathed into by God. It comes from the Greek words for God and breath. And so it was that the Breath of God, the Holy Spirit, breathed out these words into these men who wrote them and thus breathing them into us. Therefore, the business of the church is to preach the Bible, to unfold and expound upon the message of God's word. ""How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?"" (Romans 10:14 NKJV) In our passage Paul says, ""Do you not know."" He expected the Corinthian church to know these things, so the Bible gives us knowledge that is absolutely vital to our life. To put this another way, all the trouble we're experiencing is due to our ignorance of certain fundamental truths, the most foundational of them all is that Jesus came into this world so that we no longer have to walk in the darkness of ignorance. When Pontius Pilate questioned Jesus about His kingdom and whether He was indeed a king, Jesus said, ""You say rightly that I am a king. For this cause I was born, and for this cause I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice."" (John 18:37 NKJV)"
"Matthew 18:21-35, Luke 7:36-50","('Forgiving Others', 'Love  Of God')",Christian/Church Of Christ," CANCELED DEBT (part two) Recap: What are improper responses to our canceled debt? We start accumulating more debt. People claim bankruptcy and then go right back to accumulating more debt. Why? Because they either don't care or they didn't learn the lesson that their poor choices got them into this mess. It can be the same way spiritually. Do we care about what Jesus did to cancel our debt? Do we see the need to live a different way? An improper response to having our spiritual debt canceled is to go right back to living how we always did. Are we appreciative? When Jesus healed the ten lepers only one came back to thank him. And Jesus rewarded him for it. We need to show appreciation for our canceled debt. Appreciation is not going back into a life of sin. Appreciation is serving the cause of Christ. It's about understanding grace. An improper response to God's grace is to go back into a life of sin. An improper response to grace is to be unwilling to serve Jesus or serve him begrudgingly. When I appreciate I respond to God's grace by saying no to ungodliness and living a godly life, being eager to do good. However, an improper response to canceled debt is when nothing changes. And if nothing changes things will get worse. When we've been forgiven we have an obligation-to replace the old with the new. It's not enough to stop sinning we must now replace the old thoughts and behaviors with spiritual ones. If we stop but don't replace it will just be a matter of time before we go back to our old ways. When we come out of that old life and start living the new life but are then enticed and drawn back to the old life, becoming entangled again to the point where we abandon the new life it's worse because we had the choice between godliness and sin and chose sin. Improper responses. What do we do as a proper response to our canceled debt? Cancel someone else's debt. Matt. 18:21-35, ""Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, ""Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"" Jesus answered, ""I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times. ""Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him. Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt. ""The servant fell on his knees before him. 'Be patient with me,' he begged, 'and I will pay back everything.' The servant's master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go. ""But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. He grabbed him and began to choke him. 'Pay back what you owe me!' he demanded. ""His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.' ""But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt. When the other servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed and went and told their master everything that had happened. ""Then the master called the servant in. 'You wicked servant,' he said, 'I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to. Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?' In anger his master turned him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed. ""This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart."""
2 Samuel 18:1-19:8,"(""God's Will"", 'Desires')",Independent/Bible," Man has his desires, God has His will. Our desires do not always sync with His, of course. "" We can have godly desires, knowing what God wants. We can have ungodly and selfish ones, driven by what we want. "" There is nothing wrong with human desires; God made us with such longings. "" But our desires need to be ""sanctified"" so to speak, so that we know God's will and wants what God wants, because that's good. That's why God made us. We are going to see today a very torn David. "" He knows he need to defend his Kingdom. But on the other side, his enemy is his son. "" On one side, we have man's desires - our wishes, our wants, and our longings. We want things our way. "" Yet on the other side, we know we have God's will. And very often, God's plan and His ways are very different from ours. We see this confusion over the next two chapters. Man's desires versus God's will. Read 2 Sam 18:1-5. "" Absalom is determined to kill him. David organises his army into 3 divisions. His men suggest that he remains in the city (Mahanaim). "" And then he gave a very odd and difficult command - ""Be gentle with the young man Absalom for my sake."" And all the troops heard the king giving orders concerning Absalom to each of the commanders. (18:5) DILEMMA 1: TO FIGHT OR NOT TO FIGHT (Be Gentle with him) In those days, to kill the King signal the end of the war. The battle is won. But now they are told to be gentle with Absalom. "" So are they going to fight him and spare him? Can this conflict be resolved without Absalom removed, who is so bent on killing David? "" What are the consequences? How can his men go to war with such an injunction? We have no answer to these. When man's desire clashes with God's will, there won't be clarity. Man sees only what they want. "" The dilemma stems from man's desire. David was so carried away by what he wants, that he did not consider the consequences. "" It apparent that the author wants to highlight to us these confusing situations when man's desires get in the way of God's plan. He leads us into another very torn situation - 2 Sam 18:9-15. (Explain as we read) "" The battle was highly successful. David's men had a great victory; Absalom and his army was badly defeated. DILEMMA 2: TO KILL OR NOT TO KILL Joab decided to do what was sensible and necessary in battle - kill your enemy. "" He did it quickly and sounded the trumpet. That signalled the end of the war. And then comes the 3rd confusing situation - what message are you going to send back to the King - we won the war, or his son is dead. Read 2 Sam 18:19-33. DILEMMA 3: TO TELL OR NOT TO TELL. It's a long one. The author devotes so much space to these rather insignificant details to highlight the dilemma - how would the King react? "" You have WHO to go, WHAT to say, HOW they are going to say it, and WHO will reach the KING first - the one bearing good news, or the not-so-good news? "" What is consider GOOD NEWS? We won the war! Or, the enemy is dead! When man's desires takes precedent, we don't really know. When everyone does what they like, there will likely be chaos and confusion."
Acts 1:9-11,"(""Jesus' Return"", '2 Men', 'Come In Like Manner')",Baptist, Corinthians 1.9-," May 13, 2013 By: Tom Lowe Series: The Early Church Title: The Ascension and Predicted Return Acts 1.9-11 (KJV) 9 And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. 10 And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; 11 Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven. Commentary And when he had spoken these things, ""When he had spoken these things,"" and had said all that he had to say, and having left instructions with them with regard to the proclamation of the Gospel in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and then to the entire world; and after He had promised them the full power of the Holy Spirit, with whom he would govern his church (even though he would be absent in body), he blessed them, according to Luke 24:50--""And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them""--and then He left them. while they beheld, It is specifically stated that ""while they were looking He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight."" Luke describes the episode just as it was told to him: ""And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven. And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen"" (Luke 24:50-53; KJV). It is critical that he added ""while they beheld"" when he retold the story in this letter written to Theophilus. If this detail were omitted, it could be concluded that He disappeared while His disciples were looking in another direction. But now we know they saw Him ascend and disappear with their own eyes. Elijah, who rode to heaven, in a fiery chariot, told his followers, ""...If thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so"" (2 Kings 2:10; KJV). SEEING IS BELIEVING! he was taken up; He was gradually taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight. We have here the report of Christ's ascending on high, not extracted or withdrawn, as Elijah was, with a chariot of fire and horses of fire, but Christ ascended to heaven, just as he rose from the grave, purely by his own power; his body is now, as the bodies of the saints will be at the resurrection, a spiritual body, and raised in power and incorruption. He began his ascension while the disciples watched, and kept Him in sight until He disappeared into the clouds. They could not be deceived, because they kept their eyes on Him; it is likely that he did not fly swiftly up, but moved slowly upwards. There are seven observations that should be made about this most remarkable event."
Luke 7:18-35,"('Crisis', 'Kingdom Of God', 'Power And Dominion')",Lutheran," Luke 7:18-35 ""Signs of the Kingdom"" INTRODUCTION Every one of us experience watershed events in our lives. These are times when our way of thinking, our perspective on life and the path that we follow is dramatically altered. For many Christians one of these events was when they began to live in their baptismal covenant, or as some would say, ""Received Jesus as their Lord and Savior."" Some have near death experiences that drastically change their lives. A watershed event for others may be when God doesn't do what they want God to do and they give up on their faith. In the passage of Scripture before us today, we see John the Baptist at a watershed point in his life. When we read this story of John and Jesus, we are able to learn a great deal about living in a relationship with God and what the kingdom of God is like. CRISIS If anyone should have known that Jesus was the Messiah, it should have been John. Luke has John recognizing Jesus and jumping in his mother's womb, when they first met (Luke 1:44). John baptized Jesus and witnessed the Holy Spirit descend upon him. Still, John sends his disciples to ask Jesus, ""Are you the one who is to come, or are we to wait for another?"" John has been imprisoned by King Herod. Sitting in a cold, dank cell he begins to wonder. Also, Jesus wasn't quite the Messiah that John thought he would be. John had preached a Messiah that would bring God's judgment, would overthrow governments and establish God's kingdom. Jesus was anything but that. John started to think that he had been mistaken. The fact that he was looking for God to act in a specific way blinded him to what God was actually doing. There have been times when people have seen suffering in the world and have wondered why God hasn't interceded and ended the suffering. What they perceive as God's lack of action has caused them to turn away from the faith. For some of us, God hasn't done what we have wanted God to do. It might have been healing from a sickness, getting a promotion, or any number of things. The fact that God didn't act in the way we wanted God to act has had us question our faith. Certainly we have experienced this at Desert Streams. We were very sure that God was moving to enable us to build a worship and community center. When that didn't happen, we have questioned what God is doing and perhaps wondered if God is doing anything in our world. Our waiting for our land to sell as increased our questioning. Our downward trend in attendance, I think, is in part due to this struggle. LOOKING FOR POWER John was looking for a powerful Messiah. John wanted the kingdom of God to move in powerful ways. The people who came out to hear John wanted to see power. They were people who usually looked to people in soft robes--people who were in authority and exercised power--to be their problem solvers. We have been seduced by power. We have bought the argument that power will bring peace, even though increasing uses of power have not brought greater peace. Often parents have relied on power and tough love to control their children. Often then discover that they have little control and tough love is not the path toward building a stronger relationship."
Luke 7:36-50,"('Forgiveness', 'Perspective', 'Judgemental')",Lutheran," Introduction A high-school sophomore asks to talk with her parents after dinner. Sitting around the kitchen table, the young girl takes a deep breath and informs her parents that she is pregnant. The parents' reaction is as expected. The dad threatens to kill her boyfriend after stringing him up by certain parts of his anatomy. The mother begins a lecture on the responsibilities of parenthood and how difficult it will be to attend school while caring for a child. In the middle of their raving, the girl raises her hands for silence. ""I'm not really pregnant,"" she says. ""I just wanted you to be able to put it in perspective when I told you that I got a C- in English."" We have talked frequently about how ""repenting"" or getting a new perspective on life is important for our walks of faith. We see that again in this story of forgiveness and salvation. Our perspective either limits or enhances our experience of salvation. Simon This story has two main characters--Simon, who is a Pharisee and the woman, who is a sinner. Simon was a good man. As a Pharisee he, like Jesus, was concerned with how a person lived out his life in relationship with God. If Simon lived today, he would be active in his church or synagogue and perhaps he would even be serving on the congregational council. The author of Luke uses a little used literary device called ""Internal Monologue."" It was rarely used in ancient literature. When it was is indicated at time of crisis. The crisis that Simon faces is determining if Jesus is a prophet and if his judgment of the woman is correct. ""Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, ""If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him--that she is a sinner."" (Luke 7:39) Simon did not want to talk about what was going through his mind. Jesus, though, forced him into a dialogue. The parable Jesus tells corrects Simon and invites him to live in salvation. ""When they could not pay, he canceled the debts for both of them. Now which of them will love him more?"" Simon answered, ""I suppose the one for whom he canceled the greater debt."" And Jesus said to him, 'You have judged rightly'"" (Luke 7:42-43). The Woman The woman is identified as a sinner. This, however, was not of her own choosing. It was the result of a patriarchal, unjust society. The woman is like the 2.4 million people--mostly children--who are involved in sex trafficking today. The laws of the day prevented women from owning property or working outside of the home. The only way a widow or single woman could survive was through begging or prostitution. Sometime previously the woman had encountered Jesus. She may have listened to his teaching. The woman might have even witnessed Jesus heal the sick or cast out demons. In her encounter with Jesus the woman sense his love for her and others like her. The woman takes a risk. She enters a place where women were not to be and acted scandalously. She touched a man in public. She doesn't stop there, though. The woman bathes Jesus' feet with her tears, wipes them with her hair and anoints his feet with ointment."
Ephesians 5:1-7,"('Happiness', 'Self-Esteem')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Secure Your Self-Esteem The Habits of Happiness Part 4 Ephesians 5:1-7 We all want to be happy. I bet there is no single person who intentionally chooses to be unhappy. However, so many people in this word are not happy for one reason or another. In order to be happy, this is what we have to realize. Happiness is our choice. Happiness is something that we choose. In order to be happy, we must do things that will bring happiness. Therefore, during this series, we are talking about habits that we must build to experience happiness in our lives. And today we will talk about the importance of building our self-esteem. Most of us have fallen for the temptation to use external symbols of significance to prove we matter. For some, it is designer clothes. For others, it is expensive jewelry. For still others, it is fancy shoes or fast cars. We see magazines that show models who are well dressed and look confident. There are ads describing which watch, which tie, which shoes, which car will make us feel like that person. And the advertisers say, ""Just buy these symbols of success, and you can also feel important."" They say, ""Buy these symbols of significance, and you will finally solve your self-esteem issue."" It is a plausible theory. However, problem is this: It does not work! All the symbols of significance offer some boost. However, they do not last. They are not permanent. In fact, they usually put us on the treadmill of having to keep acquiring all the newest and latest symbol of significance. This is why some people always have to upgrade to the newest stuff. However, this turns into very expensive, time consuming, unsatisfying road to nowhere. Today I want to talk about real substance, not symbols. I want to talk about permanent cures, not short-term fixes. I want to talk directly about how we can secure our self-esteem. As with most real cures, the process of securing healthy self-esteem is not magical, instantaneous, or effortless. But it is effective. This one is guaranteed by God Himself. The Apostle Paul tells us to follow these things if we want to secure healthy self-esteem. I. We must believe the right thing (vv. 1-2). Almost all of us grew up believing in Santa Claus. However, at a certain age, we realized that they were not real. Therefore, we adjusted our beliefs regarding Santa Claus. Similarly, our self-esteem is largely based on how we were treated in the past. During those early formative years, if we were loved, trusted, and accepted, we conclude that we are loveable, trustworthy, acceptable, and valuable. And we developed a healthy self-esteem. However, if we experienced disinterest, anger, rejection, embarrassment, and conditional love, we concluded that we are unlovable, unacceptable, unimportant, unable or incompetent. And some of us continue believing in those early beliefs even though they are not true. We kept on believing them. The most important step in building our self-esteem is to subject our belief about our value to the evidence revealed in the Bible. Then we must make a decision based on the evidence in the Bible."
Acts 6:1-7,"('Growth', 'Teamwork', 'Empowering Others')",Christian/Church Of Christ," The 3 C's of a Healthy Church - Find the Right People to Serve Acts 6:1-7 (p. 762) February 26, 2017 Introduction: Jon Weece in the book ""Jesus Prom"" says: ""When we stop moving, we start dying. Too many churches are filled with too many people who are fans of Jesus but not followers of Jesus. The body of Christ doesn't need more spectators. The body of Christ needs more servants...it needs more people who will go...because ""Servants can go places Kings can't."" I met Gil the other night...and the first thing I noticed was Gil looks exactly like Danny Glover...in fact I said, ""Man, you look exactly like Danny Glover."" He smiled and said, ""I get that all the time...I'm not an actor, but I wish I had some of his money."" I was at our Room in the Inn ministry where we house and feed men who need some help...and Karl VanDyke, one of our Elders gave me the privilege to pray with these guys and our volunteers before the meal. And as I looked around at these men and the servants who had set up the beds, gone to get them, and prepare the meal I felt a great surge of emotion and just wanted to tell these folks: ""We love you...we are so glad you are here and safe for tonight...and it's a privilege to be here with you."" Kevin and Steve would stay and help these guys all night and in the morning, and then take them to a drop off place. After I prayed...Gil came up to me and said, ""Thank you...he was emotional and said, ""Pray for our nation's leaders, pray for our country...pray that we will be one."" And we hugged each other...not the quick get it out of the way hug guys do a lot of the time, but a real hug, with all the emotions that go with it. So when I read those words ""Servants can go places Kings can't,"" Gil's face came to mind, because when you serve you get to be where Jesus wants you to be...and you get to fall in love with the people Jesus fell in love with. The Church was never meant to be confined to a building. The church was designed by Jesus to be a mobile, agile, flexible, and tangible movement of the Spirit of God. Wherever Christians go, that's where the Church is. We don't go to Church...we are the Church. We assemble together to prepare and worship but our focus should always be toward Jesus and others...Upward and outward. So who are the right people to serve? How do we identify, prepare them, and release them? I think we have a great example in Acts Chapter 6: I. IDENTIFY AND RELEASE SPIRIT FILLED AND GUIDED SERVANTS The Apostles were the leaders and preachers in the early church. ""Day after day in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah."" (Acts 5:42) It doesn't mean they were the only ones sharing the Good News...because those they had discipled were also influencing their friends and family daily with what had happened in their lives because of this message and the Holy Spirit."
"Luke 11:34-36, Matthew 6:22-24","('Discernment', 'Open Eyes', 'Light Of The World', 'Light And Darkness')",Presbyterian/Reformed," See To It, Then Luke 11:34-36 and Matthew 6:22-24 34 Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are healthy, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are unhealthy, your body also is full of darkness. 35 See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness. 36 Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be just as full of light as when a lamp shines its light on you."" Today we listen to another parable of Jesus that instructs us not to listen but to look. In this chapter of the Gospel of Luke Jesus teaches us ""The Lord's Prayer and defines for us the importance of obedience through faith versus obedience through legalism. Wanting to obey God's word versus having to obey God's word. There were prominent religious leaders present with the crowds while Jesus went through these parables. His words were meant as much for their hearing as it was for the common folk. Religion had become a construct of man with a long list of laws and offences and for too long faith, the gift of God had been neglected. It is this living faith that Jesus wants us to see with our eyes and take into our bodies. This verse along with Matthew 6:22-24 are often diluted to a phrase Jesus never used; ""the eyes are the window to the soul"". That's not exactly what Jesus is saying here so let's go back and re-read Jesus words so that they are not lost in translation. Jesus said ""Your eye is the lamp of your body."" I take that to mean that our eyes serve a vital function for our bodies. ""When your eyes are healthy, your whole body also is full of light."" Healthy eyes allow light to be dispersed throughout our entire body. Every cell if you will. Sunlight provides our body with vitamin D3 and the ultraviolet light helps lower our blood pressure. But Jesus is talking of another kind of light here. The light of God. It provides even greater benefits. ""But when they are unhealthy, your body also is full of darkness."" Unhealthy eyes fail to let the light in and the result is a body that is full of darkness. Again every cell is affected. ""See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness."" It is our responsibility to be sure our eyes are healthy instead of unhealthy. We alone have the power to open or close them to the light. We have a choice. We cannot blame God's word or the preacher or our parents for failing to open our eyes to the light. The power to do so rests with us. Letting the light in will be of benefit to the whole body, every part, heart, mind, and soul. Failing to let in the light will result in darkness affecting every part. Jesus warns us to ""see to it, then"" that the light within us is not darkness. That's an interesting phrase Jesus is using here. Can darkness be understood as a kind of light? Yes. Have you ever heard of black light? If you grew up in the 60's or 70's you may recall buying a black light that would illuminate a poster or an album cover. There actually is such a thing as black light. It is just one part of the spectrum of light. It's actually ultraviolet light not black but it is so dark that it is called black."
"Luke 10:25-37, Romans 5:6-8","('Luke', 'Neighbor', 'Good Samaitan')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Title: Who Is My Neighbor? Text: Luke 10 Date: 1/1/17 Intro Well good morning Real Life, welcome to the new year! It's crazy to think 2016 has already come and gone... Last year at this time my wife and I were getting ready to make the 33 hour drive out here. A few months before that we had sold our house, put all our stuff in storage, and decided to travel the country until God showed us what was next. A path that would eventually lead here. We traveled all over for about 4 months, during the last months of 2015 and first week of 2016 my wife and I saw over 30 states. But a funny thing happened at the end of that trek. I started wanting routine. Don't get me wrong, I loved traveling. But our life was so up in the air and filled with so much uncertainty that I was ready for routine and stability. Once we got here I was ready to settle down, get back to work, have projects around the house, and just have a semi normal routine. We are creatures of habit aren't we? We like our routines... We like to be in a familiar place, with familiar people, at a familiar time. Take this church for example... If you have been coming here for awhile chances are you sit in the same seat... And if your seat is taken when you show up you might even get a little upset. We are creatures of habit. We like to see things through the same lens the same perspective, the same place. This week I want to shake that up that tendency we have. Tension To do this we are going to look at one of the most famous stories Jesus ever told. So famous that we have named hospitals after the main character in this story. It's the story of the Good Samaritan... If you have your Bibles or want to pull out your phones, flip over to Luke 10:25... On one occasion a lawyer stood up to test Jesus. ""Teacher,"" he asked, ""what must I do to inherit eternal life?"" Luke 10:25 Let's stop there for a minute. First Luke tells us that this guy came up to test Jesus. This guy knows the law inside and out. So the first question is why would this guy be interested in what Jesus has to say? His first question gives us a clue this guy is looking for. This question he asks should set some bells and whistles off in our minds. ""What must I do to inherit eternal life? The answer is nothing, we can't do anything to get God's love, we can't do anything to deserve salvation. There's no way we can be good enough. Though that doesn't stop us from trying. That doesn't stop us from thinking that if we just do enough good stuff it will out weigh the bad stuff. Now before we start criticizing this guy... Don't you and I do this all the time? I am the king of lawyering and finding the loop hole. When I was about 8-9 my mom starting leaving me alone while she ran to the store. She had two rules for me when I was home alone... Under NO circumstances could I go to the door. And if someone called I could not tell them I was alone. I knew exactly what the rules were. But I also knew exactly where the loopholes were... One day while alone I noticed my friend walking up to my house. I knew the rules I wasn't allowed to go to the door. But my mom never said anything about going to the window... That blew up in my face when he went home and his mom asked if I was home and he responded ""His mom's not home, he can't come to the door."" She asked how do you know that? ""he answered the window."""
Romans 14:1-18,"('Grace', 'Gospel Of John', 'Disputable Matters', 'Grace And Truth')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," GUIDANCE Genesis 24:1-27 INTRODUCTION Christian people are often keen to know the leading of God in their lives. But how are we to know what God's will is? We may find the answer to this important question when we look at Abraham's servant in Genesis 24. First, though, what do we know about God's will? What has He revealed to us in the Scriptures? God has given certain commandments for us to obey. Whatever plan God has for our lives, it will be in keeping with those things which he has already clearly revealed to us. What is more, as we obey His commands, and walk with Him in love, He will gradually unfold to us what He wants us to do in the course of any day, and throughout our lives. We, like Abraham's servant, must live one day at a time, in wholehearted obedience to what we know of the will of God. Then - as we obey - God will lead us in a right path, caring for the details of our lives. I. ABRAHAM'S SERVANT 1. Obedience We see in Genesis 24:2 that Abraham's servant was not a young man. Yet he was obedient to his master. Abraham instructed that the servant was to find a wife for Isaac from his own people. Likewise, Christians are instructed not to be mismatched with non-Christians (2 Corinthians 6:14). Although he had his own ideas about the difficulty of the task confronting him (Genesis 24:5), the servant did not disobey. The Apostle Peter instructs, ""Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to the kind and gentle but also to the overbearing"" (1Peter 2:18). God does instruct us how to conduct ourselves in our various human relationships. As we obey those who have authority over us: parents, teachers, employers and the like, we are also obeying God. And as we obey God, He entrusts us with a little bit more in His service. This is what Jesus means when He says, ""Every one to whom much is given, of him will much be required"" (Luke 12:48). 2. Praying for guidance (Genesis 24:12-14) If we really want to know what areas of service the Lord may be opening up to us in our lives, we not only need to be living a life of obedience in our present circumstances, but we must also be seeking God's will by prayer. This is our talking with God, asking Him to unfold the details of our lives. It is also a listening to God. The servant asked God for something lawful that enabled him to carry out his duty to his master. It is significant, too, that he asked out of God's love for his master Abraham (Genesis 24:12). When we pray, we pray in the Name of Jesus Christ. Abraham's servant was walking in faith, and reached a level of holy boldness in his request for a visible token of God's guidance (Genesis 24:14). But it is sufficient for most of us, most of the time, to simply ask God what His will is, and to say with His Son, ""Thy will be done!"" 3. God answers prayer (Genesis 24:15) ""Before he had done speaking..."" (Genesis 24:15). Before the words of our prayer leave our lips, God is already moving heaven and earth to fulfil His purposes in us, and through us. The servant was in the right place at the right time, because God had led him there, heard his prayer, and brought Rebecca there in answer to that prayer."
Colossians 2:1-5,"('Mystery Of Christ', 'Mystery Of God', 'Wisdom And Understanding', 'Cults And False Religions')",Independent/Bible," Full Disclosure of the Mystery of God Colossians 2:1-5 We begin Chapter 2 of Paul's letter to the Colossians, but this does not begin a different topic in Paul's letter; it is clearly a continuation attacking the false influences which beset that church and churches in the surrounding area, and false teachings which still plague the Church today. We read Colossians 2:1-5: 1 ""For I want you to know what a great conflict (struggle or battle) I have for you and those in Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh, 2 that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, and attaining to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the knowledge of the mystery of God, both of the Father and of Christ, 3 in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. 4 Now this I say lest anyone should deceive you with persuasive words. 5 For though I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ."" History of Paul's Deep Spiritual Struggle Paul was experiencing a great spiritual struggle concerning spiritual attacks on the Church, even though he never met most of those believers to whom he is writing. There was much cultural pressure being exerted upon the churches in that area, even as there is throughout the world today. As is the case with most cults and sects, false religions and worldly philosophies, they taught that there were ""hidden secrets"", ""mysteries"" and practices concerning a relationship with God. False religions contain worthless mysteries and secrets not found in Christ or supported in His Word. False religions and philosophies contain non-Biblical false teachings. If a teaching is not mentioned and affirmed in the Word of God, the Bible, it is not doctrine. False teachers many times take one verse from the Bible which is not affirmed anywhere else in the Bible and develop a teaching from it. This type of doctrine is not acceptable and should not be taught. In contemporary Colossae, there were many worldly teachings being developed which attempted to combine faith in Christ with extra-biblical knowledge and manmade principles. 2 Peter 3:15-16 warned of this: ""Consider that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation--as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, has written to you, 16 as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which untaught and unstable people twist to their own destruction, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures."" It was natural with such teachings to worship false gods, or to worship knowledge or wisdom instead of the One who is Wisdom, the Lord Jesus Christ. The contemporary pressure being applied to Colossae was to worship and pray to angels, who are merely creatures made by God. False gods include placing any man or any created being or thing on a level equal to God Himself. The apostle John made it so clear that to worship any God other than the God of the Bible is to worship falsely."

"Romans 13:12-14, Acts 1:12-14","('Upper Room', 'Unity In Christ', 'Mount Called Olivet', ""Sabbath Day's Journey"", 'One Accord')",Baptist, Corinthians 1.12-," May 20, 2013 By: Tom Lowe Lesson I.B.1: The Apostles and Others Gathered in Jerusalem Acts 1.12-14 (KJV) 12 Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey. 13 And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. 14 These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren. Commentary Then returned they unto Jerusalem In Luke 24:52, we are told ""they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy."" The act of worship referred to here is probably when they gazed intently as their Lord ascended into the clouds until He disappeared from their view. That experience, and then the angels telling them that He will return in the same manner must have filled them with joy. ""They"" were the eleven disciples (the twelve minus Judas); along with Mary, the mother of Jesus, the brothers of Jesus (James and Jude), the women who followed Jesus, and others; who when added up amounted to about 120--""And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)"" (Acts 1:15; KJV). Their obedience is remarkable, because they could have returned to their homes; but instead, they went into Jerusalem where more of their enemies lived than in any other place. They were obedient to their Lord, who told them to return to Jerusalem and wait for the coming of the Holy Spirit, and that is exactly what they did. Jesus' orders were fresh on their minds, since they had just heard Him say it; therefore, they actually did what Jesus told them to do even though He was no longer physically present with them. from the mount called Olivet, ""The mount called Olivet,"" was on the east side of Jerusalem and about two miles distant, and Christ had often gone there, and from there he ascended to heaven. This is the hill which in 1 Kings 11:7 is said to be ""before Jerusalem""--""Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem...""(1 Kings 11.7;KJV); and in Zechariah 14:4 it is expressly said to be ""before Jerusalem on the east""--""And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east..."" (Zech 14:4; KJV); and when Jesus sat down there to converse with His disciples, he is said to be over against the temple--""And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately"" (Mark 13:3; KJV). It got its name from the huge number of olive trees which grew there. The Jewish writers sometimes called it, ""the Mount of Oil"" because of the olive oil, which was made out of the olives that grew upon the trees. It is said, that in an old edition of the Latin version of this text it is called ""the Mountain of Three Lights""; and this reason is given for it, ""because on the west side it was enlightened in the night by the continual fire of the altar in the temple; and on the east side it had the first beams of the sun before the city was enlightened with them; and it produced plenty of olives, by which the light is maintained in the lamps."" Josephus relates that in the earthquake in the times of Uzziah, half part of this mountain, which was to the west, was divided from it, and was rolled four furlongs to the eastern part of it, so that the ways and king's gardens were stopped up."
1 Timothy 3:8-11,"('Jesus', 'Growth', 'Maturity', 'Spiritual Maturity', 'Serve')",Assembly Of God, Tim 3:8-," My calling- End of summer 1999 I was listening to a sermon on being a bondservant when God called me to the ministry with the words ""Study to show yourself approved, and I will make you a minister to my people"" Many of you have heard my testimony of my calling, but one part I didn't mention was this- I spent the next 30 min, and many years after questioning God on the wisdom of choosing me to be a pastor. After all, I had quite a past, and most of it was very public knowledge- I was a drunkard- I had wasted my high school years pursing the next bout of intoxication with alcohol and occasionally drugs. IF I had applied myself I could have been an honor roll student but I wasted the gift God had given me for partying A fornicator. I had the ""Oscar"" syndrome- my self-worth was tied into how many women I could sleep with. In fact, looking back into my family history there hasn't been an Oscar who had held a marriage together in 4 generations due to infidelity. Hardly a qualification for the ministry. A thief- I have a conviction for shoplifting. The only way I could get new shoes or clothes for school was to steal them. Same thing with school supplies or food some days. A liar- lying used to be reflexive to me. IF anyone questioned me about something I did or said I'd automatically lie about it. Ironically, it was my mom who taught me this at an early age when she had an abusive boyfriend- if you are doing something you shouldn't be doing, always have a good and believable story ready in case he questions you about it. These were just a few of the things I brought to God's attention on why I can't be called to be a pastor- In my thinking at that time God was calling me to be a spiritual superman when I'm not even a good Clark Kent. After spending time arguing with God I spoke to my senior pastor at the time. He encouraged me to pursue the call of God reminding me that God does not call the qualified, God qualifies the called. So we are going to look at the calling of God today, and start with one of the ways people can serve in the Kingdom, and that position is of deacon. 1 Tim 3:8-11 8 In the same way, deacons m are to be worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain. 9 They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience. 10 They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons. 11 In the same way, the women are to be worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything. 12 A deacon must be faithful to his wife and must manage his children and his household well. 13 Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus. Prayer The first thing I want to say this morning is this, and it's critical you understand this- Everyone has a call of God upon their lives. Yes, even you. God created you for a purpose. Pew sitting is not a spiritual gift nor a position to aspire to in God's Kingdom. You were saved to serve in His Kingdom. After accepting Jesus as Lord and Savior, this is nothing more important for your eternal soul than finding your place of service in His Kingdom."

"Genesis 17:1-2, Proverbs 18:7-23:7","('Omnipotent', 'God Is Ever Present', 'God Is All Powerful', 'God Is All Knowing')",Pentecostal," WALKING WITH THE LORD Genesis 17:1-3, Philippians 3:10 People are strategic about everything they want to accomplish, notwithstanding they lack plans to know the God that knows their imperfection. They get frustrated after all effort exerted in their cause of planning. Take for eg, If we want to loose weight or attain a particular status in our goals and achievement we follow some specific orders as given by our coach or mentor. I can remember in my life, I was so passionate about my soccer career and my dream to be a great professional, I persistently with a lot of focus and time disciplined myself and work tirelessly even when I was a on the verge of giving up, notwithstanding I would still summoned courage and say I can do it and before you know I am on to it. Specifically there was this set day I came from training, so exhausted that I fell on a bench right before my apartment to rest not knowing it wasn't my bed and my grand mom woke me and said son, why are you exerting much pressure into this soccer of yours, don't you have other specific things to do like getting a job or school certificate and I was upset and ignored her like a common saying goes 'What concerns conductor or car loader with overload or others might say while are you taking panadol for my headache. To cut a long story short I was affected with an eyes effection due to the much pressure and not properly feeding well, however a closer associate of like mind (soccer player like myself) on narrating my ordeal to him, quickly told me agitatively in my face stop wasting time, can't you see with all your effort you aren't getting any further, go and look for job. I said to my self, I don't need advice from anyone again acknowledging the fact that no one sees my passion nor feels my pain, therefore i set up a new plan of prioritising Him (Jesus) and by His grace I was able to come up as a proffessional soccer player in the subsequent years of my career. Why am I revealing this , like many of us planning and strategising for a better future until we develop a closer relationship with the Lord , we might be victims of the wrong crowd. I had a great passion but my motivation and mandate has to change from self to God's. Proverb 19:21 straightly puts it God is more interested and willing to perform His will for your life than your motive. No matter how beautiful and glamoring your motive can be if it is void of the prioritise order of the Lord it will all amount to frustration and at most regrets. I was listening to an ordeal of a mom and what hapoen to her kid. They went to a specific restaurant and the child requested for fried cat fish and when it was brought before him with smiles he looks up and questioned the waitress ""Excuse me madam, is this fish from cat and everyone including my very self was laughing and he was infuriated and frustratedly weeping. Like every one of us we are sometimes like that kid because though we ask but our question is totally out of place we dont recieve answer from God, note James says we ask but arent recieving because we ask amiss and like Mathew 6:33: puts it"

About a quarter before nine, while the leader was describing the change which God works through faith in Christ? I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ alone for salvation, and an assurance was given me that He had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death."" 2. Transforming moment for Martin Luther: a capsule summary of Paul's message to the Romans changed Martin Luther forever.

Privileged so much they didn't know what to say."" 6(He did not know what to say, they were so frightened.) 6. Privileged to hear a voice saying: ""This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!"" 4. It is not until later after the Transforming Moment that they know their Privilege would now become an Obligation: 1. Obligation for Peter to serve God at a Great Cost John 21:Jesus said, ""Feed my sheep. 18I tell you the truth, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go."" 19Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God.Then he said to him, ""Follow me!"" 2. Obligation for James was the first of the twelve to face Martyrdom. Herod Acts 12: 2He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword. 3. Obligation for John sent to an Island Rev 1:9I, John, your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus 4.

"2 Timothy 1:7-8, Exodus 14:14","('Faith', 'Fear', 'Love  Of God', 'Spirit Of Power')",Pentecostal," We continue in our series on Discovering your Destiny and today we are going to be thinking about how we can conquer our fears. ----- Dictionary.com defines fear in these ways: NOUN: A distressing emotion aroused by impending danger, evil, pain, etc., whether the threat is real or imagined; the feeling or condition of being afraid. Concern or anxiety. Something that causes feelings of dread or apprehension; something a person is afraid of. Reverential awe, especially toward God. Anticipation of the possibility that something unpleasant will occur. VERB: To regard with fear; be afraid of. To have reverential awe of. To consider or anticipate (something unpleasant) with a feeling of dread or alarm. There is a website called fearof.net that lists the 100 most common fears or phobia that people can suffer from. The Top 10 are: 1. Arachnophobia - The fear of spiders. 2. Ophidiophobia - The fear of snakes. 3. Acrophobia - The fear of heights. 4. Agoraphobia - The fear of open or crowded spaces. 5. Cynophobia - The fear of dogs. Everything from small Poodles to large Great Danes. 6. Astraphobia - The fear of thunder/lightning. 7. Claustrophobia - The fear of small spaces like elevators, small rooms and other enclosed spaces. 8. Mysophobia - The fear of germs. 9. Aerophobia - The fear of flying. 10. Trypophobia - The fear of holes is an unusual but pretty common phobia. Then there are a few more further down the chart that caught my eye. 17. Alektorophobia - The fear of chickens. 25. Gamophobia - The fear of commitment. 26. Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia - The fear of long words. 34. Globophobia - The fear of balloons 37. Phobophobia - The fear of fear. 60. Achondroplasiaphobia - The fear of midgets. 74. Pogonophobia - The fear of beards. If you read or watch the news it seems that there are also many other things that much of the world seems to fear at the moment, Brexit, Trump, ISIS, house prices, the rising cost of food, so many things that can create fear. Fear can hold us back in every area of our lives. Fear can hold us back in our Christian walk. Fear is the opposite of faith. Are you gripped by fear or do you have a confident faith in God? Listen to the words of the Apostle Paul in 2 Timothy 1:7-8 For God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline. So never be ashamed to tell others about our Lord. Fear is something the enemy uses against us. But we can learn how to defend ourselves against fear. God has provided us with a gift to overcome fear - a spirit of power, love and self-disciple. By faith we have the ability to overcome fear. The words of Moses in Exodus 14:14 are still relevant to us today ""The Lord Himself will fight for you. Just stay calm."" God fights our battles. When we are confident in the fact that God fights our battles, fear cannot grip us. There are many verses in the Bible that teach us we should have faith in God rather than fear of circumstances and situations. Need some examples? Jeremiah 1:8 ""And don't be afraid of the people, for I will be with you and will protect you. I, the Lord, have spoken!"""
Mark 1:16-20,"('Service', 'Invitation', 'Called To Be Fishers', 'Obedience In Faith')",Baptist," Assembling a Team Mark 1: 16-20 Following His baptism, wilderness temptation, and public introduction in Galilee, Jesus continued His work here on earth. One of the first priorities was to assemble a team of men to walk with Him, whom He could teach and prepare for ministry. In our text Jesus has passed by some common fishermen and extended the call to follow Him. This common, humble Man from Galilee was seeking men to serve alongside Him. He didn't go to the Temple or the Synagogues; Jesus went out among the world to find disciples. He was more concerned with their heart than their heredity. He sought those with passion rather than prestige. He chose men of faith instead of men of fame. Jesus continues to seek the same characteristics in the lives of believers today. Our ability to know and serve the Lord is not based upon, or limited to our possessions, our positions, or our prominence. Jesus is looking for those who have a desire to serve Him. I want to look at the insights of this divine encounter with Jesus as we consider: Assembling a Team. I. Their Calling (17) - And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. The call that Jesus extended was very simple, but it reveals several things to us. Notice: A. The Invitation - Come ye after me. These men had already met Jesus. They were familiar with who He was and even regarded Him as the Messiah, (John 1: 35-42.) That initial encounter with Jesus would not be the last. Jesus has returned unto them with an invitation to follow Him in service. He wanted these men to come and work alongside Him. I rejoice to know that Jesus doesn't just come by or speak once and that is it. He is not obligated to speak more than once, but often He passes by again and again seeking the hearts of men. Just as it was with the disciples, we too must hear and heed the call of our Lord. In this passage, these men have received an invitation to service. But, before that invitation can be offered, one must accept the invitation for salvation. You have likely heard an invitation from the Lord. Whatever He desires of you, I would encourage you to respond and follow Him. We can't respond without an invitation. Salvation and our service unto the Lord is not something we choose the timing or decide the direction. John 6:44 - No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day. We must listen as the Lord invites us unto Him. B. The Intention - Come ye after me, and I will make you...fishers of men. Jesus was very clear in His desire for these men. (He is always clear regarding His desire for our lives. It often requires prayer and commitment to understand, but the will of God is not vague.) He had a specific work for them to do and revealed His intention for their lives. This was a specific call to the disciples, and yet it is the same call all hear from the Lord. It is His desire that all serve as fishers of men. The Lord wants us to be a witness and bear His testimony among the world. There is not a one, who has ever been saved, that the Lord did not desire to be a witness and reach others for His glory!"
Acts 1:15-20,"('Judas', 'Bowels Burst Out', 'Field Of Blood')",Baptist,cts 1:15-," May 23, 2013 By: Tom Lowe Series: The Early Church Title: Judas' Apostatizing Fulfilled Acts 1.15-20 (KJV) 15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,) 16 Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus. 17 For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry. 18 Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out. 19 And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. 20 For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take. Commentary And in those days ""In those days"" refers here to the days between the ascension of Jesus and the day of Pentecost, when the disciples were waiting for the coming of the Holy Spirit. The Ethiopic version reads, ""On that day,"" which makes it sound as if it was the same day they came back to Jerusalem after watching Jesus ascend to heaven, and went into the upper room; and this is very likely since there was no time to be lost in choosing someone to replace Judas. Peter stood up ""Peter stood up"" means Peter standing up, or rising. This is a customary expression in the Scriptures when one begins to do something, ""I will arise and go to my father..."" (Luke 15:18; KJV). Peter, was respected as the chief apostle, since he was usually the first one to act in almost any situation, and he was willing to show his zeal for Christ, whom he had recently denied; he was the senior man in the company of apostles, as well as the principle minister to the Jews. He rises to his feet like people used to do, when they were about to address an assembly; which was done to show respect and reverence to those they addressed. It was no surprise, then, when Peter stood up and introduced the business of electing a new apostle. Note: Teachers and those of superior rank were always seated when addressing a group, but Peter did not want to give that kind of impression; he only wanted to make a motion. in the midst of the disciples, ""The disciples"" was the name given to them because they were students in the school of Jesus Christ--""And seeing the multitudes, He went up on a mountain, and when He was seated His disciples came to Him"" (Matt 5:1; NKJV). Again, among the Jews, the common position when teaching was for the teacher to set and the learners to stand. The Coptic, Ethiopic, Armenian, and Vulgate versions replace ""disciples"" with ""brethren."" This seems to be the best rendering, because of what immediately follows, since he was not only among the twelve disciples when he stood-up, but among the whole company, which amounted to one hundred and twenty. It may only be a coincidence that this was the number which the Jews required to form a council (Sanhedrin) in any city; but it is more likely that the disciples had gathered together, with themselves, one hundred and twenty believers, chosen from the many who had been converted by the ministry of our Lord; it may have included the seventy-two whom he had sent forth to preach (See Luke 10:1); therefore they formed a complete council to conduct the important business of electing a person to replace Judas."
Matthew 6:1-33,"('Tithing', 'Responsibilities')",Baptist," A. INTRODUCTION: MATTHEW 6:1-4 1. What is most imperative? (Three lessons from Matthew 6). "" ""When you give"" (Matt. 6:2-3) - Relationship to others. "" ""When you pray"" (Matt. 6:5-6) - Relationship to God. "" ""When you fast"" (Matt. 6:16-17) - Relationship to things. 2. How do we do the imperative? ""But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you"" (6:33). Give ourselves primarily to God in all things. ""Be careful that you don't do good deeds publicly to impress people, because that will not be rewarded by your Father in Heaven. When you give don't brag like the two-faced hypocrites. Don't blow a trumpet in church or the neighborhood to call attention to yourself. Those who do that have got all the reward they're going to get. Give secretly and spontaneously so your left hand won't realize what your right hand is giving. Your Father who knows all secrets will reward you according to the sincerity of your heart"" (Matt. 6:1-4). B. TEN NEGATIVES IN GIVING 1. Don't give to get attention from people. ""Don't do good deeds to impress others (6:1, ELT). 2. Don't let people control what you give. ""To be seen of them"" (6:1). 3. Don't be hypocritical in giving. Word hypocrite means two-faced, as an actor. 4. Don't call attention to your gift. ""Do not announce it with a trumpet"" (6:2). 5. Don't let pride govern the amount or timing of your gift. ""That they may have glory"" (6:2). 6. Don't forget the real focus of giving. ""Gifts of mercy"" (6:1, Amplified). 7. Don't forget the motive of your giving. ""Your Father in heaven"" 6:1). 8. Don't lose your rightful reward. ""Your Father who sees in secret will Himself reward you openly"" (6:4). 9. Don't calculate what you will get out of it. ""Do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing"" (6:3). 10. Don't get God mad at you. ""No reward from your Father in heaven"" (6:1). C. TEN RESPONSIBILITIES IN GIVING 1. You are in control of your money. ""When you give . . ."" (6:2). 2. You give according to what you have, your giving is not related to the things you don't have. a. Time, we all have opportunity. b. Talent, we all have abilities God can use. c. Treasure, we all have some resources. 3. You give according to what you know. ""To be seen"" (6:1); ""know"" (6:3). 4. You are responsible to direct your giving. ""When you give . . ."" 5. You give according to need. ""Charitable deed"" (6:3). 6. You give timely. ""Sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart"" (1 John 3:17); (a) can't be responsible when you don't know need, (b) give according to its urgency. 7. You give proportionately; (a) you can't give what you don't have, (b) you can't give more than what you have, (c) you must give to your family first, ""if anyone does not provide for his own . . . household . . . is worse than an unbeliever"" (1 Tim. 5:8)."
Matthew 6:5-15,"('Prayer', 'Worthship')",Baptist," A. WHAT IS PRAYER? MATTHEW 6:5-15 1. Prayer is relationship with your heavenly Father. ""For your Father knows"" (6:8). ""Our Father in heaven"" (6:9). 2. Prayer is not getting God to do what you desire, but you changing to God's desire. 3. Prayer is total confidence in God's planned purpose for you. ""Your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask"" (6:8). B. SEVEN THINGS NOT TO DO IN PRAYER 1. Don't pray for human praise. ""You shall not be like the hypocrites"" (6:5). 2. Don't call attention to your prayers. ""They love to pray, studying in the synagogues and . . . streets"" (6:5). 3. Don't repeat prayers for human attention. ""That they may be seen of man"" (6:5). 4. Don't misuse prayer in public places. ""Standing in the synagogues . . . street corners"" (6:5). Where The Early Church Prayed "" Prayed together - Acts 2:42 "" Prayed out loud - Acts 4:24-31 "" Prayed privately - Matt. 6:6 "" Two prayed - Acts 16:25 "" Prayed outside - Acts 3;6 "" Prayed in homes - Acts 12:12 "" Prayed in persecution - Acts 7:55-60 5. Don't make a show of prayer. ""Enter into thy closet"" (6:6). 6. Don't pray without thinking or meaning. ""Use not vain repetitions"" (6:7). Repetition is battalogeo, i.e., speaking without thinking. 7. Don't measure the effectiveness of your prayer by its length. ""Think that they will be heard for their many words"" (6:7). C. INTRODUCTION TO THE LORD'S PRAYER 1. Technically the apostles' prayer, because Jesus' prayer is in John 17. 2. Why doesn't it begin or end with ""In Jesus' name?"" It does, ""Our"" means ""Jesus and me."" 3. Jesus teaches us that the powerful Elohim-Yahewh of the Old Testament is an intimate Father. 4. The 62 words of the Lord's Prayer contain everything we need to know about God and ask of Him. Just as an entire oak tree is in one acorn, so all of Christianity is hidden in the Lord's Prayer. D. THE SEVEN PETITIONS OF THE LORD'S PRAYER THE THREE ""THY"" PETITIONS 1. Thy Name be holy. (a) The word hallowed means Holy which is purity, (b) Holy tells us to show reverence in His presence, (c) Holy demands our worship. Worship is giving the worthship to God that belongs to Him. 2. Thy Kingdom come. Kingdom represents God's effective rule in our life on earth, as He rules Heaven. God has a plan to rule this earth. 3. Thy will be done. This is a prayer of yieldedness. God has a plan for my life. I must pray to find it and do it. A SEMI-CONCLUSION - ""ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN"" 4. The Hinge Petition: give us provision and strength for today. (a) Bread is a symbol word that stands for what it gives; life, strength and satisfaction, (b) Now, one day at a time. THE THREE ""US"" PETITIONS 5. Forgive us our debts. (a) Sins have human consequences that are our debt, (b) We are not perfect, neither are others; so they will forgive you, if you forgive them: but you go first."
"Isaiah 6:1-5, Judges 6:11-27","('Holiness', 'Character Of God')",Christian/Church Of Christ," Do you know what a caricature is? You see them all the time when you pick up a newspaper. You often have political cartoons where the details are not true life representations. Prominent features are often exaggerated and non-prominent features are diminished or eliminated altogether. If you go to a fair you often will see an artist who will do a caricature of you and your loved one. If your chin is slightly pointy, it will be very long and pointy. If you have thin lips, they will be non-existent. It will look like you without question. But it will not be a true representation of you. It can make you wonder, ""Is this how people see me?"" We have caricatures of God. There are many of them floating around. J.B. Phillips wrote a marvelous little book entitled, ""Your God is too small."" In it he deals with the various limited ideas we have of God. To some, God is a resident policeman. To others, God is a divine grandfather not capable of a violent thought. Then there is the ""god in a box."" Whenever we need him, we take him out of the box. Then there is the ""Managing Director"" view of God. He takes care of all the big things of the universe, but he is not concerned about me. And the list can go on and on. I. The Main Characteristic of God - Holiness Who is God? If I were to ask you what his most prominent characteristic is, what would you say? The Bible declares he is love. It also said he is light and in him is no darkness at all. It tells us that he is eternal. He is good. He is gracious and merciful. He is just. But what is the main characteristic of God? It is the only one in scripture named in triplicate. God is ""holy holy holy."" All of the other characteristics of God flow from this one characteristic. His love is holy love. He mercy is holy mercy. His wrath is holy wrath. The Bible never says God is love love love. It never says he is wrath wrath wrath. But it does say more than once that he is holy holy holy. What does it mean to be holy? The root idea behind the world ""holy"" is different or set apart. The Bible often says that we are to be holy ""to"" the Lord, which means we are dedicated to the Lord. We have been cleaned up, and our purpose is now a distinct and special one. We are to serve the Lord. But what does it mean to say God is holy? How is God ""set apart?"" When the Bible speaks of his holiness, it is talking about his other-ness. 1 Sam 2:2 declares, ""there is no one holy like the Lord."" God is God, not a man. There is nothing else like him in all the universe. No one is holy like him. How do you put his holiness into words? I'm not sure you can. There is a song in our books that declares - ""O boundless love divine, how shall this tongue of mine to wondering mortals tell the matchless grace divine (267)."" Indeed, how can we fully express the holiness of God? How can we fully understand the holiness of God? At best, both our understanding and telling of it will be an imperfect glimpse of his glorious holiness. The few times God revealed his holiness in scripture, it was hard to put it into words. It forever changed the lives of those who saw. It was often a traumatic experience to be confronted with the holiness of God. Let's look at one of those."
"1 Samuel 6:19-7:2, 2 Samuel 6:1-23","('Joy', 'Holiness')",Christian/Church Of Christ," Last week we saw that the number one characteristic of God is that he is holy. We need to understand this about God so we can make sure we are worshipping him and not some caricature of him we have made up in our mind. Do you know what a caricature is? We usually think of it as a picture, such as a political cartoon or drawing at a fair where someone exaggerates some features of another person. It is curious how it works, because even though it is not a true to life representation, you can tell who it is. People do the same thing with God. What we will see from the texts we will read this morning is that serving a caricature of God can be disastrous. So that is why we begin once again with God's holiness. The epicenter of God's holiness in Israel was the Ark of the covenant. It was the most holiest object in the most holy place in Israel. Why was it so holy? It was the place where the glory of God dwelt. He sat enthroned above the Cherubim. So when the Philistines defeated the Philistines in battle, the Israelites were puzzled. So they brought the Ark from its sanctuary in Shiloh out to their encampment on the battlefield. The Philistines were terrified. They had heard of the exploits of Yahweh and how he smote the Egyptians. So they fought with all their might, defeated Israel and captured the ark. This was a gloomy day for Israel. How could this happen? Why did it happen? The glory of God had departed Israel! The Philistines take the Ark back to Ashdod and set it in their own temple with Dagon. They had captured a most powerful God. With BOTH Yahweh and Dagon together, nothing could defeat them. They were now invincible. However, the next morning, their god Dagon had toppled over on his face. They had to set their God back up again. They should have nailed him down to make sure he didn't fall again. The next morning, not only was Dagon prostrated before the presence of Yahweh, he was broken too. Then the plagues and pestilence started. They knew it was because they had the Ark which didn't belong to them. So they sent it to Gath, and the same thing happened there. So the leaders of Gath sent the Ark away to Ekron. The people of Ekron cried out when they say the Ark coming. They didn't want it and the distasters it would bring. So they sent the Ark back to Israel on a cart. After seven month in Philistia, the Ark came home. Imagine the joy of the Israelites as the men of Beth Shemesh saw the Ark returning. They were overjoyed to see it. Can you imagine the cheering and the celebration? God was back! Their celebration came to an abrupt halt. 1 Sam 6:19-20 - ""He struck down some of the men of Beth-shemesh because they had looked into the ark of the Lord. He struck down of all the people, 50,070 men, and the people mourned because the Lord had struck the people with a great slaughter. The men of Beth-shemesh said, ""Who is able to stand before the Lord, this holy God? And to whom shall He go up from us?"""" That is more than the number of people in Leavenworth and Lansing combined! Their joy turned to fear."
Matthew 6:16-18,"('Discipline', 'Fasting')",Baptist," A. INTRODUCTION: MATTHEW 6:16-18 ""When you fast, don't make it obvious to others, as the hypocrites who try to look mournful or disheveled like they didn't comb their hair, or wash their face. Don't try to get people to admire you for fasting. That is the only reward you will get. But when you fast, arrange your hair and shave so no one will suspect you are fasting, except your heavenly Father who knows everything you do. Then your Father who sees what you do in secret will reward you openly"" (Matt. 6:16-18). 1. Fasting is a spiritual discipline for inward communion with God, or deep contrition against temptation, when you go without food to demonstrate your sincerity to God. 2. Fasting without prayer is not enough, ""However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting"" (Matt. 17:21). 3. Required for all on the Day of Atonement. ""On the appointed day . . . you must spend the day fasting and not do any work"" (Lev. 16:29, LB). 4. A Yom Kippur fast is from sundown to sundown, giving up the evening meal, breakfast and lunch. B. 10 NEGATIVES OF FASTING ""When you fast, be not . . ."" (6:16). 1. It's not giving up food; it is a relationship with God. 2. It's not about getting things from God, it is knowing God. 3. It's not a testimony to others, ""Appear not unto men to fast"" (6:18). 4. It's not turning your back on pleasure, it is finding pleasure in God. 5. It's not meritorious, it is willingly. 6. It's not about wearing clothes, i.e., sack cloth. 7. It's not about mournful gestures, i.e., ashes. ""Disfigure their face"" was actually ""make face unappeasable,"" or neglected. 8. It's not what we give up. 9. It's not about what others will think. 10. It's not about making it through. C. 10 POSITIVES FROM FASTING 1. You will establish an honest relationship with God. 2. You will get answers to your prayer-ask (Is. 58:6, 9). 3. You will eliminate barriers between you and God. ""They gathered . . . and fasted . . . and said, we have sinned against the Lord"" (1 Sam. 7:6). 4. You will break addictions and bad habits. ""To loose the bands of wickedness"" (Is. 58:6). 5. You intercede for others. ""They gathered . . . and fasted . . . cease not to cry unto the Lord our God for us"" (1 Sam. 7:6, 8). 6. You will get spiritual insight. ""Is not this the fast I have chosen . . . then your light shall spring forth"" (Is. 58:6, 8). 7. You will get spiritual protection. ""Is not this the fast I have chosen . . . the Lord shall be your rear guard"" (Is. 58:6, 8). 8. You will get physical healing. ""Is not this the fast . . . healing shall spring forth"" (Is. 58:6, 8). 9. Your spiritual warfare. ""I ate no pleasant food, no meat or wine came into my mouth . . . but the prince of Persia withstood me twenty-one days"" (Daniel 10:3, 13). 10. You energize missions outreach. ""Having fasted and prayed . . . they sent them (missionaries) away"" (Acts 13:3)."
John 1:1-18,"('Jesus', 'Son Of God')",Christian/Church Of Christ," Many, many people have heard of Jesus. But many people really do not know who Jesus is. Was he some ancient sage? Was a he merely a religious teacher? Who is this Jesus? Many have an opinion about Jesus. But do you know how much my opinion is worth? It is worth no more than your opinion. In fact, it is worthless compared to the only authority for who Jesus is, which is God's word. Not my word, not your word, but God's word. So, we will look at what God's word says about Jesus. 1) Jesus existed before his birth ""In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being by Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being. ...And the word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth. John bore witness of Him, and cried out, saying, 'This was He of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me''."" (John 1:1-15) This passage makes it clear that Jesus was there with God in the beginning. This could explain why God says ""Let us make man in our image"" instead of ""Let me make man in my image"" in Genesis 1-2. There is also another passage that speaks of the existence of Christ before his birth: ""But as for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, Too little to be among the clans of Judah, From you One will go forth for Me to be ruler in Israel. His goings forth are from long ago, from the days of eternity."" (Micah 5:2) This was a prophecy that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem (Matthew 2:1-6). Notice the affirmation that Jesus existed from ""the days of eternity."" "" 'Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad.' The Jews therefore said to Him, 'You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?' Jesus said to them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am.' "" (John 8:56-58). Jesus was around before Abraham. He didn't say I was, but I am. 2) Jesus is God This is a difficult concept to grasp. How could Jesus be God? The Bible teaches that there is only one God (Deuteronomy 6:1-3). Does this mean there is more than one God if Jesus is God too? The answer is no. According to Ephesians 4:6, there is ""one God and Father over all . . ."". But notice in Ephesians 4:5, it says that there is ""one Lord . . ."". Is this talking about one and the same thing? The answer is no. The term Lord was often used in the New Testament as a Title for Jesus. The term ""Father"" is never used for Jesus. Jesus and the Father are one, but they are not the same. Consider the following passages of scripture: ""In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being by Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being. ...And the word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth. John bore witness of Him, and cried out, saying, 'This is He of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me."" (John 1:1-3, 14-15) This passage tells of the ""word"" who was with God and was himself God. He created the universe and later became ""flesh"" and lived among us. John the Baptist prepared the way for the Word that had become flesh."
Matthew 1:18-25,"('Christmas', 'Jesus', 'Incarnation')",Christian/Church Of Christ," Have you every heard of Heavenly beans? Little Carried thought that this time of year was for heavenly beans because people sing about it everywhere. The song, Silent Night, that ends with the line, ""sleep in heavenly beans."" Was her favorite song. Carrie's brother corrected her. He said, ""do you ever see beans at Christmas? Of course not! That's because it is no ""heavenly beans."" It is, ""sleep in heavenly peas."" That is a commentary about how you can hear something over and over again and still not get it. It seems in the last ten to fifteen years, there has been a surge of interest in Biblical stories. Movies about Jesus and other Bible characters have been increasing. Most of them just don't get it. I used to say that people were more comfortable with Jesus' divinity than his humanity. I perceive that this is beginning to shift. Many of the portrayals of Jesus portray his humanity more than his divinity. I believe that the greatest misunderstanding this time of year is not that Jesus was born on December 25th, because he most likely was not. I don't believe that the greatest misunderstanding is that Christmas is an official Christian holiday. It is a human tradition not a God-ordained holy day. I believe the greatest misunderstanding has to do with the significance of who Jesus is. Let's look at the announcement given to Joseph in Matthew 1:18-25. ""Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: when His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit. And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man and not wanting to disgrace her, planned to send her away secretly. But when he had considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, ""Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife; for the Child who has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. ""She will bear a Son; and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins."" Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet: ""BEHOLD, THE VIRGIN SHALL BE WITH CHILD AND SHALL BEAR A SON, AND THEY SHALL CALL HIS NAME IMMANUEL,"" which translated means, ""GOD WITH US."" And Joseph awoke from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took {Mary} as his wife, but kept her a virgin until she gave birth to a Son; and he called His name Jesus."" Joseph thought that Mary must have been unfaithful. She was going to have a child, and they were not married yet. An angel of the Lord tells Joseph not to be afraid to take Mary as his wife. She had not been unfaithful. God was at work here and the child was of the Holy Spirit. The text gives us two names to describe Jesus. The angel told Joseph that his name was to be ""Yeshua,"" which means savior or deliverer. Jesus was to save the people from their sins. What had the people's sins done in the past? What did their lying, dishonesty, envy, violence, exploitation, adultery, fornication, murder, bring them? What did their"
1 Corinthians 13:4-8,"('Love', 'Love Of God', 'Love All')",Christian/Church Of Christ," I have been spending a lot of time lately reflecting on the nature of love. There are those that define love in so many ways. There was a time when I would have automatically thought of unbelievers as being the ones who have all of these various ways of defining love. But I have come to realize that many Christians have unknowingly fallen into the trap of defining love according to their own pre-conceived notions, friends, culture, etc. In a recent teen gathering, one of the young men made the distinction between what he described as ""Love,"" and ""Lo-----ve (said with oogly emotions)."" The former is true love, the love that Christ commanded in John 13 when he said, ""I new commandment I give to you, that you love one another as I have love you..."" It is not ""lo-----ve"" that puts butterflies in your stomach, that might be hear this week and gone the next. It is not the puppy love that star struck people have experienced. It is the love that God has demonstrated. I was glad to hear that these young people already beginning to have a good handle on what real love is. But in my experience, I have both seen and heard twisted definitions of love. I still remember Steve's dad, Larry. He was gruff and emotionally abusive. I am not sure if he was every physically, abusive, but it wouldn't have surprised me because sometimes there was evidence of what looked like physical abuse on his wife. This was a man who regularly yelled at his wife and kids. If they didn't get good enough grades, didn't act polite enough, didn't come home on time, or when the kids were younger, if they went across the street, he would yell at them, lecture them, and often demean them in his tone of voice and in what he said. Most of us without hesitation described him as mean and self-centered. Most of his conversations were full of himself. He rarely truly listened to what other people were saying unless it was to use it against them, win an argument, or something like that. The befuddling thing about Larry is that he thought this was okay. He used to tell people that he was trying to care for his family, and at times he would even say it was because he loved them. In reality, he was trying to justify his meanness under the guise that it was love. The reason he was such a hot-head, the reason he could be so mean, the reason he was an unsafe person, according to himself, is because he loved. I eventually learned that his wife, Tammy, had grown up with a Father not unlike Larry and an emotionally and physically distant mother. Tammy never really understood what love was. Her Dad ""loved"" her so much he used to abuse her. It wasn't until Tammy became a Christian that she began to experience Christian love. To make a long story short, she tried to get into some counseling, but Larry refused. Out of concern for her children and herself, for their physical, emotional, and spiritual health, Tammy separated from Larry. Tammy and her kids began to experience Christian love from brethren in the church. It was not harsh, but gentle and kind. At first it frightened her. But as her faith grew, her love grew as well."
Romans 5:12-21,"('Justification', 'Righteousness', 'Defeating Sin', 'Jesus Second Adam')",*other,omans 5:12-21; Matthew 4:1-11; Genesis 2:15-," Title: More than a Reset In Romans 5:12-21 the Apostle Paul reminds us that Jesus came to 1. Defeat Sin 2. Conquer Death and 3. Enable us to reign in righteousness INTRO: Grace and peace from God our Father and from His Son Jesus Christ who came to take away the sin of the world. Have you ever tripped one of the circuit breakers at your house or apartment? Every so often at our house when we begin to use too much electricity outside we trip one of the circuit breakers. It happens because we have put too much of a load on our electrical system and so that a fire doesn't start the system is set up to ""trip"" and stop the flow of electricity. To fix it, all you have to do is to unplug something and then go and reset the button. Once you do that you can continue working outside provided you don't once again use too many appliances. Otherwise you will trip the circuit breaker all over again. There is a limit to how much electrical current you can use outside our house. Resetting that reset button is key. It's the only way to get the electricity to flow again. It's similar to the re-set button that is on some computers or game consoles. You start playing a game or doing something on the computer and suddenly the screen freezes up and you find yourself locked out. Sometimes you can get it to come back on and begin to work but there are those times that you have to hit the reset button and restart your computer or your game. Sadly, it means also that you may have lost some data or the last game but until you hit that reset button you are frozen out anyway. That reboot or reset button is crucial. Some people have viewed our Pauline passage this morning (Romans 5:12-21) in a similar vein. They believe that the Apostle Paul is referring to something like a spiritual reset button for humanity. They believe that what the Apostle Paul is telling us that God, looking at His creation and seeing all the dissolution, the decay of genuine humanness, the brokenness and the death simply through Jesus hit the ""reset button"". They believe that as a result of Jesus' death, resurrection and ascension mankind has been given a ""reset"" in which everything can be put back to square one so to speak. They point out this out by referring to contrasting the work of Adam against the work of Jesus. In Adam they see a life of disobedience which led to judgment and ensuing condemnation. That condemnation resulted in the reign of sin, separation and eventual death. In Jesus Christ they see the very opposite happening. In Christ, they see obedience, grace and justification. In Christ they see a verdict of acquittal that leads to the reign of life, righteousness and oneness in Christ. And while all of those things are in fact going on I would like to propose to all of us this morning a much deeper and richer truth. That deeper and richer truth being that what we see here in our passage and throughout the New Testament is abundantly more than merely a reboot or a reset of our spiritual button. That what we see here and can experience this life goes far beyond that type of dualistic thinking."
Galatians 6:6-10,"('Perseverance', 'Giving', 'Generosity', 'Spiritual Growth')",Evangelical Free," Deron Smith of Springfield, Missouri, is one of many believers around the world who observes Lent, which starts this Wednesday. Not too long ago, he and his wife sat at the dinner table with their three daughters, ages 6, 8, and 11, and attempted to explain what Lent was all about. As part of that explanation, he said, ""Some people like to show they are thinking about what Jesus gave up for us [on the cross] by giving up something they think has become too important to them, like their computers or coffee or dessert or meat or television. It doesn't make God love us more; it just makes us more open to God and less cluttered with our own junk."" Then he told his girls, ""Your mom and I are going to give up all desserts until Easter. We want you girls to think of what you could give up, something that means a lot to you."" Their oldest daughter, following her parents' lead, said, ""I will give up sweets."" ""Me, too,"" their middle daughter chimed in. However, their youngest daughter wasn't very quick with an answer. Her six-year-old mind was working the angles. Finally, she decided and confidently said, ""I want to give up consequences!"" (Deron Smith, Springfield, Missouri; www.PreachingToday.com) Wouldn't we all like to give up consequences? But, alas, that is impossible. To be sure, Christ sets believers free from the law of sin and death. That means you are free to serve one another; you are free to live by the Spirit, and you are free to truly love one another. These are things you could not do before Christ set you free. You are truly free to do so much more than you ever thought possible! But that does not mean you are free from the consequences of your own actions. And that is especially true when it comes to the way you use your money. If you have your Bibles, I invite you to turn with me to Galatians 6, Galatians 6, where the Bible tells you how best to use your money to give you a good return on your investment. Galatians 6:6 Let the one who is taught the word share all good things with the one who teaches. (ESV) Do you want to use your money in the best way possible? Then... SHARE IT. Give some of it to those who have taught you God's word. There is a special relationship that develops between a pastor and his people. There is a special relationship that develops between a teacher and his or her students, especially when it's the Word of God being taught. It's a relationship in which teacher and student share with each other. Now, the word for ""share"" in this passage comes from the Greek word koinoneo, from which we get our word ""fellowship. It literally means to hold things in common, or as it is translated here, ""to share."" In other words, I'm not here to do a job for pay, no. You have invited me as your pastor to share our lives together, to share in ministry together, and to share what we have with each other. I share the Word of God. You share ""all good things"" with your pastor. And we share voluntarily. We share willingly. We share not because we have to by law. We share because we want to out of love."
Matthew 17:1-9,"('Elijah', 'Moses', 'Transfiguration', 'Mountain Top')",Anglican," GOD SHOWS HIS LOVE Romans 5:1-11 Romans 5:8 - ""But God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."" Those who believe in Jesus and put their trust in Him are made right with God. The righteousness of Christ is imputed to them and they are forensically proclaimed ""just"" before God. They are treated just as if they had never sinned, and just as if they had never offended the Almighty. They have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 5:1). They have the hope of heaven within their souls (Romans 5:2). This hope does not disappoint them because God the Holy Spirit pours the love of God into their hearts (Romans 5:5). There is a great outpouring of love from God to man in the self-sacrifice of Jesus (Romans 5:8). This is the whole basis of the Christian's faith and hope. 1. OUR NEED (Romans 5:6) Mankind stands in great need. From the very beginning of the world we have rebelled against God. Collectively, the more we try to put things right, the worse mess we make of this beautiful world that God has created. Individually, we find that we cannot know true peace of mind in our daily lives. Spiritually, we are ""dead in trespasses and sins"" (Ephesians 2:1). We cannot change the world. We cannot change ourselves. What is to be done? It is here that God breaks into history: ""While we were still weak, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly"" (Romans 5:6). 2. GOD'S PERFECT TIME (Romans 5:6) The whole of history pivots on the single event of the death of Jesus. All previous sacrifices point to this one great, ultimate, full, final sacrifice. (a) The Old Testament looks forward to it:- God made a sacrifice in the Garden of Eden in order to provide skins to cover the shame and nakedness of Adam and Eve, the first man and woman (Genesis 3:21). Abraham expressed his faith by saying to his son, ""God will provide Himself a lamb for a burnt offering."" God prevented Abraham from sacrificing his son, and showed him a ram caught in a thicket which he offered instead of his son (Genesis 22:8; Genesis 22:13). [Many centuries later, John the Baptist pointed to Jesus, and said, ""Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!"" (John 1:29). God did not hold back from sacrificing His Son.] Human sacrifice was forbidden in the Law of Moses the man of God, but there was an extensive sacrificial system centred on the tabernacle of the wandering children of Israel, and the Temple in Jerusalem. This all pointed forward to the final sacrifice of God's Son. [The Temple ceased to have any purpose after the death of Jesus, and it was destroyed not many years afterwards.] The Old Testament prophets had much to say about the One who would come, speaking of His death in quite some detail (for example in Psalm 22 and Isaiah 53). These details were often quoted by New Testament writers. (b) The New Testament looks back on the death of Jesus:- We are told in the most famous verse of the whole Bible that ""God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son..."" (John 3:16)."
Ephesians 6:10-19,"('Spiritual Warfare', 'Victory In Jesus', 'Powers Of Darkness', 'Army Of The Lord')",Nazarene," Ephesians 6:10-19 (Please open your Bibles so you can read along) No one likes war unless they are crazy. People die. People suffer. In war one country is the aggressor, sometimes they both are. Are we in a war? I'm not talking about a war against ISIS or the Taliban? Sometimes war is a long, drawn out struggle. With that in mind let's go ahead and read Ephesians 6:10-19 Ephesians 6:12 NIV ""For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms."" Do we have an army? No, we don't, the Lord does. Who is the army? We are supposed to be. What are our weapons? The belt of truth, the breastplate of righteousness in place, the gospel of peace, the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God What is the condition of the army? Sometimes it is good to get an opinion from those who are outside the army: ""To the eastern religious it looks as if Christianity has reached the stage in adolescence when the child is slightly ashamed of his father and embarrassed when talking about him."" - Buddhist Monk ""The church's lips are sealed, its tongues tied, either because we lack a thorough knowledge of the Gospel or a conviction about its truth or both."" - John Stott ""All around us we see Christians and churches relaxing their grasp on the gospel, fumbling it, and in danger of letting it drop from their hands altogether."" - John Stott ""Ours is a non-creedal church not because we have no beliefs but because we will not be restrained in our beliefs...we dare not fence the spirit."" - Wallace Robins - Unitarian Universalist Professor and ""Pastor"" Here is an unrestrained belief from Neale Walsh, ""The fact that God does not care what we do is a sign of how much God loves us, not how little. For freedom to be and to do and have what we choose is the greatest joy of all. It is the biggest treasure and grandest gift that God could give us."" Why has the army of the Lord fallen to such a level of disfunction? Is it because we have reduced salvation to the level of just escaping hell and getting to heaven? Imagine an army that had immeasurable strength but once a person enlisted they went back to the base and hung out with everyone else there until the war was over? Or even worse, once the person enlisted he went back home and lived among the enemy and was so much like them that they didn't even notice him or feel threatened in any way. That is what much of the church is like today. But, let's put a correction to our perspective. The army of the soldiers of the Lord is not a life taking army or a wound giving army; instead it is a life-giving army and a wound healing army. It is an army that goes to those who are spiritually dead and breathes into their dead spiritual lungs the breath of eternal life from the Holy Spirit."
James 3:1-12,"('James', 'Power Of Tongue', 'Practical Living', 'Controlling The Tongue')",Baptist," PRACTICAL CHRISTIAN LIVING #6 - Controlling the Tongue James 3:1 Not many should become teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive a stricter judgment, 2 for we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a mature man who is also able to control his whole body. 3 Now when we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we also guide the whole animal. 4 And consider ships: Though very large and driven by fierce winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs. 5 So too, though the tongue is a small part of the body, it boasts great things. Consider how large a forest a small fire ignites. 6 And the tongue is a fire. The tongue, a world of unrighteousness, is placed among the parts of our bodies. It pollutes the whole body, sets the course of life on fire, and is set on fire by hell. 7 Every sea creature, reptile, bird, or animal is tamed and has been tamed by man, 8 but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. 9 We praise our Lord and Father with it, and we curse men who are made in God's likeness with it. 10 Praising and cursing come out of the same mouth. My brothers, these things should not be this way. 11 Does a spring pour out sweet and bitter water from the same opening? 12 Can a fig tree produce olives, my brothers, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a saltwater spring yield fresh water. INTRO: This morning we will continue in this series through the Book of James on Practical Christian Living. The Book of James was written to help us how to understand our relationship with God and our relationship with each other better; to help us attain spiritual maturity; and to teach us how to live out our Christian faith. Let's review what we've learned so far in this series: In week 1 we learned who James was, whom his letter was written to, the purpose it was written, and the importance of this teaching. In week 2 we learned that our faith will be tested, how to overcome trials, and how to transform the trials of life into triumphs. In week 3 we learned that God calls us to be doers of His Word and not merely hearers - the blessing comes from the doing, not the hearing. In week 4 we were warned about the destructive sin of favoritism, prejudice, racism - we learned how God is not partial, and we learned how a Christian should properly relate to others who are different from us. We learned to recognize that although we may look differently, or come from different places, or belong to different socio-economic groups, we are all ONE in the Body of Christ. Last week, we learned that faith and works go hand in hand. A faith that does not produce the work of Christ within us, is no faith at all. Real faith will always produce the work of Christ. Our faith must be demonstrated through our works. As we continue to move forward through this series, this week we will examine another issue that is a problem area in the lives of most Christian people: CONTROLLING THE TONGUE."

Matthew 17:1-9,"('Transfiguration', 'Do Not Fear')",United Methodist," ""Hiking with Jesus"" Matthew 17:1-9 In the chapter before this morning's Lesson Jesus asked His disciples: ""Who do people say the Son of Man is?"" They came up with a number of answers. Then Jesus asked ""But what about you? Who do you say that I am?"" ""Simon Peter answered, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."" Well, Peter was right... ...but Peter still did not understand what that meant... ...for... ...a couple of verses later when Jesus predicts His death... ""Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. 'Never, Lord! This shall never happen to you!'"" To which Jesus replied: ""Get behind me Satan...you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men."" And so six days later, Jesus takes Peter, James and John on a hike where His face shines like the sun, and His clothes become as white as the light. Then He is joined by none other than Moses and Elijah--who represent the Law and the Prophets--and of course, Jesus is the fulfillment of both. What happens on the mountain that day confirms that Jesus is God's Divine Son, and gives the disciples a preview of what life will look like in the Kingdom of Heaven. And Peter, who six days earlier was told that Jesus is going to be killed at the bottom of the mountain quickly gets a fantastic idea: ""Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters--one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah."" Made sense to Peter. Makes sense to me. But while Peter was still talking, ""a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, 'This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!'"" In other words, Peter, James, John and WE have to be reminded that it's Jesus' Way we must follow--not ours. ""Listen to him!"" Sounds easy right? But it's not as easy as it would seem. One reason why it's not as easy as it would seem is that listening to Jesus means following Jesus. And following Jesus means becoming like Jesus and doing the types of things Jesus does. It means being transfigured--like Jesus. And transfigured means to be changed. Jesus has just told these disciples: ""If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it."" Take up my cross? Deny myself? Lose my life? No wonder that when the disciples heard the voice from the cloud say: ""Listen to him!"" they ""fell facedown to the ground, terrified."" Author and priest Rick Morley has this to say about the disciples on the Mount of Transfiguration: ""The transfiguration isn't a small thing. It's not a fresh coat of paint. It's not even an upgraded operating system. It's metamorphosis. It's wholesale change."
Acts 1:21-22,"('Ordain', 'Apostles', 'Baptism Of John', 'Taken Up')",Baptist," JESUS THE WORD OF GOD John 1:1-18 One of the names of the Lord Jesus Christ is ""The Word."" 1. THE WORD WAS GOD'S POWER AT WORK IN CREATION (John 1:1-3). (i) In the beginning was the Word. This compares with the Creation account (Genesis 1:1-3). When God spoke the Word, all things came into existence. (ii) All things were made through Him. All things were created through Jesus and for Him (Colossians 1:16). 2. THE WORD IS THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD (John 1:4-5). (i) In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. Jesus claimed to be the Light of the World (John 9:5). John the Baptist's task was to proclaim Jesus as the Light of the World (John 1:6-9). This is the job of every preacher. (ii) The light shines in the darkness. The darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining (1 John 2:8). 3. THE WORLD REJECTS GOD'S WORD (John 1:10-11). (i) The world was made by Him, yet the world would not accept Him. It is amazing that intelligent, educated men should reject their Creator, and that they should refuse the only Saviour from man's sin. To the worldly wise, the gospel of Jesus seems foolish. They imagine that their existence is a matter of chance. Yet in refusing Jesus, the Word of God, they are refusing the fountain of all wisdom, the Wisdom of God. (ii) He came to His own home, but His own people rejected Him. Even to religious people, Jesus is a stumbling block. So they reject the very One who their various religions are seeking to find. 4. BELIEVERS ACCEPT GOD'S WORD (John 1:12-13). (i) All who trust in Him are given authority to be children of God. The gospel is preached to all: male and female, rich and poor, foolish and wise, religious and non-religious. It is the power of God for everyone who believes (Romans 1:16). Those who believe Jesus, God's Word, are given all the rights and privileges of sons in relation to God. They are heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:17). (ii) Born ...of God. How can man possibly believe the gospel? First, he must be born of God. When one of the religious leaders, Nicodemus, came to Jesus seeking the right way, Jesus said, ""You must be born again"" (John 3:3; John 3:7). As we read the Bible and pray every day, we must surrender ourselves to the work of God in our hearts, and pray that He will enter our lives through the Word of God. 5. THE MYSTERY OF THE INCARNATION (John 1:14). (i) The Word became flesh. Rather than man reaching up to God, God reaches down to man in the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ, who became flesh for us and died for all the sins of all His people. He dwelt among His own people as a real living man: born of a woman, breathing the very air He had created; knowing hunger and thirst, sadness and tiredness, pain - and death. He was better than the best of men, wiser than the wisest, full of truth. (ii) We beheld His glory. Three of the disciples, Peter, James and John, were privileged to see Jesus transformed on the mountaintop, where He was revealed in His heavenly glory and conversed with Moses and Elijah (Matthew 17:1-3). When we recognise Jesus for who He is, we also see something of His glory (2 Corinthians 4:6)."
Genesis 6:1-8,"('Hope', 'Invitation', 'Wickedness', 'Repercussion', 'Wicked')",Baptist," WICKEDNESS That INVITES REPERCUSSION-VII--Genesis 6:1-8 Attention: Joint Robbery Surveillance--WCTV Eyewitness News--January 25, 2017 TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WCTV) -- Three suspects have been arrested after leading police on a high-speed chase through Tallahassee in a stolen vehicle. According to arrest documents, on Tuesday, the Tallahassee Police Department and the Leon County Sheriff's Office were conducting a joint robbery surveillance in the west section of Tallahassee. The investigation is in response to a string of armed robberies throughout Tallahassee over the past three weeks. A TPD sergeant conducting surveillance at the Market Liquors store at 1440 Capital Circle NW observed a vehicle enter the parking lot of the liquor store, back in directly in front of the front door to the store, and sit idling with its headlights on for approximately 5 minutes. As the sergeant called for backup, the vehicle suddenly drove out of the parking lot, heading southbound on Capital Circle NW. The sergeant followed the vehicle and ran the tags, which revealed the vehicle had been reported stolen. LCSO and TPD units proceeded to pursue the vehicle through Tallahassee with lights and sirens, but the driver refused to stop. The vehicle was clocked heading eastbound on W. Tharpe Street at 102 mph. The vehicle then turned northbound on Trimble Road, heading towards Hartsfield Road. Police attempted to set up a roadblock at Hartsfield and Trimble Road but the vehicle never slowed down or attempted to avoid the patrol vehicles and TPD units were forced to move out of the way to avoid being rammed. Two LCSO units took over the pursuit and pursued the suspect vehicle eastbound on W. Tharpe St. The vehicle then drove in the opposite lane of traffic, almost striking numerous vehicles. The vehicle then turned south on Old Bainbridge Road, where multiple road crews were working nighttime construction. The vehicle continued traveling at a high rate of speed towards the workers, who had to jump out of the way to avoid being hit. An LCSO unit used a PIT maneuver to disable the vehicle, which subsequently lost its tire and crashed at the 800 block of Volusia Street. Three suspects inside the car fled on foot and refused to stop when commanded. Shortly after, all three suspects were found hiding in the woods after discarding multiple pieces of clothing that matched clothing from other robberies that TPD and LCSO are investigating. Authorities arrested Javaris Jones, 22, Tradarius Gaines,18, and Tamylon Williams, 21. All three were booked into the Leon County Jail on charges of trespassing an armed structure, grand theft of a motor vehicle, resisting an officer without violence, assault on an officer, and fleeing and eluding police with disregard for safety of people or property.

I was 'forced' to investigate."
Psalms 23:3,"('Following Jesus', 'Wandering', 'Prone To Wander')",Baptist," What do all the following men have in common? Jacob, Samson, David, Peter, Paul and Pat Damiani? Here's what they all have in common. They are all men who love God deeply, but who have wandered away from God at various points in their lives and had to be restored to fellowship with God. And I'd be really surprised if we couldn't add your name to that list as well. That's because it is the nature of sheep to wander away from the Shepherd. As Robert Robinson put it in the hymn ""Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing"" Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it, Prone to leave the God I love; This morning, as we continue our study of Psalm 23, we'll come to God's antidote for my wandering. Let's look at verse 3: He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake. (Psalm 23:3 ESV) As we've discussed before, Hebrew poetry is not characterized by rhyming words, but rather by parallelism or what we might even call ""rhyming thoughts"". We've already seen this Psalm 23 where each of the first two verses contains two lines that basically say the same thing in two different ways: The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. The reason that I don't lack anything is because the Lord is my shepherd. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. Both lines are simply different ways of saying that God provides a place where I can be at peace as I rest in the Shepherd. The same thing is true in verse 3. As we'll see this morning, we can't separate the idea of God restoring my soul from Him leading me in paths of righteousness for His name's sake. But at the same time I believe that the first line of verse 3 also serves as an important bridge that connects verses 2 and 3. I think we can see that if we look at that text in more detail. Especially in the New Testament, when the word ""soul"" is used in the Bible it usually refers to the immaterial part of man. When it is used in that way, it is helpful to think of it as consisting of our mind, will and emotions. But here in Psalm 23, the word David uses that is translated ""soul"" in English is the Hebrew word ""nephesh"" which has a much broader meaning. ""soul"" (Hebrew ""nephesh"") = ""the whole person"" The best way to understand the meaning of this word is to go back and see how it is used in the account of the creation of man in Genesis 2: then the LORD God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature. (Genesis 2:7 ESV) The word translated ""creature"" in that verse is also the Hebrew word ""nephesh"" and there it clearly refers not just to the immaterial part of man, but to his entire being - body, soul and spirit. So when David writes that God restores his soul, he is saying that God restores his entire person. We also need to examine the verb ""restores"" here. ""restore"" = ""to turn back"", ""to return"" When we looked at this verse a few weeks ago on Monday morning, one of the men likened this to restoring a classic car. I think that is a great illustration. When someone restores a car what do they do? They attempt to return the entire car - inside and out - to its original condition. David says that is what his shepherd does for his sheep - he restores them completely - inside and out."
Psalms 23:4,"('Fear', 'Valley Experience')",Baptist," This may be harder for some of us here this morning than others, but I'd like to ask all of you to think back to when you were a child. Remember what is was like when you went to bed and the lights were turned off and there you were lying in the dark? It probably didn't take much to scare you - perhaps nothing more than the sound of the wind blowing something up against your window or an unfamiliar shadow or a summer thunderstorm. In most cases, there was really nothing to fear, but you were scared nonetheless. And when that happened, where did you go with those fears? I think most of us sought comfort by calling out for our parents. And most of the time our fears would be soothed merely by their presence. Whether that meant ending up in bed with mom and dad or just knowing that they were present in the house, it was our confidence in our parents that proved to be the best antidote to our fears. As we get older, we're still not immune to fears. Some of those fears, like some of the ones we experienced as a child, are only imaginary. But many of them are quite real: "" If you're a student in school and you're struggling with your schoolwork or you're being bullied, you have a legitimate reason to be afraid. "" If your car is making a funny noise and you know you don't have enough money in your checking account to pay for the needed repairs, your fear is very reasonable. "" If you go to the doctor and he or she tells you that you have cancer, your fears are certainly justified. "" If you come into work one morning and your boss calls you aside and tells you that you've been fired or laid off, it's only natural to have some fears. And when those and other fears come into our lives, we can try to find our security in all kinds of different places. Some turn to drugs or alcohol or gambling or sex or some other kind of addictive behavior. Some try to find their security in another person, perhaps a parent or a spouse or a good friend. Some try to find their security in a weapon or a home security system or by moving out into the boonies somewhere. Once again, let me be clear this morning that sometimes we do need to enlist the help of other people and sometimes we do need to take prudent actions to protect ourselves. But ultimately none of those things can guarantee the kind of security that we're looking for to overcome our fears. But as we come to the 4th verse in Psalm 23, we find God's antidote to our fears and we discover that: True security is not found in the absence of dangers but rather in the presence of the Shepherd That is David's message to us in verse 4: Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. (Psalm 23:4 ESV) David certainly knew what it meant to walk through dark valleys in his life. It's quite likely that this Psalm was written during one of them. But as David looked back on those valleys, he recognized that the reason he had been able to walk through those valleys without fear is because his Shepherd had always been present with him."
Psalms 23:5,"('Enemies', 'Gratitude To God')",Baptist," Living as a Christian in the United States in the year 2016 is certainly not an easy thing to do. Once you identify yourself as a disciple of Jesus and you commit to live your life according to His purposes, plans, and ways, you are going to immediately face both physical and spiritual enemies in your life. There will be those who will call you hateful and bigoted. Some of your family members and former friends may either shun you or even openly attack you for your faith. You might even be sued or lose your job or suffer financial harm as a result of holding firm to your Biblical values. And when we find ourselves in the midst of those enemies, it's often difficult to know how to respond. Do I ignore them? Do I run from them? Do I hide from them? Do I retaliate? Fortunately for us we're studying a Psalm written by a man who knew firsthand what it was like to live among those who were both his personal enemies as well as enemies of his God. And this morning, we come to verse 5, where we find the Biblical answer for how to deal with our enemies: You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. (Psalm 23:5 ESV) There is a noticeable change in the Psalm that takes place in this verse. At least at first glance, it appears that David has changed metaphors here. After all, the sheep don't sit down around a table and eat a meal that the shepherd has prepared for them. And certainly the sheep don't drink from a cup. However, Phillip Keller, in his book, A Shepherd Looks at Psalm 23, suggests that David is actually continuing the shepherd and sheep metaphor here. He explains that the high mountain meadows where the shepherd take their sheep in the summer are often referred to as tablelands. Here in the southwest United states and in southern Europe, those high plateaus are known as ""mesas"" - the Spanish word for ""table"". And a number of other commentators and pastors seem to have followed his lead when dealing with this verse. On the other hand, there are a number of commentators who see an abrupt change in metaphors here in verse 5 where they see God being pictured as a gracious host. But I don't think that we have an either/or choice here. The author of the Psalm, David, had been a shepherd, but he was also a king, who was expected to be a gracious host. So as David writes these words it is not unreasonable for him to think of God as both a shepherd and a king/host. For us, I think that means that both metaphors have something to offer when it comes to our understanding of this verse. With that being said, I think that the Scriptures give us a pretty good indication of David's thinking here. David knew what it meant to sit at a table in the presence of his enemies. He often sat at the same table with King Saul, even though Saul eventually turned on David and hunted him down to try and kill him. There is a good chance that situation led David to write these words in another of his Psalms: Even my close friend in whom I trusted,"
Psalms 23:6,"('Anxiety', 'Pursuing God')",Baptist," Since we began this sermon series six weeks ago: "" A homicide bomber killed 84 people in an attack in Kabul, Afghanistan. "" 84 people were killed and over 300 others injured in Nice, France when a terrorist deliberately drove a cargo truck into a crowd. "" An 84-year-old French priest was beheaded by an ISIS knifeman. "" Here in the United States, nearly 2 dozen police officers have been killed in the line of duty. "" Both political parties in this country held tumultuous conventions and both nominated deeply flawed candidates who are both facing numerous investigations and lawsuits and who have the highest unfavorable ratings for any Presidential candidates ever. And that's just a small sampling of some major event that have happened in our world and in our country over the past six weeks. So in some ways, much has changed in our world, but on the other hand, the thing that has not changed is that if we look around at the world around us, there are many legitimate reasons for us to worry and be anxious. The other thing that has not changed is God's antidote for our worry and anxiety. Here's how we summarized that antidote when we began six weeks ago: If Jesus is my Shepherd I have everything I need This morning, as we conclude this series, we'll see that David brings Psalm 23 full circle and that he closes this beloved Psalm by saying the same thing in a slightly different way. Let's look at that last verse: Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD forever. (Psalm 23:6 ESV) Here is the main idea in David's closing verse: If I pursue the Shepherd goodness and mercy will pursue me Before we look at some practical steps we can take to make sure that we pursue the Shepherd so that goodness and mercy will pursue us, let's take a moment to define some of the terms that David uses here. Let's begin with the word ""follow"". In English, that word can have kind of a passage connotation, but the word David uses here means to pursue closely. The word is pictured perfectly by the cars on a roller coaster. If you're on a roller coaster and you're not in the first car, you sure hope that your car follows the one on front of it and doesn't get separated from it. So that is why I have chosen to use the word ""pursue"" rather than just ""follow"" when talking about both our pursuit of God and goodness and mercy pursuing us. The second word we need to define is ""goodness"". That word describes things that are good, kind, beautiful, pleasant and agreeable. It might be helpful to think of it in terms of God's blessings. The word translated ""mercy"" is often translated ""steadfast love"" in the ESV translation. It is often associated with God's forgiveness in which He withholds that which we deserve as a result of our sin. It might be helpful to think of those ideas in these terms: Goodness supplies all my needs and mercy blots out all my failures and sins. Now that is certainly the kind of life I want to experience, don't you? To not just have God's goodness and mercy available to me, but actually pursuing me. How great is that!"
"Psalms 139:13-16, Psalms 127:1-5","('Children', 'Parenting')",Baptist," I've often heard people say that children should come with an operating manual. The good news is that they do - it's called the Bible. Over the next five weeks, we're going to look at certain sections of that instruction manual. In order to make this as simple as possible and easier for us to remember, I've narrowed this down to the 5 ""D's"" of raising G-rated children that we'll be looking at over the next five weeks: "" Delight "" Devote "" Discipline "" Direct "" Disciple I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time telling you how difficult that task has become in this culture because that is obvious to all of us. But perhaps even more troubling is how the attitude toward children has changed so radically in this country over the last several generations. And that is quite troubling given that, as we'll see clearly this morning... When it comes to raising our children attitude is more important than aptitude I don't say that in any way to diminish the importance of aptitude. In fact, over the next 5 weeks, we'll spend a lot of time studying what the Bible teaches about how we are to raise our children. But the problem is that without the right attitude toward the children that God has entrusted to us, our efforts to raise G-rated kids in an X-rated world are going to fail regardless of our degree of aptitude. I think the prevailing attitude toward children in our culture is demonstrated quite clearly by this speech from Ilyse Hogue, the president of a pro-abortion group, just a couple weeks ago at the Democratic National Convention. [Clip of Ilyse Hogue speech] My heart still breaks every time I see this video - people actually cheering and celebrating the fact that this woman had an abortion. In a gathering of this size, it's certainly possible, and maybe even likely, that there are some of you here who have been a party to an abortion. If that is the case, my purpose this morning is not to make you feel any guiltier than you might already feel. I want to assure you that what you have done is no worse than any other sin that any of us in this room have committed. And I also want to assure you that God's grace, made available to us through the death and resurrection of Jesus, is more than sufficient to release you from your guilt and bondage. Hopefully you've already experienced that grace, but if not, please don't leave here today until you talk to me or to someone else about how you can do that. Let me call your attention to just few of the comments that Mrs. Hogue made in her speech: ""I made the decision that was best for me."" ""We are the same women, at differ times in our lives, each making decisions that are best for us."" ""That's what gives our families the best chance to get ahead and stay ahead."" Do you notice the common theme here? Mrs. Hogue, and unfortunately a large number of other people in our country view children like this - as an inconvenience that gets in the way of ""what's best for me"" or that keeps me from ""getting ahead and staying ahead"". And I would suggest to you this morning, that if we view our children like that, no amount of reading books or going to seminars or searching on the internet, or even trying to apply parenting principles from the Bible is going to enable us to raise G-rated kids in an X-rated world."
"Psalms 145:4-7, Titus 2:1-8","('Children', 'Parenting')",Baptist," How many of you have been watching the Olympics the last couple of weeks? I know that Mary and I have certainly watched quite a bit of the coverage. I've always loved the Summer Olympics and most of the events that are included although I'll admit that there are a few events like synchronized swimming and rhythmic gymnastics that don't really appeal to me. But probably my favorite event of all is the 4 x 100-meter relay in track and field. There is just something about the combination of the speed of the fastest runners on earth and the teamwork that is required for success that really makes that event compelling for me. Having competed in a number of relays when I ran track back in high school, I am personally aware of the importance of passing of the baton in a relay race. And over the years as I've watched the Olympics, I've seen that the winner of these relays is not always the team with the fastest runners. We certainly saw that in the men's event this last Friday. The United States finished third behind the winning team from Jamaica, which was not unexpected, but they were also beat by Japan, a team who had not placed even one of their runners in the 100-meter dash final. That is because the Japanese have practiced their baton passes for more than a year in preparation for these Olympic gains while the Americans have only practiced for a few months at most. And then to add insult to injury the Americans even lost their bronze metal when they were disqualified for passing the baton illegally. This morning we're going to be talking about a different kind of a passing of the baton, one that is frankly a lot more difficult and also much more significant than any race in the Olympics. Of course, I'm speaking of our responsibility to pass on to our children a God-centered, Bible saturated foundation for all of life. There are a lot of opinions in our culture today about who is responsible for raising our children: ? There is an increasing sentiment that the government is responsible for raising our children - a view espoused by the book ""It Takes a Village"". That title was actually hijacked from the African proverb ""It takes a whole village to raise a child"" which had nothing to do at all with the government being involved in the raising of children. The original proverb is much more consistent with what we'll learn this morning where we will see that raising children does require a village, but that village consists of extended family and the church, not the government. ? Others have pawned that responsibility off on day care centers and schools. Please don't think that I'm in any way saying that it is inherently wrong to send your kids there. After all Mary is a teacher and I have a great deal of respect for those workers and teachers who have been forced to take on a role that should not be theirs. Unless you've seen firsthand all the responsibilities that they have been burdened with because of families who have abdicated their responsibilities you can't even begin to imagine the load they bear."
"Ephesians 6:1-4, Hebrews 12:5-11","('Parenting', 'Discipline')",Baptist," I'm sure that some of you have seen this photo which has been making its way around various social media recently. [Show picture of note left by mom for her kids to clean up the kitchen]. As we're going to see this morning, not only is this an example of brilliant parenting, it also employs several of the Biblical parenting principles that we'll talk about this morning. We certainly don't know all the details here, but I think it's safe to assume that this mom works outside the home and she has some older children who come home and stay by themselves after school and the mom wants them to clean up the kitchen before they get on the internet. So just for the sake of illustration let's suppose that this mom had used a different approach here. Instead of the note she left, she left a quick handwritten note that merely read. ""Clean the kitchen"". And then about a half hour after the kids got home the mom called the house and asked ""Have you cleaned the kitchen yet?"" And her son says, ""No, not yet, but we'll get it done before you get home. Don't worry."" A half hour later the mom calls again and her son sees it's mom calling again so he tells his sister to answer the phone. Once again the mom asks, ""Have you cleaned the kitchen yet?"" And the daughter answers, ""Well we did get the dishwasher unloaded."" So the mom once again warns her daughter that it better be done before she gets home from work. Another half hour goes by and the mom calls home again. This time, seeing that it's their mom again, neither child answers the phone. So now the mom has to resort to texting a stern warning to both kids. And when she gets home a little bit later, she comes home to a dirty kitchen and ends up finishing the job herself. So let me ask you a question - Which of the two moms got the best result? [Wait for answers]. I think we would all agree that would be the first mom. But why? What are the Biblical principles that mom employed that ended up with the desired result? This morning, as we come to the third message in this series we'll answer that question. Today we're going to address the third of the ""5 D's"" of Raising G-Rated Kids in an X-Rated World"": "" Delight "" Devote "" Discipline "" Direct "" Disciple The last two weeks, the messages have focused primarily on the attitude that we need to bring to raising our children, both as individuals and as a church. We've determined that in raising our children our attitude is more important than our aptitude. We need to see our kids like God sees them - as a delight. And we also saw that our kids need devoted parents who partner with a church that is devoted to equipping and supporting those parents. While we've certainly developed some practical ideas that we need to apply in our lives in those messages, the last three messages in this series are going to be even more practical, especially for those of you who are still raising young children. We're going to begin today with a passage from Paul's letter to the church in Ephesus. So go ahead and turn first to Ephesians, chapter 6:"
"Ephesians 6:1-4, Deuteronomy 6:1-9","('Parenting', 'Spanking')",Baptist," [Playground study video] Some of you may be wondering what fences on playgrounds have to do with raising G-Rated Kids in an X-Rated World. But as we'll see this morning, in spite of the fact that it is counterintuitive to our own natural thinking, establishing fences, or boundaries, in the lives of our children actually gives them the freedom to become the godly men and women that God wants them to become. But as we saw last week, when we talked about four different parenting styles, we need to establish those appropriate boundaries in a way that does not provoke our children to anger. And that is not always an easy thing to do, is it? In this morning's message, we will primarily focus on the fourth of the 5 ""D's"" of Raising G-Rated Kids in an X-Rated World: "" Delight "" Devote "" Discipline "" Direct "" Disciple But before we do that I want to spend a few minutes following up on one aspect of discipline that I didn't get a chance to address last week. Once again we're going to begin in Ephesians 6 this morning: Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. ""Honor your father and mother"" (this is the first commandment with a promise), ""that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land."" Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. (Ephesians 6:1-4 ESV) Hopefully, you'll remember the overall principle that we drew from this passage last week: Raising G-Rated kids requires discipline that shapes the will without breaking the spirit We began our discussion last week with the negative command found in the first part of verse 4: Fathers [and mothers], do not provoke your children to anger... We discussed four different parenting styles and determined that the authoritative style where parents set clear standards for their children, monitor the limits they set, and let children develop autonomy is the most effective way to make sure we don't break the spirit of our children. We then went on to discuss the positive command in the second part of that verse: ...but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. We determined that while the ideas of discipline and instruction were certainly similar they are distinct enough that we are dealing with them separately. Last week we focused on discipline and we saw that the Greek word for discipline that Paul uses is a broad term that describes everything parents do to train, correct, cultivate and educate children in order to help them to develop and mature. And we looked at Hebrews 12, which describes how God disciplines His children do get some further insight into that process. We saw there that in disciplining our children that we need to employ both punitive and non-punitive measures. One of the punitive measures that we didn't get a chance to discuss is clearly spelled out for us in numerous Bible passages, primarily in the book of Proverbs. Let's quickly look at a few of them. Whoever spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is diligent to discipline him."
Proverbs 22:6,"('Parenting', 'Disciple Children')",Baptist," As we've discussed for the last four weeks, raising G-Rated Kids in an X-Rated World is not easy. And perhaps, even in the church, we've made it even more difficult because of the expectations that we place on parents. Often, it seems like what I call the ""Christian parenting industry"" feeds these fears by promoting the idea that if we don't do everything just right as a parent, we'll ruin our kids forever. So all these so called ""Christian parenting experts"" write books and hold conferences that promise to provide parents with a method or program that will ensure that their kids will turn out OK. But while some of the advice they offer can often be helpful, what I find is that in general these ""experts"" make parenting much more complicated than it needs to be on one hand and much more superficial than it should be on the other hand. If you doubt that, then just Google ""Christian potty training"" and click on a few of the nearly 500,000 items that come up. Really? I guess I missed all those places in the Bible that give us detailed instructions about how to potty train our kids. So we needlessly make parents feel guilty because they didn't use just the right method to teach their children how to use a toilet. But even worse, we put so much emphasis on doing that just right that we miss out on the much more important aspects of raising our kids that we actually do find in the Bible. This morning, we're going to take a look at a verse that has probably caused more parents to needlessly feel guilty about their parenting than any other verse in the Bible. But what I will attempt to do this morning is to show all of us that a proper understanding of that verse not only frees us up from that needless guilt, but that it also reveals to us the most important thing we can do for our kids. But before I do that, I want to ask you all to write down your answer to the question that I have posed in your sermon outline"" What is a child's greatest need? Just write down the first thing that comes to mind. Don't try to give the answer you think I'm looking for or the ""spiritual"" answer. [Wait for people to answer] Would anyone like to share what you wrote down? [Let them share answers]. I agree that all those are important. Our kids need security, a sense of self-worth, good behavior [and the other things people mention]. But this morning, we're going to see what the Bible says about the one thing that they need above all else. And the way that we make sure that we meet that need is by employing the fifth of the 5 D's of Raising G-Rated Kids: "" Delight "" Devote "" Discipline "" Direct "" Disciple In preparing this week's message, I began to wonder if perhaps this shouldn't have been the first message in the series because we're going to focus on our end goal that we are to pursue when it comes to raising our children. But as I thought about it some more, I've come to the conclusion that it is appropriate to end the series with this message because it will hopefully leave us with a good reminder of what we're trying to accomplish when we apply everything else we've learned over the last five weeks."

When Chris Spielman played for the Buffalo Bills, he was everything a middle linebacker should be: tough, strong and smart, with passion, total commitment, and loyalty to the game. He played the entire 1995 season with a torn pectoral muscle that he sustained in the season opener. But the game took a distant second place in his thinking during the 1998 season. He chose to stay home. He cooked, took care of his kids, and cared for his wife--by choice. Stephanie, Chris' wife, was struggling through the stark reality of breast cancer. Surgery, chemotherapy, and nausea were Stephanie's opponents. During her fight, Chris was at her side. His actions supported his ""family before job"" credo. Asked by a reporter from the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle if he'd consider a return to the Bills late in the season, Spielman said, ""I'd play in a heartbeat, but what kind of man would I be if I backed out on my word to her? I wouldn't be a man at all. ""Football fans saw Spielman as a man because of his aggressive, leave-it-all-on-the-field style of play. But what really makes him a man? It's his personal sacrifice and unending commitment and loyalty to his wife."
Romans 6:1-11,"('Sin', 'United With Christ')",Baptist," When Mary and I were dating, I often used to leave here house quite late on Friday night or early on Saturday morning. On one of those occasions I was driving down Orange Grove Road in my bright yellow Ford Pinto when I was pulled over by a Pima County Sherriff's officer. When he asked me if I knew how fast I had been going, I said. ""No sir."" So he took me back to his car and showed me the readout on his radar gun that showed that I had been going 10 miles per hour over the speed limit. I didn't say anything to the officer, but inside I was actually quite proud that my Pinto had actually been able to get up to that rate of speed so quickly after stopping for the red light at the last intersection. After asking me some questions about where I was going and running my license and registration, the officer said, ""As a student, you probably can't afford a ticket can you?"" ""No sir"", I replied. He told me that he was going to let me off with a warning, but that if he ever caught me speeding again, he wouldn't be so nice. So having experienced grace from that officer, I can assure you that every time I drove that same stretch of road after that I was very careful to drive under the speed limit and not presume that I would receive grace the next time. But for some reason, when it comes to our relationship with God, there are a lot of Christians who have taken the position that since God extends His grace to me when I sin, I ought to keep on sinning so that I can get more of God's grace my life. On more than one occasion I have witnessed those who claim to be disciples of Jesus intentionally choose to do something they know to be sin and comment that it's OK because they know that God will forgive them. But does God really want us to presume on His grace like that? That's the question we'll attempt to answer this morning from Romans chapter 6. So go ahead and open your Bibles to that chapter. You're going to want to keep your Bibles handy because I'm going to be referring back to our passage frequently this morning But before I read this morning's test, let's take a moment to review what we've learned so far in the Book of Romans. "" The first three chapters of Paul's letter teach us that we are all sinners whose sin has separated us from God. "" In chapters 4 and 5 Paul explains the idea of justification which deals with how Jesus takes away the penalty of sin. In those chapters we learned that there is nothing we can do to take care of that penalty through our own efforts and that the only way to do that is to have God credit us with the righteousness of Jesus by placing our trust completely in His life, death and resurrection. "" Now, for three chapters, beginning in chapter 6, Paul is going to address the concept of sanctification which deals with how Jesus overcomes the power of sin in our lives and the process by which God produces actual righteousness in our lives as we become more like Jesus. Before I read this morning's passage, look back with me to chapter 5, verse 20, which sets the stage for what Paul writes in chapter 6."
Romans 6:11-14,"('Sin', 'Hate Sin')",Baptist," On May 28 of this year four-year-old Isaiah Dickerson climbed under a fence and fell 12 feet down into the gorilla enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo. In order to protect the boy zoo officials had to shoot Harambe, the 17-year-old gorilla, sparking a public outrage among many people. Sin is a lot like a wild animal at a zoo. Although those wild animals are dangerous and can do us much harm, as long as we stay behind the barriers that have been put up for our safety, those animals can roar and growl all they want, but they can't harm us. It's not until we go around or under or over those barriers and get into the cage that we are in danger. As we saw last week, because we are united, or growing together, with Jesus in His death, burial and resurrection, we have been freed from the power of sin. Therefore, sin cannot harm us or dominate our lives unless we choose to intentionally ignore and go around the barriers that come with being united with Jesus. But even though Jesus has given us every tool we need to live a life that is not subject to the power of sin, that doesn't mean that living like that is an easy thing to do. So in Romans 6, Paul gives his readers, and us, some very practical guidance about how we can live lives that are free from slavery to sin because we are ""in Jesus"". Hopefully you'll remember that last week, we looked at the first 10 verses of that chapter and found that the key word there was ""know"". Paul focused on the idea that because Jesus died and rose from the dead and we are united with Him that we, too, died to sin and have been freed from its power. So the focus there was primarily on our mind. And therefore one of the applications we made was to stress the importance of coming back frequently to this section of the Bible so that we'll keep those facts at the front of our mind. Today, we'll pick up in verse 11 and see how Paul goes on to encourage us to engage our hearts and our wills in addition to our minds. Once again this morning, you'll need to keep your Bibles open since I'll be referring back to our passage throughout the message today. We could illustrate the flow of this section like this based on the key verbs in each section: know (mind) (verses 1-10) consider (heart) (verse 11) present (will) (verses 12-14) Last week, I really wrestled with whether to include verse 11 with last week's message or to wait until this week to take a look at it. But the more I studied and meditated on this passage, it seems to me that verse 11 is one of those transitional verses that really ties together what precedes it with what follows. We can't move from just knowing these facts to engaging our wills without first taking these truths to heart. So let's begin this morning by reading that key verse - verse 11: So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus. A number of commentators point out that this is the first command in the entire book of Romans. While I didn't have time to go back and look at every single verb up to this point, a quick review leads me to believe that is indeed the case. And if it is, that means that Paul has spent five and a half chapters giving us all the information that we need to be able to obey that command. Again, what I love about Paul is that he rarely gives us commands or instructions without giving detailed information about why we should obey them."
Romans 6:15-19,"('Sin', 'Slavery To Sin')",Baptist," This week I read about a teenager who was explaining to his father why he should be allowed to go see a movie at the theater. That particular movie had all of his favorite actors and it was ""only"" rated PG-13 because it merely suggested sex, but never really showed it. And the language wasn't too bad - they only used the Lord's name in vain three times. And there was only the usual violence - you know the kind where a building with a bunch of people in it gets blown up and a few people are killed with guns. A little later that evening, the father asked his son if he would like some of the special brownies he had prepared. He explained that he had taken the favorite family recipe and added one new ingredient. When his son asked what that new ingredient was his father calmly responded ""dog poop"". He went on to explain that there was only a little bit of dog poop in the brownies, but that all of the other ingredients were the same quality ingredients he always used. Not surprisingly the son wanted nothing to do with those brownies and I think he got the message. So every time thereafter that his son asked to do something that he shouldn't, the father merely asked him if he would like a special brownie. For the last two weeks, we've explored the first 14 verses of Romans 6, where Paul answered the question ""Since God is a God of grace, why don't I just live a lifestyle of sin so that I can experience more of that grace?"" Paul answered that question by pointing out that when we place our faith in Jesus, we are so closely united with Him that we die to sin in the same way Jesus did. So therefore, we have been freed from the power of sin and we have the ability to keep sin from reigning in our lives like that. While that is absolutely a crucial passage of Scripture for us to understand and take to heart, I really doubt that most genuine Christians really take the position that one can be a disciple of Jesus and still live a lifestyle in which sin is allowed to reign consistently. But the question that Paul poses in verse 15 is another matter altogether. It is much more likely we will conclude, like the teenager who wanted to go to that movie, that it might be possible to sin just a little bit and still be a ""good Christian"". But as we'll see this morning, Paul answers that question just as emphatically as he answered the question in verse 1. So once again, take your Bibles and turn to Romans 6 and make sure you keep them handy and we study the next section of Paul's letter. I'll begin in verse 15: What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? Normally I don't try to bore you with a Greek grammar lesson any more than is absolutely necessary, but the verb tenses here in Romans 6 are so crucial to our understanding of what Paul is writing that I do need to call your attention to them. In particular, I want to compare the question Paul asks here in verse 15 to the one back in verse 1: What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?"
Romans 6:20-23,"('Sin', 'Freedom From Sin')",Baptist," Americans spend over $60 billion each year trying to lose weight. The National Institutes of Health estimates that includes $25 billion dollars spent on weight loss supplements. Most of the companies that pitch those products promote the idea that you can just take a pill and watch the pounds melt away. The products make grandiose claims like 97% ""success rates"", or ""clinically proven results"" and even offer 90-day money back guarantees. But the fact is that a pill that allows you to eat whatever you want and lose weight is nothing more than a pipe dream. If anyone ever actually developed a pill that could do that all the other companies would go out of business overnight. So it's really no surprise that for the last 10 years the Federal Trade Commission has brought more than 80 law enforcement actions against companies for making false or deceptive weight loss claims for the products they are selling. By now you're probably wondering what weight loss supplements have to do with Romans chapter 6. I would suggest to you that as Paul wraps up this chapter, the point he is going to make is that sin is a lot like those weight loss products because, just like those products... Sin never delivers what it promises I think all of us have enough experience with sin in our lives that we know that to be true. But the real question we must answer this morning is how knowing that truth makes a difference in the way we live our lives. So once again this morning, we'll let Paul answer that question for us. This will be our 4th week in Romans chapter 6, and while it might seem that is a bit of overkill, I am completely convinced that it has been time well spent since this is such a crucial passage when it comes to our development as mature disciples of Jesus. Hopefully you'll remember that this chapter began with a question: If God's grace abounds where sin increases, shouldn't I just live a lifestyle of sin so that I can experience more of God's grace? Paul answered that question with a resounding ""No!"". He went on to explain that when we place our faith in Jesus we are so closely united with Him in His death and resurrection that we have died to sin and been transformed into completely new creatures who have been freed from the power of sin. Therefore, we can no longer live as slaves to sin. That gave rise to a second question which essentially asked: I understand that I can't be a genuine disciple of Jesus and live a lifestyle of sin, but is it OK if I just dabble in a little sin once in a while? Again Paul answered with an emphatic ""No!"". He went on to explain that when we sin, we put ourselves back into slavery to sin again and since we become like the master we have chosen to serve we fall into more and more sin as a result. This morning, as Paul concludes chapter 6, he is going to show us the end result of the person who chooses to return to serving sin once they have been freed from that master. So go ahead and turn in your Bibles to Romans 6 and follow along as I read beginning in verse 20."
"John 4:5-42, Exodus 17:3-7","('Evangelism', 'Samaritan Woman', 'Evaluating People')",Catholic," Lent 3 Relationships that came to a crisis but got resolved by God are featured in our Readings this Sunday. e.g. A father wanted to read a magazine but was being bothered by his little girl. She wanted to know what the United States looked like. Finally, he tore a sheet out of his new magazine on which was printed the map of the country. Tearing it into small pieces, he gave it to her and said, ""Go into the other room and see if you can put this together. This will show you our whole country today."" After a few minutes she returned and handed him the map, correctly fitted and taped together. The father was surprised and asked how she had finished so quickly. ""Oh,"" she said, ""on the other side of the paper is a picture of Jesus. When I got all of Jesus back where He belonged, then our country just came together."" It works the same way for relationships. In our First Reading, the Israelites and Moses are in a crisis in the desert. Why did you ever make us leave Egypt? Was it just to have us die here of thirst... They had a lack of gratitude. And, it sounds as if even Moses doesn't know what to do next to get them the water they need. But, God tells him to, ""Strike the rock, and the water will flow from it for the people to drink."" This Moses did, in the presence of the elders of Israel, and water was given. 2). There is also a crisis in relationships in our Gospel Reading under the theme of: LOOKING FOR LOVE IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES. e.g. An ad in the local newspaper read: ""For sale, sleeveless wedding gown, white, size 8, veil included. Worn once, by mistake."" That's what most addiction is at its core - trying to fill the aching emptiness with something that will take away the pain - suicide, promiscuity and greed. St. Augustine was essentially right when he noted that within every heart there is God shaped hole. Most of the women in the vicinity would have been at the well early in the morning to get the water they needed for the day. Perhaps the woman in today's gospel came to draw water at noon in order to avoid nasty looks or comments from the other woman about her past five husbands and her current situation living with a man. This women tried the first husband, drinking of that ""water"" and she was not satisfied. Then the second, third, fourth, and fifth husbands. Since none of these satisfied her, she was trying another one. (one that was not hers) Her changing of husbands fully proved that however much she drank of that ""water"" she was still thirsty. The Lord said, ""everyone that drinks of this well will thirst again"" Jesus states that the water from the well will leave one thirsty again, representing the received religion tradition there in Samaria. In the Jewish tradition, the Torah was liken to living water. Here, it is a metaphor for the Holy Spirit. Jesus promises that this water will become a font over-flowing within her. This means that she will be over-flowing with God's grace and life. LOOKING FOR LOVE IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES She had 5 men, now living with a six. Number 7 is God. She desires the peace and the happiness that the things of this world cannot provide."
"Luke 2:8-20, Matthew 27:27-54, John 20:1-21","('Easter', 'Reality')",Baptist," Introduction My Sister-In-Law gave me a set of books called the Mitford Series (10 books) Written by Jan Karon Jan Karon lives in Banner Elk and Mitford sounds a lot like Banner Elk. Tim Kavanaugh - brought up Baptist but now an Episcopal Priest (very biblical). The Turkey Club meets at the Main Street Grill - Father Tim, JC, and Coot Lew's Esso, The Rectory and Lord's Chapel, Porter Place, Fernbank, Homeless Hobbs, Meadowgate Farm, Dooley and his 5 siblings, Buck, Miss Sadie, Louella, Cynthia, Edith, and many more people and places. I read the books every fall - it's just like being home!! I know Mitford like I know my own neighborhood. The people, the places, the roads, the character of the people, I'm THERE!! Even though I've read the books several times, I still sense something even before I know it's about to happen! I feel the tension building up, the excitement, the emotions, the reality is REAL. The story is known -well known. But IF I put myself THERE, in the scene, it feels so much more real. 1. Shepherds Seeing Angels! Luke 2:8-20 Shepherds overseeing their sheep. Imagine yourself as being one of the shepherds that night. Several flocks have come together for the night. Guarding against predators, checking health of the sheep, catching a nap, etc. Then, BAM, the angel of the Lord suddenly appears. Suddenly there is a bright light A mighty being in the midst of that very bright light Speaking to them in a tremendously loud voice Then, BAM again, a huge host of the awesome, powerful beings, praising God. And, POOF, they are gone! A trip to Bethlehem to see this baby, this king, this Messiah. The excitement of telling everyone about the night's happenings. 2. God Dying on a Roman Cross!! Matthew 27:27-54 Let's be one of the Roman Soldiers of that day in Jerusalem. Pilate has interrogated Jesus but due to the crowd, has ordered Jesus' death by crucifixion. As a soldier, we take Jesus into the courtyard, strip him down, tie him to a post in the courtyard. Put a crown made of thorns on his head - viciously. Put a reed in his hand (as if he were a king with authority) Put a scarlet robe on him, bowed down before him and mocked him. Then let's spit on him, take the reed and beat him on the head with it. Take a cat-of-9-tails and beat his body (organs and bones showing) Put a cross on his back and make him carry it to the place of execution (Calvary). After nailing him to the cross and lifting it upright, Let's gamble for his few belongings. If he is thirsty, let's give him vinegar (not water) mixed with gall (a drug) Let everyone passing by and his Pharisee accusers mock him. About noon-time, the sky grows black and dark (not an eclipse). It lasts until 3pm - three full hours. And Jesus, God's only begotten Son, very God Himself, gives up the ghost. Friends and followers take the body and bury Jesus nearby. 3. The Messiah is ALIVE!!! John 20:1-21 Now let's be one of the 11 Disciples, or perhaps one of the women. Jesus has been dead for 3 days. We are afraid because if they hated Jesus enough to have him killed,"
"Matthew 4:1-11, Genesis 2:7-9","('Desert', 'Temptation', 'Temper')",Catholic," Lent1A Robert Louis Stevenson once wrote an unforgettable story about a Dr. Jekyll and a Mr. Hyde. Most of you know the story well. Dr. Henry Jekyll was respected in his community-a gentleman in every respect. But he had some secret vices which he kept carefully hidden from public view. Desiring to practice these vices unrestrained without endangering his standing in the community, he concocted a strange potion that would allow him to transform his physical features at will. Thus he would be free to move about town and practice his vices without damaging his reputation. During the day, he was the amiable Dr. Jekyll, a credit to his community. At night he was transformed into a sociopathic monster called Mr. Hyde caring for no one at all and wreaking havoc everywhere he went. Initially, Dr. Jekyll was able to control these transformations, but such unrestrained evil could not be kept in check for long. One night in his sleep, without any intent on his part, he was transformed into the infamous Mr. Hyde. Even worse, the evil monster within began dominating his life and eventually took over completely. Dr. Jekyll disappeared completely, only Mr. Hyde was left. Stevenson's point was that there is a battle going within each of us. Each of us carries around within us a little of Mr. Hyde and if we do not pay constant attention to our character, we too, can be dominated by our lesser selves. As Lent begins, we hear about the devils of desert--the situations and people who challenge--these strange companions can test whether or not we know the ultimate truth about our life. Only in the shadows of the wilderness, with the wind howling it will become clear: we live from God, we live on God, we live for God. Could it be that our deserts are the very places from where we draw our spiritual power like water from a well, where our faith is strengthened, and assurance given that we can as Jesus did, deliberately choose the good in the face of temptation and conflict? What happened to Adam and Eve? Typical of Satan's temptations, it was subtle for he made it seem as if the choice to sin is actually a choice to do the better thing. Eve looks at the forbidden tree and it appealed to her physical senses, ""pleasing to the eyes"" and a positive enhancement of life, ""desirable for gaining wisdom."" The serpent neatly reverses what God had previously said. God's words had emphasized freedom--they could eat from every tree of the garden with only one prohibited. The serpent makes the prohibition universal, making God seem more interested in restriction than freedom. Eve must have thought that piece of fruit was going to taste pretty good. But as she and Adam learned, God had a reason for making off limits. They may have enjoyed the taste for a moment, but the guilt and regret lasted a whole lot longer. Temptations are really about identity; Satan tempted Jesus saying, ""If you are the son of God.' Each temptation cuts to the core of what it means to faithfully centered on God. 1 Corinthians 10:13 God will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it. Deuteronomy 4:2 and Proverbs 30:6 speaking of neither adding to nor subtracting from God's word."
Matthew 17:1-0,"('Transfiguration', 'Trasformation')",Catholic," Second Sunday of Lent Jesus' transfiguration and the believer's transformation Flannery O'Connor asks a probing question, ""Have you ever looked inside yourself and seen what you are not?"" What we are not, but should be, is the question. It's the sometimes frustrating denying or neglecting who God is calling us to be but some sin or issue keeps holding us back. Romans 3:23, sin is falling short of the glory of God. The transfiguration of Jesus speak of our transfiguring of pain, of knowledge, and of the world. The motif of celestial journey. In a general way, one may say that the ascent of Jesus and the disciples to high mountain has as its goal an encounter with the divine. Through prayer. Three tents: the disciples wish the state of happiness they are experiencing due to the glorious vision to continue. But the vision is transient. Peter cannot continue making his proposal because he is effectively interrupted by a cosmic phenomenon, a bright cloud and one voice speaking about Jesus. The vision led to hearing, and they see only Jesus. The voice says, ""Listen to him."" Our Open Prayer says, ""O God, who have commanded us to listen to your beloved Son."" e.g. Al-anon says that ""One of our slogans is a single word: THINK. How can I do that if all I do is talk? I can benefit from the Steps and the slogans only if I think about them. I can learn from others only if learn to keep silent and think about what I am hearing. The compulsive talkers among us are those who get the least help from the program and make the least progress."" The disciples hear that the one who had announced a bitter defeats is not vanquished by rather receives the highest honors of heaven. After death we too will be metamorphosed from being the caterpillars of our earthly existence into being the butterflies of our heavenly existence. e.g. When Bishop Warren Chandler of the Episcopal Church was dying he was talking to an old friend who sat with him at his bedside and his friend asked, ""Do you have any fears of crossing over the river of death?"" The old bishop smiled and said with conviction, ""My Father owns the land on both sides of the river. Why should I be afraid to cross? 2). The fruit of prayer is action and mission. Pope Benedict XVI said that ""when one has the grace to sense a strong experience of God, it is as though seeing something similar to what the disciples experienced during the Transfiguration. For a moment they experienced ahead of time something that will constitute the happiness of paradise. In general, it is brief experiences that God grants on occasions, especially"" to endure hardships. Our Second Reading today says, ""Bear you share of the hardship of the gospel with the strength that comes from God."" Notice the theme of empowerment. Even the highest moments of mystical union are meant to empower one to do God's work (which is why Peter did not know what he was saying about building three tents). The point of prayer is not to stay on the mountain. It's about service. e.g. There is the story of a lady who went to a prayer group where everyone was sitting in silence. ""When does the service begin?"" she asked a man sitting near her. His answer: ""As soon as the meeting is over."""
2 Thessalonians 2:1-3,"('Babylon', 'Unbelief', 'Apostacy', 'Whore Of Revelation')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Fake Church - Blind Leaders of The Blind By now we have all heard the new phrase ""Fake News"" which describes dishonest reporting and misleading narratives within the news media. Some believe this is a major issue facing our country, others believe it is itself fake. No matter what your view is I believe there is another deceptive movement in our day, a movement I have dubbed ""Fake Church""! While the term may be new this issue is very very old. In the pages of the New Testament we read about the enemies of Christ, more specifically the Scribes and Pharisees. They not only spread false rumors about Jesus (saying He broke the Sabbath & performed miracles by the power of Satan) they put out their own fake news by saying that His resurrection was a hoax and that the disciples stole the body. Ironically it was the Religious leaders of Jesus' day who were the main threat, not the agnostics, not the sinners, not even the Romans! Jesus said about the Scribes and Pharisees in Matthew 15 ""they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch."" When Jesus exposed the false teachings of the Religious leaders they not only ridiculed him, they plotted his demise! Later, in the book of Acts when the Apostles preached against them, the Jewish clergy dismissed them as uneducated men who needed to be dealt with harshly. When you read the New Testament the large ""church"" in power was the ""fake church"". The true church was and is those people who believe the gospel, that salvation comes by grace through faith in the death, burial and resurrection of Christ (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). I submit to all who read this that things have not changed. The ""fake church"" is still the majority and they still hold the power and influence over society. As a Pastor I am not against unbelievers, I want to see them come to faith, just as Jesus did! I am not against sinners, after all Jesus died for sinners! Besides that, we have all sinned and have fallen short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). My concern is towards the blind leaders of the blind, the ""Fake Church"" that leads people awa y from the truth! The ""Fake Church"" is literally everywhere! They have exchanged the true Gospel for a ""Fake Gospel"" that denies the historic teachings of the faith. For 1800 years of church history Christians believed that God created the heavens and the earth, today the ""Fake Church"" believes that the ""Big Bang"" created everything from nothing! The Bible teaches that Adam was created in Gods image, the ""Fake Church"" teaches that Adam didn't even exist and that man evolved from the slime! The Real Church believes that Jesus is the only name under heaven given among men, by which we must be saved (Acts 4:12). The ""Fake Church"" isn't even sure there is a heaven, but if there is any religion can get you there."
Deuteronomy 30:15-20,"('Communion', 'Diversity', 'Lent', 'Spirit Unity')",Catholic," Thursday after Ash Wednesday 2017 Joy of the Gospel On this first full day of Lent after Ash Wednesday, the Lord sets before us a clear choice: Shall we choose life and goodness, or death and evil. There are no nuances here, no shades of gray. We either opt and live for God's will, or we are His enemy, and in His enemy's employ and slavery. It is no coincidence that the fourth commandment promises that if we honor our parents, we will have long life in the land. For they on earth take the place of our heavenly Father, and obedience to Him means we can have eternal life in His presence. In the Gospel, Our Lord spells out that obedience more starkly. Like the Son of God, we children of God will have to deny everything except our covenant with the Father, and one way or another suffer the pains of little crosses in imitation of the One who took up the Big Cross and died for our salvation. It's a battle, a war, and we are on the winning side. But we can't expect to end our battle without injury. The Holy Father has been laying down principles for building a just society under God's order, and he comes to the second principle: 'Conflict cannot be ignored or concealed. It has to be faced. But if we remain trapped in conflict, we lose our perspective, our horizons shrink and reality itself begins to fall apart. In the midst of conflict, we lose our sense of the profound unity of reality. 'When conflict arises, some people simply look at it and go their way as if nothing happened; they wash their hands of it and get on with their lives. Others embrace it in such a way that they become its prisoners; they lose their bearings, project onto institutions their own confusion and dissatisfaction and thus make unity impossible. But there is also a third way, and it is the best way to deal with conflict. It is the willingness to face conflict head on, to resolve it and to make it a link in the chain of a new process. ""Blessed are the peacemakers!"" (Mt 5:9). 'In this way it becomes possible to build communion amid disagreement, but this can only be achieved by those great persons who are willing to go beyond the surface of the conflict and to see others in their deepest dignity. This requires acknowledging a principle indispensable to the building of friendship in society: namely, that unity is greater than conflict. Solidarity, in its deepest and most challenging sense, thus becomes a way of making history in a life setting where conflicts, tensions and oppositions can achieve a diversified and life-giving unity. This is not to opt for a kind of syncretism, or for the absorption of one into the other, but rather for a resolution which takes place on a higher plane and preserves what is valid and useful on both sides. 'This principle, drawn from the Gospel, reminds us that Christ has made all things one in himself: heaven and earth, God and man, time and eternity, flesh and spirit, person and society. The sign of this unity and reconciliation of all things in him is peace. Christ ""is our peace"" (Eph 2:14). The Gospel message always begins with a greeting of peace, and peace at all times crowns and confirms the relations between the disciples. Peace is possible because the Lord has overcome the world and its constant conflict ""by making peace through the blood of his cross"" (Col 1:20). But if we look more closely at these biblical texts, we find that the locus of this reconciliation of differences is within ourselves, in our own lives, ever threatened as they are by fragmentation and breakdown. If hearts are shattered in thousands of pieces, it is not easy to create authentic peace in society."
"Habakkuk 2:4, Romans 1:16-17, Galatians 3:11-12, Hebrews 10:38-39","('Faith', 'Grace', 'Baptism', 'Salvation', 'Discipleship', 'Obedience', 'Faithfulness', 'Justification', 'Righteousness', 'Eternal Life', 'Live', 'Saved', 'Dispensation', 'Just', 'Law Of Moses', 'Gospel Of Christ', 'Fulfill The Law', 'End Of Law')",Christian/Church Of Christ," INTRODUCTION Outline. 1. The Letter to the Romans 2. The Letter to the Galatians 3. The Letter to the Hebrews Remarks. 1. In our lesson today we are going to discuss the theme: ""The Just Shall Live by Faith."" This lesson will emphasize that the just shall be declared righteous by their faith in Jesus Christ. This original quotation comes from the book of Habakkuk, notice: ""Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith,"" Habakkuk 2:4. Jehovah was providing the prophet an answer to his question regarding Judah's exile by the Babylonians. The Chaldeans were lifted up with pride and haughtiness in the capture and treatment of the people of God. Jehovah promises that: ""the soul which is lifted up is not upright in Him; but the just shall live by his faith."" This promise not only provided hope to Habakkuk regarding the people's exile; but it also had a prophetic meaning regarding, ""justification by faith in Jesus Christ."" 2. First, we will consider Paul's Letter to the Romans and the phrase, ""the just shall live by faith."" The emphasis in this verse was on the means of the believer's salvation - which was ""by faith,"" Romans 1:16-17. Paul quotes the passage from the prophet, with the emphasis on faith: ""The just shall live by faith."" As with the Prophet's statement: ""no soul which is lifted up (with pride) is upright in Him."" We are reminded it's, ""Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy he saved us,"" Titus 3:5. 3. Second, we will discuss Paul's Letter to the Galatians and the phrase, ""the just shall live by faith,"" Galatians 3:11. The emphasis of this verse is on the word ""just."" How does one become just in the sight of God? The process is through ""faith in Christ."" Recall the apostle Paul: ""Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God... By whom also we have access by faith into this grace ...and rejoice in hope of the glory of God,"" Romans 5:1-2. 4. Lastly, we will investigate Paul's Letter to the Hebrews and the phrase: ""The just shall live by faith."" The emphasis of this verse is on the word ""live."" In our text of discussion: ""The just is said to live by faith."" It further states: ""But if any man draws back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul,"" Hebrews 10:38-39. Paul affirms the just shall live by faith; and sustained by faith to the ""saving of the soul,"" if he waits on the Lord. With this introduction let's consider our first thought: ""The Just Shall Live by Faith."" BODY OF LESSON I THE LETTER TO THE ROMANS A. In Paul's Letter to the Romans. He entertains Habakkuk's statement: ""Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith,"" Habakkuk 2:4. Solomon said: ""Pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall,"" Proverbs 16:18. Also, ""A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit,"" Proverbs 29:23; James 4:10; 1 Peter 5:5-6."
"Genesis 3:17-19, Psalms 90:10","('Death', 'Life', 'Work', 'Sweat')",Assembly Of God," Gen 3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; 19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. Psalms 90:10 The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away. Ever since the Fall, we have been trying to overcome the death sentence that was given. We will fail at that and I think most people realize it so the alternative is to try and delay it as long as possible. At one point, long life was really long with 969 years being the greatest age ever achieved. Then God lowered the possibility to 120 years or as some think there were 120 years before the flood and then ages started decreasing. (Genesis 6:3) Jacob lived to be 130, but 120 may have been an average just as we see in Psalms 90. Even in David's time, the average was 70 though by reason of strength you might make it to 80. Obviously, not everyone made it to 70 because of war, disease, murder and such. Some lived longer, but in the end, the average was 70-80. Medical science was not very advanced until many centuries after David and even then many died of various epidemics and numerous wars. The 2oth Century saw marvelous achievements in medical science. We have a vast array of labor-saving devices to the point of we once were paid to exercise by working to be paid and now most of us work to pay for our exercise at the club. In fact, the mental stress we put on ourselves and the massive debt we accrue puts us in constant fear of losing it all and killing us by MIs caused by that fear. We were meant to earn our bread by the sweat of our brow, not the furrow of the brow causing us to enter the furrow we call a grave at much earlier ages than 70. So with all the advancement of medical science and science in general have we extended the average age of man? Not really, if you look at the stats in the link below. The world average is actually barely over 67. True some countries squeak a tad past 80, but so many are far less that the world average for men is 65 and women 69.5. Before ladies started entering the workforce and developing the bad habits of men they used to average living 7 years longer than men and now 4.5. I suspect as we go on that may shrink some more. Ironically, the US with its medical marvels is 38 on the list, but we are right in the 70-80 range. Guess we are not getting the bang for the buck we wished we would have gotten. So, while we have some centenarians and centenarian-plus folks around the globe, we are still stuck on a 70-80 cycle. Someday, with much surgery and replacement parts, we may get a VIP to live to 150 or so, but that rarity will still not get us over the hump."
"Galatians 5:1-6, Colossians 2:9-17","('Grace', 'Law', 'Gentile', 'Jew')",Assembly Of God," Gal 5:1 Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. 2 Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. 3 For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. 4 Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace. 5 For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. 6 For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. Many of the Jewish believers struggled with the transition from Law to Grace and tried to merge the two in an attempt to reconcile their questions and doubts. Many Gentiles also have had this problem and we see this admixture in many true sects of Christianity as well as various cults. This passage alone should put the debate to bed even tough many Messianic believers would disagree. Circumcision was the very first step into entering the covenant and indeed the very first expression of the Law though it proceeded Moses. It was Abraham that God first gave this instruction and then it was codified by Moses. A child born into a Hebrew home and circumcised would then be taught to follow the Law. It was the job of the Father to do this or to hire a tutor. Timothy being the child of a Greek father and a Jewish mother was taught only because his mother and grandmother had him tutored since his father would not have fulfilled his responsibility. The Jerusalem Council in the Book of Acts clearly stated that the Gentiles were not required to keep the Law of Moses. They were only given certain instructions on four areas after Peter argued the case against requiring them to keep the Law as does Paul throughout his epistles. You cannot pick and choose which laws you keep, Paul says if you are circumcised you are a debtor obligated to keep them all. You cannot mix Law and grace. This is why they had fallen from grace, in that they were walking under the Law and not grace forfeiting the benefits that Christ meant for them to have under grace. If you are justified by the Law you have made useless the blood of Christ. It has no effect or benefit for you. If we hope for the righteousness that is by faith how can we be justified by Law? If the act that brought people into the covenant and bound them to the Law no longer means anything than as far as justification goes the Law means nothing as well. The Law is righteous, but it condemns and requires daily sacrifices. The New Covenant brings life for Christ sacrificed once and sanctified forever those who put their faith in Him.(Heb 10:10-14) Therefore stand fast in your liberty, Your justification is in Him, not in the Law or rituals and requirements made up by men. Need more proof? Col 2:9 For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. 10 And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:"
"2 Corinthians 11:7-8, 1 Corinthians 9:18","('Paul', 'Crazy', 'Salary', 'Preach')",Assembly Of God," Ever since I have been saved, I have heard that ""Preachers are only in it for the money."" My first pastor was driving a twelve-year-old car, raising four kids on a salary that was equal to what my father-in-law was paying in weekly taxes. Admittedly, when you look at the lifestyles of the rich and famous TV preachers it is hard to not come up with the conclusion that preachers are all about the shekel. When you are living in multi-million dollar houses, wearing Rolex watches, have private jets and expensive furniture in your office it does cast a cloud of suspicion on your motives, mission, and message. I determined early in my ministry that I did not want to be one of those lads. Even if I made it to TV, I wanted to live on a much simpler budget. Some men like Alistair Begg do keep things real as he offers all of his online sermons on an offering basis and if you are broke you can still be blessed for free. My pastor does the same with his online material. A workman is worthy of his hire, but then there is an excessive luxury that neither Jesus, the Apostles or the mighty men of God throughout history ever experienced or desired. Unfortunately, these folks create headaches for the majority of pastors who are struggling because their churches cannot pay them a decent salary and many work full-time jobs to keep both family and church afloat. Others are able to pastor without pay because they have other means of income. These folks do the bulk of ministry in the Kingdom. The other lads have a crowd, but they are not in the trenches ministering to the bulk of the Body. As of July 4th, 2016, there were 323,148, 587 people in America. As of July 18th. 2016, ABC news stated that 83% of all Americans identify as Christians or 268,213,327 people. Add all the mega-churches together and I doubt they come to more than 6 million. They must be at least 2K or more to be considered a Mega-church. There are 1210 in the US give or take. I used an average of 5K per to get the 6 million. So that means that at least 260+ million Christians are getting ministered to by some other means. Some are shut-ins so the TV, radio, and Intenet folks are ministering to them, but there is also a local pastor and church group ministering to them Some of these are full-time pastors with pay and benefits. Many are full-time pastors on SS or part-timers working a job with a small salary while others are not paid at all. So who are the real superstars? With churches in decline, more and more of the pastors are receiving small or no salaries and churches are going without pastors. Some churches still have parsonages, which they might consider selling, but many do not so a man must provide his own housing on his own dime. Their reward is in serving Christ and one day they will get a reward in Heaven. Indeed, some of these churches do more in some areas than some of the big churches. I know one now that is pastored by a disabled Veteran who takes no salary and has a housebound wife. He drives at least forty-five miles one way to minister. They have a soup kitchen weekly and reach out to the poor and homeless with such success that surpasses the ministry of many churches ten times their size and they have only been in existence three years. May others model them."
Mark 5:13,"('Salt', 'Worthless', 'Wounds', 'Cleanse')",Assembly Of God," Mat 5:13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. I am not a scientist and probably only got an A in Mr. King's class because he enjoyed a good argument especially over which branch of the military was the best. I do remember that NaCl is salt. My wife and I debate over the benefits of sea salt or some pink salt. I always say that NaCl is salt so salt is salt to which she begs to differ. For a long time, we went on a low salt regimen and I guess I still am somewhat as I rarely salt my food. Pepper or hot sauce, yes, but seldom any salt as salt is in practically everything including my hot sauce. That is why I prefer fresh jalapeno slices or dried red chili peppers. Having been off of salt for a long time changed my appeal for my mother-in-law's fried chicken that I once thought was the best on the planet. Coming home for a visit, I drooled as she fried it but thought I had bitten into a salt block as I watched my father-in-law salt his without even tasting it. I had lost my taste or craving for salt, unlike Dad who was wanting more though he had a ton of it already in the chicken. Not sure how his body managed to handle that much salt. That may be the problem of some Christians who are always looking for some new thing or complaining about their pastor's sermons. They have been around salt for so long and used to getting it that they were crying for more though they as the Body of Christ may not have been processing it as they should have thus they craved more seeking the benefit and flavor they should have already had. Indeed, they may be as persevered as a body buried in salt, but lifeless. Coming into a congregation like that where the pastor has to constantly up the salt amount can be a bit overwhelming for a new Christian or especially an unbeliever who has been invited. They both may have come thirsty, but may have been given sea water instead of clear water and leaving them more thirsty than when they came in. The meat may have been too salty as well quenching their hunger not satisfying it. They leave with a bad taste in their mouth. If they had some wounds, too much salt may have been dumped into the wounds rather than just enough to promote healing and prevent the infection of bitterness or despair. In essence, the salt was useless and they cast it out and walked over it as they left. Some churches try using a salt substitute to avoid people getting their blood pressure up. Well, KCL is used as a substitute, but the K can kill you if you get too much of that as it can affect heart, liver, and kidneys. Yea, blood pressure is lowered, but it can be even lowered to zero with the substitute. Trying to use anything else, but the true salt of the Word will also keep blood pressures down as nothing offensive or poignant may be preached, but in the end, it will affect the ability to process out lies and heresies leading to spiritual heart failure. Not good."
Matthew 15:2-3,"('Truth', 'Tradition', 'Culture', 'Relationship')",Assembly Of God," Mat 15:2 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. 3 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? The problem with the world is not that it that it resists truth. That is to be expected. They are unbelievers that the Spirit needs to convict of the truth and conviction can be painful thus resisted. The problem is that the Church resists truth much as the religious establishment in Jesus' day. That is obvious because the Lord is one and there is only one truth and one Body, not a multitude of truths as represented by our myriads of sects and Lone Ranger groups. The Spirit came to lead us into all truth, not subjective interpretations and doctrines of men.or absorption of cultural norms that are not God's norms. When the Church dumps its traditions and commandments of men, purges itself of cultural intrusions that are in opposition to the truth then we will see unity around the Word, churches merging instead of splitting with one group of Christians per town loving each other while reaching out to the World. When they see one truth being preached and lived in love they will be saved or mad, but most of their excuses about hypocrisy and not knowing which one is right will be removed. This will never be accomplished by the flesh. Indeed, it cannot happen without a move of the Spirit so overflowing that it might be best described as a Tsunami washing away every ""ye have heard it said"" with ""but I say unto you."" When such a cleansing happens we will see a revival surpassing that of all the ones we have ever seen. Three thousand in a day will seem a slow day. The Church will once again turn the world upside down rather than the World turning it upside down. Jesus prayed that we would be one as He and the Father are one and asked that we would be sanctified by truth. We have missed the boat or maybe more likely scuttled it because of the flesh. There will likely only be a small remnant when He returns as hearts grow cold because iniquity abounds. Indeed, He asked if there would be faith on the earth when He returned. Seventy million would be around a one percent remnant if He returned today, but wouldn't it be awesome if the remnant as spoke the same thing and were in one accord dropping the hoo-ha of the flesh and at work in the Spirit? Just as resisting truth has its consequences so does receiving truth. I want the revival, not the redundancy or rituals without relationship that we have so much of today. What do you want? Maranatha!"
Matthew 17:1-9,"('Transfiguration', 'Jesus Is God', 'God Cares About You')",Baptist," Matthew 17:1-9 Opening Our Eyes to God's Glory Do you ever get the sense that you take God for granted? Some of us grew up in homes where going to Sunday worship was expected of us. We grew up always knowing the love of God from an early age. And perhaps we're spoiled a little. We don't remember what it was like to not know God. The story of the transfiguration reminds us of who God really is, of who Jesus really is. I've preached on this story before, but when I studied it this week, I tried to look at it with new eyes, asking God to give me a fresh approach. And God gave me four words that describe our Lord Jesus, and four corresponding implications for us. 1. First, our Lord Jesus is: Powerful - At the Transfiguration, God pulls back the veil and allows Peter, James, and John to see the full, pre-incarnational glory of Jesus, who is in very nature God himself (Philippians 2:6). The word ""transfiguration"" in the original Greek is ""metamorphos"" from which we get our word ""metamorphosis."" Jesus radically changes from the inside out, back to his full godly form. As Paul would later write, ""In Christ lives all the fullness of God in a human body"" (Colossians 2:9, NLT). Jesus shines brighter than an August South Texas sun. In the other gospel parallels, Mark describes Jesus as brighter than any clothes could be bleached (Mark 9:3). Luke compares him to a bolt of lightning (Luke 9:29). Max Lucado writes that this is ""Christ as His truest self, wearing His pre-Bethlehem and post-Resurrection wardrobe"" (Max Lucado, ""Fearless""). The implication for us is that Jesus is more than just a good teacher. He's more than an influential leader. He's more than a superb role model. He's more than a profound ethicist. Sure, he's a prophet, and yes, he's a priest, and even a king. But he is first and foremost ... God! He is God in human form. A child once described him as ""God with skin on."" Jesus told his disciples, ""If you've seen me, you've seen the Father"" (John 14:9). Want to get to know God better? Want to know God's will? Study Jesus in the scriptures. I listen to the Bible on tape during my daily commute. I like to listen to different books of the Bible, but I try to come back regularly to one of the four gospels. Why? Because I want to know Jesus better. If I know Jesus, I know God. Jesus reveals to us the heart of the Father, because he is God in human form. The transfiguration shows me that Jesus is powerful, and secondly, that he is ... 2. Primary. Jesus is #1. He's at the very top of the power hierarchy. Another ""P"" word that describes this is ""preeminence."" Jesus is preeminent in our life. Look at today's story: At first, Peter, James, and John see him talking with Moses and Elijah. And Peter follows his pattern of, ""When you don't know what to say, just say something!"" Do you know anybody like that? Well, Peter says something like, ""This is nice, Jesus. How about if I build tents for the three of you?"" Maybe he wants to stretch out this spiritual high as long as he can. But God interrupts him with a booming voice from a descending cloud, echoing what God said earlier at his son's baptism: ""This is my beloved son, with whom I am well pleased."" And then he adds an extra line: ""Listen to him!"" And suddenly, it's just Jesus. No more Moses. No more Elijah."
Daniel 3:23-27,"('Rejoice', 'Trial', 'Trials')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Here we find a particular passage of scripture that we all have at some point heard the story of the 3 hebrew boys, Shadrach, Meshach & Abednego. Again I like to reiterate that the stories of the bible are real & true not just fairytales. In this particular passage what has happened is this. King Nebuchadnezzar is having some concerns with his male ego. You see in chapter two of this same book Daniel interpreted a dream that the king had regarding a great image/statue that was destroyed & Daniel told the king that he (Nebuchadnezzar) was the head of that statue which was made of gold. Nebuchadnezzar decided he was satisfied being just the head of that statue he wanted to be the entire statue. King Nebuchadnezzar therefore had a image built a huge image about 90 feet tall & 9 feet wide. King Nebuchadnezzar then gathered the political leaders & made a decree that he want carried out. He said whenever the music plays everyone is to bow down & worship this great image. Now when Daniel interpreted the Kings dream Nebuchadnezzar was so pleased that he made Daniel the Governor of Babylon & Daniel in turn requested that his friends shadrach, Meshach & Abednego be promoted as well & that request was granted. So these young men in essence were now in good with the king. Understand that they were however foreigners in this land so they had what we'd call today, ""some haters"". You see these young men were servants of the one true God & they knew that according to the law of Moses ""thou shalt not have any gods before me"" & so they refused to bow. So these haters went to the king & decided to tattletale. They weren't going by the rule that exist today, ""snitches get stitches"". They went to the King & said, sir didn't you say that when the music plays everyone is supposed to bow down & worship your image, well your homeboys aren't bowing. King Nebuchadnezzar not one to be embarrassed especially not in front of his political buddies & surely not by these guys he's considered to be his friends now, he tries to give them a chance to explain themselves, bring them to me. Did you not hear the command I gave, what is this I hear about you not bowing, I know that can't be true. He decides to tell these boys, look you gone bow or you gone burn. Then who is this God that will deliver you. If you remember the story you know they told the King ""look, we not gonna bow, we're not even going to answer your question. Our God is able to deliver us BUT even if he doesn't we're not going to bow down to worship your god"". King Nebuchadnezzar in all of his fury demands the furnace to be heated as hot as possible, & tossed the boys in there, the furnace was so hot that the guards that tossed them in the furnace was burned. and so we are here at our text today. Shadrach, Meshach & Abbednego are in this fiery furnace, the king & his political boys are all standing by watching, The king looks into the mouth of the furnace & sees something strange. I imagine if he wore glasses he probably took them off & cleaned them. He said to his guest, didn't we handcuff 3 men yet I see 4 walking around free."
Psalms 93:1-5,"('Jesus Reigns', 'God Reigns', 'Ascension Of Jesus', 'Return Of Jesus')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," THE LORD UPON HIS THRONE Psalm 93 This Psalm is about, first and foremost, the Creator God upon His throne. He is ""robed with majesty"" (Psalm 93:1). He has also, incidentally, ""established"" the created order. However, we are not to worship the creation (I interject), as it is only the Creator who is ""from all eternity"" (Psalm 93:2). There may be aspects of creation which man considers 'awesome' - such as the ""floods"" / seas / literally ""rivers"" (Psalm 93:3) - but the Creator is without a doubt greater than His creation (Psalm 93:4). Israel was aware of this, having seen His mastery of both the Red Sea, and the River Jordan. The permanence of the LORD guarantees the permanence of His order. We see this elsewhere in the Bible: 'The heavens declare the glory of God' (Psalm 19:1); 'The law of the LORD is perfect' (Psalm 19:7); 'The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring for ever' (Psalm 19:9). Result: ""holiness adorns your house for ever"" (Psalm 93:5). Jesus spoke of 'a certain nobleman' who 'went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return' (Luke 19:12). Some of the subjects of this nobleman sent a message after him, saying, 'We will not have this man to reign over us' (Luke 19:14). Some of Jesus' hearers may have thought that the 'nobleman' represented Herod: but in fact, he represented Jesus. Forty days after His resurrection, Jesus was taken up in a cloud, and received out of the sight of His disciples (Acts 1:9). This is an earth's-eye view of the ascension. The disciples were reassured of Jesus' return (Acts 1:11; cf. Matthew 24:30; Revelation 1:7). Meanwhile, Jesus was received into heaven to take His seat at the right hand of God (Psalm 110:1). The prophet Daniel was allowed a glimpse of this awesome moment from the perspective of heaven (Daniel 7:13-14). When the work of new creation (which began with Jesus' resurrection) is completed, there is another enthronement to come (Revelation 11:15). As we sing, 'Every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess, that Jesus Christ is Lord' (cf. Philippians 2:10-11). However, be warned: those servants in Jesus' parable who refused to have their lord to reign over them were dealt with accordingly (Luke 19:27). In the meantime, the Lord is upon His throne (Psalm 93:1), and reigns for ever (Psalm 93:5)."
Romans 8:5-10,"('Growth', 'Holiness', 'Sanctification')",Christian/Church Of Christ," THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THE LIFE OF A CHRISTIAN Someone has said, ""You will never truly know the power of God until you need the power of God."" I think that statement equally applies to God's Holy Spirit. As we mentioned earlier in this series, too often Christians and churches do not seek nor even rely on God's Spirit in daily living. American independence has taught us to ""do it yourself"" and then if you encounter problems ask for help. But, that is not God's plan nor preference. Also, our restoration heritage, with men like Alexander Campbell and his Baconian rationalism has steeped us in mentally formulating our rules of thinking. Since Campbell's death, our fellowship has largely followed tradition at the expense of seeking the heart of Christ in our thinking and actions. Barton W. Stone, a pioneer in the American Restoration Movement, believed in and was led more by the Holy Spirit than any other person, I suppose. The Cane Ridge meeting was a Communion like no other. On Friday, August 6, 1801 an estimated 20,000 people rode or walked into the remote outpost of Cane Ridge, KY. Men, women and children moved from one preaching venue to another, watching, praying, preaching, weeping, groaning, and falling. Though some stood at the edges and mocked, most left marveling at the wondrous hand of God. The Cane Ridge Communion quickly became one of the best-reported events in American history, and according to Vanderbilt historian Paul Conkin, ""arguably ... the most important religious gathering in all of American history."" It ignited the explosion of evangelical religion, which soon reached into nearly every corner of American life. For decades the prayer of camp meetings and revivals across the land was ""Lord, make it like Cane Ridge ."" The unusual events of Cane Ridge fanned the flames of what was known in America as the Great Awakening. What was it about Cane Ridge that gripped the imagination? Exactly what happened? . . . Europeans visiting the American wilderness and encountering a revival firsthand were convinced that Americans had gone mad. But the excitement was evident far beyond the emotional fervor of the camp meetings. For a brief period from 1832-1849 there was both an appeal for unity and an effort to have unity between all religious beliefs. There was an increased interest in the Bible, evangelism and conversion. However, the appeal for unity led to heated debates and schisms. Disagreements become so sharp that divisions occurred down party lines and creeds became more important that the appeal to God's Word. In recent days, water-boarding is back in the news. I find it interesting that a form of this was used in the early days of religion in this country. Here is a picture of what happened to those who disagreed with another parties views. In the very appeal for and attempt at unity, religious denomination flourished and unity and the Holy Spirit got pushed to the outer margins of religious thought and practice."
John 3:5-8,"('Hope', ""God's Spirit"", ""God's Word"")",Christian/Church Of Christ," A DISTINCTION BETWEEN GOD'S WORD AND GOD'S SPIRIT As we have shown in previous lessons, God's Spirit is a distinct personality and a member of the Godhead who dwells in the lives of faithful Christians. He is not an impersonal force or thing. As we've already said in a previous lesson, the word Holy Ghost has tainted our perception and understanding. I give you these two fictional stories to prompt our thinking today: A paramedic was being interviewed by a local TV reporter. The host asked, ""What was your most challenging and unusual 911 call?"" The paramedic said, ""It happened recently. We got a call from a very large church a few Sundays ago. One of the ushers was franticly concerned about an elderly man who had passed out in a pew and appeared to be dead. The usher couldn't find a pulse and it appeared that the man wasn't breathing."" The host then asked, ""What was so unusual and demanding about this particular call?"" The paramedic responded, ""We carried out four guys before we found the one who was dead."" The second story involves a lady who has just been stopped by a police officer. The officer approaches her car and asks her to step out and put her hands on the roof of the car and not move. She was incensed by that request and starts belittling police for not being more active in catching rapists and thieves. She demanded to know why she was being treated like this and the officer said ""when I saw another driver cut in front of you I saw you make an obscene gesture and heard you shout a few profanities. And when I saw your bumper sticker which reads, ""God loves you and I love you"" I assumed this car had been stolen."" God's Spirit and God's Word are not always apparent in the lives of believers. Too often, we use the Holy Spirit as an energy boost much like some use an energy drink. But God's Spirit is more than an energy boost - He actually interprets what we are feeling and thinking and presents those feelings and thoughts to God, even when we are unable to formulate them in our thoughts and prayers. We can relate to God's Spirit ... cooperate with Him ... and make ourselves available to Him. We need to remember that God's Spirit is a personality - a member of the Godhead - who dwells inside the heart of every faithful Christian. And that, God's Word is His truth, revealed to mankind and is an instrument that the Holy Spirit employs. And, Garth Black says, ""The instrument should not be mistaken for the agent. "" Although the Holy Spirit is the source of God's Word, there is a difference between God's Spirit and God's Word. God's Spirit uses the written Word to instruct and sanctify Christians and enables them to bear the fruit of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit uses the Word to convert nonbelievers to Christ and He also uses the Word to sanctify those who have believed. At times it may be difficult to distinguish between the two - they may seem inseparable."
John 16:3-13,"('Guide', 'Trinity', 'Regeneration', 'Spirit Informs')",Christian/Church Of Christ," THE SPIRIT'S PERSONALITY In many Christian circles the Holy Spirit is either neglected, forgotten, or misunderstood. The One given, to unite the body of Christ is the center of controversy ... So often Christian work is so rigidly programmed that it seems we need no longer depend on Him -- yet Jesus said, ""Without Me you can do nothing. "" The late Dr. A. W. Tozer, author and preacher, said, ""If the Holy Spirit was withdrawn from the church today, 95 percent of what we do would go on and no one would know the difference. If the Holy Spirit had been withdrawn from the New Testament church, 95 percent of what they did would stop, and everybody would know the difference ."" As we mentioned last week, some people have the notion that God's Holy Spirit is a glorified ""it."" Neither is he this mysterious and nebulous influence that somehow affects the life of a Christian. The Holy Spirit is a divine person that works in conjunction with God and Christ. He is a person equal in every way with God the Father and God the Son. Before his death, Jesus advised his disciples, ""These things have I spoken unto you, while yet abiding with you. But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you. "" The works of the Spirit proclaim his personality. God's Spirit speaks and teaches as John 16:3 NASB records, ""But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come."" The Holy Spirit is also our guide as we see in John 16:12-13 CEV which reads, ""I have much more to say to you, but right now it would be more than you could understand. The Spirit shows what is true and will come and guide you into the full truth. The Spirit doesn't speak on his own. He will tell you only what he has heard from me, and he will let you know what is going to happen."" We also learn that the Holy Spirit is our guide that sometimes forbids certain actions. Notice Acts 16:6-7 CEV, ""Paul and his friends went through Phrygia and Galatia, but the Holy Spirit would not let them preach in Asia. After they arrived in Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not let them."" Another aspect of the Holy Spirit is that he searches. 1 Corinthians 2:10 CEV reads, ""God's Spirit has shown you everything. His Spirit finds out everything, even what is deep in the mind of God."" When our minds are in tune with the Spirit's mind we can better understand the deeper matters of God's will for us. Romans 8:27 reads, ""All of our thoughts are known to God. He can understand what is in the mind of the Spirit, as the Spirit prays for God's people."" I cannot know everything that is going on in your personality but God does through the workings of his Holy Spirit. God is concerned about the trials we continually face. For non-believers, this is often difficult to understand and quite frankly we too do not always understand."
2 Peter 2:1-2,"('Know The Truth', 'Know Yourself', 'Know The Bible', 'Know About Sin')",Baptist," TELL IT LIKE IT IS 2nd Peter 2: 1 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. 2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. The news media use to tell like it was now the tell anything to sale time. Other people tell it like it ought to be. Not many tell like it still is right is right and wrong is wrong. Sin is sin and you better no it. (1)Tell about the Scriptures. 2nd Tim.3: 15 And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; The liberals hate it and try to change it. The loosed loyal blood bought saints love it and believe it. The living lasting word abides forever. 1st Peter 1: 23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. 24 For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: 25 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you. (2) Tell about our Saviour. Rev. 1: 13 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. 14 His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; 15 And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. 16 And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. 17 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: 18 I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death. The religious left wing limousine liberals put him down. The believers redeemed by the blood exalt him. Remember the roll will reveal the word is right. Phil.2: 9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: 10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; 11 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. (3) Tell about Salvation. Acts 4: 12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. John 14: 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. If you are not saved by grace through faith. You will go straight to hell at death. No guess work no arguing no defense straight to hell."
Acts 9:1-16,"('Paul', 'Moses', 'Israel', 'Gentile')",United Methodist," Was Paul the Gentile Moses? Acts 9:1:19 We will take a look at a remarkable event this morning. The technical term for a vision of God used by theologians is a theophany. This is where God appears in a certain and life-changing way. Moses had such a vision at the burning bush. Isaiah saw the LORD high and lifted up in the Temple. John saw the Lord at Patmos. Peter, James, and John saw the Lord at the Transfiguration. Today we see the life changing experience given to Paul on the way to Damascus. Luke records this event three times in Acts, here, before the Jews in Jerusalem, and then before Herod Agrippa. What us interesting is that there is some difference in the detail of what happened. Here it says that those with Paul were left standing and speechless. They heard a voice but did not see the vision. When Paul recounts this later, he says that they say the light but did not hear what was spoken. The third time it says all were thrown to the ground and enveloped in light. How do we harmonize this? First of all, Luke was a careful historian. He certainly would have noticed the difference in detail and could have harmonized the accounts at the time of writing. It is to Luke's credit that he records these differences. What we have is three slightly different accounts. We have in a sense three witnesses to the event. What has to be said is what happened was both overwhelming as well as utterly unexpected just like the resurrection of Jesus. Differences in detail were bound to emerge due to the extreme excitement and confusion. However, they are in perfect agreement on the important points. This is what makes valid courtroom testimony. If the accounts were identical, then there would only be one witness and Luke would be accused of copy and paste. If taken together, it would seem that those with Paul saw the physical light but not the face of the Lord and heard sound but did not understand it. They were aware that something very unusual had happened. They also knew that the experience blinded Paul, and he had to be led by hand to Damascus. There was one other vision that day. It was not as dramatic in appearance, but the Lord appeared to a disciple named Ananias and directed him to go to the main street to resort Paul's sight and to baptize him. It was a remarkable act of faith for an otherwise unknown disciple. He reminded the Lord of who Saul was, that he had ravaged the church in Jerusalem and had come to Damascus with letters to arrest all the Christians he could find. How would Paul have found these Christians, many of whom were in hiding? One way would be to feign conversion and to be admitted to the flock. He could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. But the Lord assured Ananias that this was for real. Ananias knew the Lord and he obeyed the summons. Ananias was also told that Paul was specially chosen to go to the Gentiles and would suffer many things on account of the name of Jesus. So he obeyed and the scales fell off Saul's eyes. He was baptized, an act of abject humiliation for the once proud Jew, to submit to a ritual extended to Gentile converts to Judaism. Then he was refreshed. Following this, he proved his conversion by public proclamation of Jesus as the Christ. The stunned Jews soon reacted and Paul had to be let down the city wall by the brethren to escape their clutches."
Mark 5:21-43,"('Salvation', 'Miracles Of Jesus', ""Jairus' Daughter"", 'Mysteries Of God')",Baptist," Believe in the Master of Miracles Mark 5:21-43 (Read vs. 34-43) Sermon by Rick Crandall Grayson Baptist Church - Jan. 15, 2017 BACKGROUND: *Our God is, and always has been a miracle working God. Today's Scripture in Mark 5 covers 2 great miracles Jesus performed: Healing a woman who had been terribly sick for 12 years, and bringing a 12-year-old daughter back to life. *Lord willing, we will take a close look at the woman's story on another day, but her story is intertwined with the story of the dying daughter, so for background information, please listen to Mark 5:21-33. Now, with this background in mind, please stand as we read Mark 5:34-43. INTRODUCTION *Martha Hickman told about a time when she had just gone through some serious medical tests. She was fearful of the results and went swimming at the local Y to pass the time. *At the pool, she noticed a dad carry his son over to the deep end. Still holding his boy, the dad dove into the deep water, and a few seconds later they surfaced. The son laughed and brushed water from his eyes as his father guided him safely to the pool's edge. *Right then, Martha realized that she might have to go through some deep water, but God would carry her all the way through. This is the message for us in God's Word today. We can always trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, because He will carry us through. (1) 1. So, trust in Jesus when you are attacked beyond your ability. *That's what had happened to Jairus' family in vs. 22-23: 22. And behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue came, Jairus by name. And when he saw Him, he fell at His feet 23. and begged Him earnestly, saying, ""My little daughter lies at the point of death. Come and lay Your hands on her, that she may be healed, and she will live.'' *Jairus was desperate. His family was being attacked. His daughter was near the point of death. Luke 8:42 tells us that it was his only daughter, and the way he spoke to Jesus shows that she was Jairus' dearly loved daughter. *Sometimes our loves ones will be hurting too, and there will be nothing we can do to help them on our own. Jairus shows us exactly what to do in a situation like that: Go to Jesus! Humbly, boldly, passionately, expectantly, go to Jesus. 2. Trust Him when you are attacked beyond your ability, and trust Him when the disaster gets deeper. *That's what happened in vs. 34-36. And Jesus said this to the woman who had been sick for 12 years: 34. . . ""Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your affliction.'' 35. While He was still speaking, some came from the ruler of the synagogue's house who said, ""Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?'' 36. As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, He said to the ruler of the synagogue, ""Do not be afraid; only believe.'' *You just thought things were bad, but now the news goes from bad to worst. The thunderstorm has turned into a tornado. Time has run out for you, and the situation looks totally hopeless. *What can we do in a situation like that? Keep believing in Jesus! The Lord will not always come through for you with a healing miracle. But Jesus Christ will always come through for you!"
Mark 10:1-16,"('Children', 'Marriage', 'Obedience', 'Divorce')",Baptist," Leaving, Cleaving and Weaving Mark 10:1-16 Rev. Brian Bill February 25-26, 2017 We all wear many hats. Here are three that I put on. "" Pastor. As one of your pastors I have the joy of shepherding God's sheep. Sometimes this involves ministering to people in pain and helping them through the hurts and heartaches of life. 1 Peter 5:2: ""Shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you."" "" Preacher. I also have the pleasure of proclaiming the Word of God. This involves faithful study of the Scriptures so that I communicate exactly what God has declared in His Word. I'm humbled by the admonition in 1 Peter 4:11: ""Whoever speaks, as one who speaks oracles of God."" "" Person. I echo what the Apostle Paul declared in 1 Timothy 1:15: ""Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost."" I am a person with problems and a sinner saved by grace. The first time I spoke at Celebrate Recovery I stood up and said, ""Hi, my name is Brian and I'm a sinner."" The response was immediate as they warmly responded, ""Hi Brian!"" Recently I was with two Edgewood members who invited someone to gather with us in one of our services. One of the guys said something like this: ""We're a church filled with sinners and we'd love to have you join us."" Right on. These roles work together well but there is some inherent tension in them. While I'm called to have compassion as a pastor I'm also constrained to communicate what the Bible teaches as a preacher. When we come to passages that are counter-cultural and even controversial, I'm committed to declare what the Bible teaches. My aim is to do so truthfully in a spirit of grace, knowing that I am a person with problems myself. Jesus is not always ""politically correct"" but He is always perfectly correct. We must settle whether we will follow what Scripture says or what society says. We will not compromise by caving to culture nor will we clobber sinners. We're called to be like Jesus who was ""full of grace and truth."" (John 1:14) As I mentioned last weekend when going through books of the Bible verse-by-verse, we're forced to tackle topics that we might not choose on our own. If you want to watch, listen or read the message that dealt with the topic of sin and hell, simply jump on the Edgewood app or go to edgewoodbaptist.net. Here's a summary of what we learned from the closing verses of Mark 9. "" Avoid causing a follower of Christ to sin "" Cut off anything that causes you to sin "" Live out the cause of Christ Our topic today comes right from our text for today - marriage and divorce. This brings up all sorts of feelings, doesn't it? Some of you are single and wish you were married and there are some who are married who wish they were single. Some of you have lost your spouse and this topic is terribly difficult for you. Before we go much further, to those who are single, please forgive us for making you feel second-class or unimportant - whether that's been done inadvertently or intentionally. It's wrong when we put pressure on you to get married, or make disparaging comments, or tease you, or just leave you out of things. We must stop."
Proverbs 11:30,"('Witnessing', 'Lead By Example')",Church Of God," Proverbs 11:30 He who wins souls is wise. Today we are going to start out with witnessing Matthew 18:19 19 Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."" Amen.[d] I want to talk to you tonight about Witnessing for Christ Notice here in Matthew that the Bible tells us to Go... Go make disciples This is the great Commission Jesus wants us to go out and witness He wants us to share with others ----what all He has done in our life's **When you think about a witness, what comes to your mind ? There are a couple kinds of witness One can be a witness in a courtroom A witness in a courtroom tells what he or she knows about a given situation. A witness in a courtroom can tell the judge what they saw or what they heard.. **Who here has ever witnessed a accident ? **And then there is the Christian witness The Christian witness tells others what he or she knows about Jesus. And what it means to personally trust Him with their life's. They tell others all about how He turned their life's around The Christian witness goes out and finds those who are lost and tells them all about Christ They talk and walk like Christ They not only talk about the Lord----- and what all He has done in their life's They let their walk reflect Him as well.. You see you can always point out those who are living for the Lord You can always tell those who are a great witness... Because there is no confusing where he or she stand.. You know right off that they are sold out for the Lord... Ever word that comes out of their mouths is about Him Ever word is about what is going on in their church. Or what they read in their bible that day... None stop talking about the Lord ...... ---There are some of you here that never talk about the Lord -- You never tell others about what all He has done for you You never tell you're friend or you're family anything about the services we have in here You try and hide you're relationship with the Lord -----and wonder why You're family and you're friends are still lost.. I want you to think for a min......... How many people have I lead to the Lord since I gave my life to Him...? You see its our job to lead others about the Lord The Lord told us to share the Good News and ""seek the lost. "" He said, ""Go and make disciples of all nations""; and ""Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation You see as a Christian its our great Honor -----to share what all He has done in out life's To share the love and forgiveness He has given to us------ with those who have never received Him as their Savior. Christ has given a clear command to every Christian.? GO make disciples...... It's not a option ----------it's a command His last command to us was to make disciples. This command is the responsibility of everyone who professes faith in Christ. He wants us to witness because the truth is ---Men and women are lost without Jesus Christ. And if you're a Christian you know Jesus is the only way to heaven?"
Titus 1:5-9,"('Ministry', 'Elder', 'Pastor', 'Elders', 'Overseerer')",Independent/Bible," For the greater part of this century, evangelical Christianity has been deeply committed to the battle for doctrinal purity. But in many circles in recent years it has not been as committed to moral purity, even among its leaders. Inevitably the church has experienced erosion of its integrity and spiritual power. The Lord requires leaders in His church who are pure, holy, and above reproach. Anything less is unacceptable to Him and should be unacceptable to His people. Moral compromise, like doctrinal compromise, spells disaster for the church. Important as they are, battles to defend the inerrancy and authority of Scripture lose much of their effectiveness if the defenders of those doctrines fail to also defend and uphold God's equally crucial standards of personal righteousness. And compromisers of the integrity of leadership will much more easily compromise the truth. Unfaithful in the battle for sound living, they are much more likely to fail in the battle for sound doctrine as well. Paul's central theme in Titus 1:5-9 is that only a man whose character meets divine standards should be allowed to enter or remain in the ministry. In verse 5 he says: ""This is why I left you in Crete, so that you might put what remained into order, and appoint elders in every town as I directed you"". Paul states Titus's mission with a purpose clause (""so that,"" hina) containing two verb phrases, then proceeds to explain the ""two reasons"" for leaving Titus in Crete (Towner, P. H. (2006). The Letters to Timothy and Titus (p. 678). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.). The island of Crete (156 miles long and between 7 and 35 miles wide) forms the southern boundary of the Aegean Sea. The center of the island is formed by a mountain chain rising to the height of 8,193 feet (Mount Ida, birthplace of Zeus) which is fringed by lower valleys along the coast. Jews from Crete were present at Pentecost (Acts 2:11) and may have carried the gospel message back to the island. The culture of these island people was strongly influenced by Cretan myth and legend. Paul's first visit to the island took place on his voyage to Rome (Acts 27:7-8). He had suggested to the captain of the ship that they spend the winter there. Since he probably had not had the opportunity to evangelize the island during his first visit, he took the opportunity to return to Crete sometime after being released from his first Roman imprisonment (Hughes, R. B., & Laney, J. C. (2001). Tyndale concise Bible commentary (p. 652). Wheaton, IL: Tyndale House Publishers.) For Titus, Paul, he wanted the young pastor to put/set what remained into order. ""What remained/was left unfinished"" points to several serious defects that still needed Titus's attention. The letter points to lack of organization (1:5), unchecked false teachers (1:10, 11; 3:10, 11), and the need for instruction in doctrine and conduct (2:1-10; 3:1, 2). Paul had observed and had begun to correct these matters; Titus must now complete the work. Paul was concerned that the work of grace previously begun in the church should not be left unfinished (Hiebert, D. E. (1981). Titus. In F. E. Gaebelein (Ed.), The Expositor's Bible Commentary: Ephesians through Philemon (Vol. 11, p. 429). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House.). The verb epidiorthoō (put/set into order) is comprised of two prepositions, epi (""upon"") and dia (""through""), attached to orthoō (""to make straight""). It is from orthos that we derive orthodontist, a dental specialist who straightens and aligns crooked teeth. In ancient times, the term was used of setting broken bones and straightening bent limbs, a function of the medical specialty that today we call orthopedics. Titus was charged with the task of correcting and setting straight certain doctrines (see, e.g., 1:10-11, 13-14; 2:1) and practices (see, e.g., 1:12, 16; 3:9) in the churches in Crete that had become defective. The qualifying phrase what remained indicates that Paul himself, and perhaps others, had accomplished some of the correcting he now wanted Titus to complete. Judging from the admonitions that followed, the problems were both moral and theological and involved church leaders. There also were problems of attitude and personal responsibility in the churches. Titus's job therefore was twofold: to complete the organization of the church in Crete and to preserve it from doctrinal contamination, the former being the first step toward the latter (Mounce, W. D. (2000). Pastoral Epistles (Vol. 46, p. 385). Dallas: Word, Incorporated.)"
"Psalms 43:21, Psalms 5:5","('Hate', 'Abomination', 'Protestors', 'Haters')",Salvation Army," Hate What God Hates Kelly Durant 2-29-17 Psalm 34:21 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate. Psalm 5:5 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity. 2. In Catholic South America when you go out talking about the gospel you always run into people who instead of wanting to debate deeply the Bible and how one is living close to God or not, people prefer to tell jokes about the faith. Jokes, after all, allow people to laugh about faults. Laughter after all is a way to avoid confronting in yourself how you really don't like certain people or certain situations with people. Here's a joke just for fun. A priest was driving and gets stopped for speeding. The policeman smells alcohol on the priest's breath and then sees an empty wine bottle on the floor of the car. He says, ""Father, have you been drinking?"" ""Just water,"" says the priest, fingers crossed. The policeman says, ""Then why do I smell wine?"" The priest looks at the bottle and says, ""Praise be to God! He's done it again!"" If you want to know the nature of a person, just look at what incites their laughter! People seem to love political or religious jokes because within the dark human nature most people love to see people in authority mocked. Humans are rebellious! But within the making fun of others we often observe the cruel nature of others who deep inside harbor a hate and disdain. Often people who mock and poke fun of others are the same ones who claim to be so sensitive and so caring for other certain groups of people. But a stream of water is either fresh or salty, not both! People who protest with hate something cannot have goodness and love as well. What you and I see is a serious outbreak of cruel hypocrisy in society in which one group gets to bully and mock another. Christians, for example get mocked and persecuted with impunity around the world while other groups, if they get mocked, go into an outrage and violent fury beating up others, burning down neighborhoods, and demanding legal crucifixion of the ones who opened their mouths against them! The haters today, in our Godless society, are pure evil. 3. Today I am focusing on how in line with God you are with your ways, be they with laughter, anger, love, or hate, yes hate! Did you know God hates? Proverbs 8:13 ""The fear of the Lord is to hate evil: pride, and arrogance, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate"". If you are a Christian with the discernment of the Holy Spirit you can immediately recognize a person that is totally opposite you in their values because most everything they reveal in conversation, in laughter, in love, and in hate is in opposition to the laws and values of God and the fruits of the Spirit. Our world is in such a divided state because a majority of people are carnal and simpletons and have all their wires crossed by misleading information! A Christian obeys God's commands worshipping Him, loving Him and others, and he or she loves all life no matter the sinful condition of the person. A true Christian can forgive insults, and seeks to walk in peace with others, even if they disagree with their sins. A Christian studies the Bible and knows what practices are of God's nature, distinguishing between what is healthy and what is perverse. Within our practice of not hating, we still have the freedom of discretion! We must choose what God's word says at any cost or we deceive our own selves."
Mark 12:28-34,"('Worship', 'Power Of Love', 'Worship In Love')",Baptist," Worship with Love Mark 12:28-34 February 26, 2017 A number of years ago, a radio station ran a contest in which the disc jockeys asked their listeners to answer the question ""Just for fun, when you wake up to the sound of FM-106, call and tell us the first words you said when you rolled out of bed. If you're the 3rd caller, tell us what you said, and you'll win $106."" The contest grew in popularity, as people began calling in and telling the DJ's what their first thoughts and comments were - - - The DJ would enthusiastically respond, ""Caller number 3, what did you say when you rolled out of bed this morning?"" They would hear comments like ~ ""Do I smell coffee burning?"" ""Oh no, I'm late for work."" Somebody else said her first words were, ""Honey, did I put out the dog last night?"" With a muffled response in the background angrily telling her, ""No, you didn't."" It was a funny contest and people were eager to win an easy $106. One morning, something was different. The DJ said his usual ~ ""Good morning, this is FM-106. What did you say when you rolled out of bed this morning?"" A man asked him, ""You want to know my first words in the morning?"" The excited DJ went along with him, exclaiming ""Yes, sir! Tell us what you said."" The man responded with this ""Shema, Israel . . ."" The DJ was clueless and thought it was a joke, and asked ""what that means?"" The man said, ""Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one."" There was a moment of silence. Then the radio announcer said, ""Sorry, wrong number,"" and cut to a commercial. Do you remember what you said this morning when you rolled out of bed? Oftentimes those words set the tone for the rest of the day. For the pious Jew the first words of each morning should be the same, and they were the words spoken that morning on FM-106. They were first spoken by Moses, and I thought I would read these 3 verses in Hebrew, and also let you see the translation next to them. . . 4 Here O Israel, The Lord our God, the Lord is One. 5 And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might. 6 And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart; When I was a young boy going to Hebrew School, I learned this prayer, and understood it was the most important prayer of the Jewish people. Moses followed up that prayer with words which still hold true today and words which Jesus stated as the Greatest of our Commandments. We've been talking about worship for the past few weeks and I wanted to look at this greatest commandment and see what it means for us as we consider worship. To set the stage, we are in the gospel of Mark, chapter 12. Jesus was being questioned by a scribe, someone who knew the law backwards and forwards. I believe it was an attempt to trap Jesus, but everyone walked away a little more in awe of Jesus, including the scribe. 28 And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that He answered them well, asked Jesus, ""Which commandment is the most important of all?"""
Romans 12:1-8,"('Worship', 'Transformation', 'Community Of Faith')",Baptist," Transformed Romans 12:1-8 February 5, 2017 For the past 4 weeks we've been talking about community. We know it's important, but we often struggle with community. We get confused about how to cultivate real relationships, we struggle once we're in them, and sometimes when 2 or 3 are gathered, we make community something which is not to be desired. The goal is life transformation through Jesus Christ. So, what do we do? We find community in other places. We may go to the bar, join a community organization, volunteer somewhere hoping to find what we long for. We may get involved in the church, we may even do nothing . . . or we can do what so many other people have done . . . Get involved in cyber-communities. Yup, cyber-communities are communities you find on the internet. There was Cy-World in South Korea. Cy-World was proclaimed to be a ""parallel universe unto itself.' Cyworld wasn't a game; the goal wasn't to slay dragons or accumulate points but to socialize with 'cybuddies.'"" The website said, Cyworld ""emphasizes relationships between relatives, neighborhood friends, and co-workers -- people who have already met in real life but yearn to also hang out online."" Don't we have that as well? We had MySpace, anyone remember that? Then we moved on to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and whatever is next. When you think about it, our world is becoming more and more impersonal. It's easier to hang out with friends in an online virtual world, than to have face-to-face interaction. We've become less interactive with family and friends. We'd rather talk to someone via texting, than to actually talk to them. When you think about the younger generation, consider the difficulties I believe they will have communicating when all they do is text, and don't really talk to one another. For those who grew up before the texting age, do you remember having a boy or girl friend. You spoke to them on the phone, as weird as it was, and as exhilarating as it was... You communicated and they heard your voice. Rant over! I wonder if the church has followed the ways of this world and become more virtual than real? After all, if you don't want to attend worship, you can always watch on TV or online. So, how can we reclaim true community and worship in the church? In Romans 12:1-8, the apostle Paul offers some practical steps for us to grow as a community of worshipers as brothers and sisters in Christ. 1 Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God -- this is your true and proper worship. 2 Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is -- His good, pleasing and perfect will. 3 For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of you. 4 For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function,"
Genesis 18:1-8,"('Community', 'Worship', 'Worship Feast')",Baptist," Worship as a Buffet February 19, 2017 Genesis 18:1-8 I would like to read a passage of scripture. It comes from the first book in the Bible, the book of Genesis and is found in chapter 18. God has just established His covenant with Abraham and the people of Israel, and God told Abraham that at 100, he and Sarah, 90, would be parents. Abraham promptly laughed. 1And the LORD appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat at the door of his tent in the heat of the day. 2He lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing in front of him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth 3and said, ""O Lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant. 4Let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree, 5while I bring a morsel of bread, that you may refresh yourselves, and after that you may pass on -- since you have come to your servant."" So they said, ""Do as you have said."" 6And Abraham went quickly into the tent to Sarah and said, ""Quick! Get 7 quarts of fine flour! Knead it, and make cakes."" 7And Abraham ran to the herd and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to a young man, who prepared it quickly. 8Then he took curds and milk and the calf that he had prepared, and set it before them. And he stood by them under the tree while they ate. I want to make a confession . . . I love buffets! There you have it. There aren't many buffets I don't like. And once you get started, it's hard to stop. I mean, you've paid for it all and now comes the time to dig in. I remember when Debbie and I went on a cruise, and we went to the midnight buffet. Now, that was fantastic, feed your face, then go to sleep and do it again the next day. We did pretty good at not gorging ourselves, but to watch the people who piled heavy foods on their plates, ugh, it was disgusting . . . but it looked so good. So, what does this have to do with anything? This morning I want to look at how we approach a buffet, and hopefully, I'll link buffet eating to worship feasting! So, how do we approach a buffet? There are a few types of buffet eaters . . . 1. The picky eaters. 2. The I'm wearing blinders eaters. 3. The I know what I like, but tempt me, please. 4. The variety is the spice to life eaters. Now, there's really nothing wrong with any of these. I'm not here to criticize your buffet eating habits. If you want to know, I fall into the 3rd and 4th categories. Worship is kind of like a buffet table - - - When we come to worship we have certain expectations. We expect certain types of music, we expect a sermon, prayer, an offering, announcements, maybe even a corny joke or story for good measure and hopefully someone to welcome and say hello to us. That's kind of our buffet table. There are the picky eaters. They're the ones who are more critical of what's going on. At the buffet, they're critical that the food isn't hot enough, or the restaurant is out of a certain food, or it's too hot or cold inside. That list can go on . . . and it's the same at worship."
1 Chronicles 10:13-14,"('Holy Spirit', 'Discipleship', 'Obedience', 'Holy Spirit Baptism')",Baptist," ""So, Saul died for his breach of faith. He broke faith with the LORD in that he did not keep the command of the LORD, and also consulted a medium, seeking guidance. He did not seek guidance from the LORD. Therefore, the LORD put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse."" [1] ""Therefore, the LORD put him to death."" This is the divine rationale provided for the death of Israel's first king--it wasn't so much that he died in battle, it was that God did not permit him to continue living. Saul had been chosen by the LORD, and he was put to death by the LORD. It is not as though God struck Saul dead; but, the hand of the LORD was against him. Thus, it is quite legitimate to say that the LORD put him to death. Almost from the start, Saul created trouble for himself. In this respect, he was somewhat like so many of God's people to this day. They believe the message of grace, but they want to be ""hands on"" Christians. If God fails to come through according to their idea of ""coming through,"" they will take control of life. The problem with that approach to life is that the cost is always far higher than we imagine. Saul discovered that with great blessing went great responsibility. However, he was incapable of accepting the great responsibility that his position imposed. SEARCHING FOR DONKEYS, FINDING A KINGDOM -- Let's begin at the beginning. We meet Saul, the son of Kish, for the first time in the Book of First Samuel. ""There was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Becorath, son of Aphiah, a Benjaminite, a man of wealth. And he had a son whose name was Saul, a handsome young man. There was not a man among the people of Israel more handsome than he. From his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people. ""Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. So, Kish said to Saul his son, 'Take one of the young men with you, and arise, go and look for the donkeys.' And he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them. And they passed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there. Then they passed through the land of Benjamin, but did not find them"" [1 SAMUEL 9:1-4]. It was a morning like perhaps any other morning. Saul busied himself with the responsibilities of the day until his father, Kish, told him that the donkeys were missing. Perhaps it was during the night that the donkeys had wandered off, perhaps they had been frightened by a wild beast and rushed headlong away from their familiar home; whatever the cause, the donkeys were missing. Kish told Saul to take one of the hired hands and go look for the donkeys. For the next three days, Saul and the hired hand would travel over sixty miles looking for those donkeys! They passed through Ephraim and the land of Shalishah, but did not find the donkeys. Following the donkeys, they drew near to Ramathaim-Zophim in Zuph. Samuel lived in this town situated about seven or eight kilometers north-west of Jerusalem. Saul, worried that his father would be concerned that they were gone so long, was prepared to give up the search; however, the servant suggested that since they were near the place where Samuel lived, perhaps they should consult him. Saul readily agreed to this suggestion and so they hurried into town."
Matthew 9:35-38,"('Harvest', 'Compassion', 'Prayer', 'Christian Life')",Baptist," Live Like Jesus Matthew 9:35-38 Sermon by Rick Crandall Grayson Baptist Church - Feb. 19, 2017 *Probably 50 people have told me that our grandson John Luke looks like me, but I never really saw it until Becky sent us this side by side picture last November. There is definitely a family resemblance, and Christians we will, we must have a family resemblance with God. *God wants us to resemble our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, both with our hands, and our hearts, with our attitudes, and our actions. *On the night before He went to the cross, Jesus washed His disciples' feet. John 13:12-15 tells us that then Jesus sat down and said: 12. . . ""Do you know what I have done to you? 13. You call me Teacher and Lord, and you say well, for so I am. 14. If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. 15. For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you."" *Just a few moments later, Jesus said: 34. ""A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another. 35. By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.'' *God wants us to do what Jesus did. -God wants us to love like Jesus loved. -God wants us to live like Jesus lived. 1. And in today's Scripture this means we should see what Jesus sees. *God wants us to see like our Savior saw in vs. 35-37: 35. Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. 36. But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and scattered, like sheep having no shepherd. 37. Then He said to His disciples, ""The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few."" *Jesus saw the multitudes, but what did He really see? -- In vs. 35, He saw hurting people, people who needed help, people who needed Him. Then in vs. 36, Jesus saw people who were ""weary"" or ""fainted"" in the KJV. They were weary, exhausted, worn out and despondent. The root-word picture is something melting or dissolving. *In vs. 36, Jesus also saw people scattered, like sheep without a shepherd. The word picture for ""scattered"" is sudden motion. It's talking about people suddenly tossed around and thrown to the ground by a heartless and powerful enemy. *One author said: ""Jesus saw people led in all the wrong directions by blind guides . . . Jesus saw people without Him, sheep without a shepherd, people with no protection from the powers of hell, people with no protection, and no real direction in life."" (1) *What did Jesus see? -- In vs. 37, Jesus saw people as a great harvest. Brett Blair explained that this great harvest is made up of ""men, women and children of every age and nation. These people are the most important fruit of the earth, and someone is eventually going to reap this harvest. *To put it in the simplest terms, people are going to be won either for good or for evil. They are going to live in darkness, or they are going to be brought to the light. They will come to see the greatness of living with God, or they will live under the reign of the devil."
Galatians 5:18-6:10,"('Sunday School', 'Salvation', 'Fruit Of The Spirit', 'Goodness And Mercy')",Baptist," First Baptist Church https://www.facebook.com/ThreeSpringsBaptist/?fref=nf Published by NealCarole Gracey February 24 at 7:10am "" Happy ""Fruity"" Weekend, Everyone! I remember one Sunday many years ago a pastor was preaching on the Fruits of the Spirit. To get his message across better he brought with him real fruit. For example, a ""peach"" stood for goodness because a peach is soft and pleasant. A peach is juicy and smooth, kinda' what goodness is like. Goodness is very refreshing. He did the same thing with the banana, the apple, the cherry, and the orange. That, my friends, was a great object lesson that I didn't forget. (Thanks PD) This Sunday's Sunday school lesson is taken from the scripture that includes the fruits of the spirit, Galatians 5:18-6:10. The actual scripture is 5:22, 23 which says,""But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law."" BUT --- the scripture all around these fruits is not soft and pleasant; or juicy and smooth. It is evil and full of sin. Paul here is talking about ""works of the flesh."" What people do before they know Jesus Christ. For example see verses 19-21, which says,"" Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envying, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."" Wow, now that's not good! Beloved, look at the contrast between knowing Jesus and being a follower and then NOT knowing Jesus and not being a follower. Many people may say...I'm not a murderer! I'm not an adulterer! I never delved into witchcraft! Do you realize that Jesus said that if you hate someone that you've already planned murder in your heart? Do you realize that lusting doesn't have to be over another person's spouse, that it can be for more and more money? Did you realize that by reading the Horoscopes and following the star charts and believing in the works of Horoscopes that you are delving into the realm of witchcraft and the occult. Even certain games have elements of evil, especially video games. Soooooooooooooooooooo, what's the point here? Well, the point is not to tell you all what you're doing wrong. It is to show you that when Jesus comes into your heart and the Holy Spirit takes up residence in you, the sour fruit of your soul becomes sweet; the rotten fruit of your spirit becomes fresh again; the unattractive fruit turns beautiful, and the dead fruit is resurrected to new life! Friends, when you accept Jesus Christ into your heart, you become a new creation. You have been born again. You are given new life and a new vision for your future. You are adopted into the family of God. Heaven is your home! Wow, that's a little extreme from just talking about fruit isn't it? It may seem so but remember my friends, Jesus is extreme and His ways are extreme. That's why many refuse to believe in Him. The scriptures tell us that ""the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing."" Jesus offends evil because He is a sweet Savor; a flavor that refreshes and brings peace, and faith, and love."
"Lamentations 3:1-6, Lamentations 3:16-25","('Repentance', 'Repent And Believe', ""Trust God's Provision"")",Baptist," Hope in Times of Despair Lamentations 3:1-6, 16-25 INTRODUCTI0N The year is 586 BCE. The nation Israel had already been taken into captivity. Now, the city of Jerusalem was under siege by the Babylonians. Soon, the walls of the city would be destroyed. The Babylonian army would plunder all the gold, silver, and bronze items in the temple. Then, they would destroy the temple. Many people would be killed, others would be taken captive to Babylon, and the rest would be left in Judah without anything. Their whole society and way of life was being completely destroyed. It is in this context that Jeremiah writes these words. [read ] The words I read are from Jeremiah, a Hebrew prophet whose professional life was from about 626 BCE to about 586 BCE. He is responsible for the Book of Jeremiah and the Book of Lamentations in the Old Testament. The Lamentations are almost like diaries, giving us first-hand insight into the personal life of this man. I. When All is Hopeless We have read the testimony of a man who felt mistreated by God. He felt hopeless. He did not expect anything good to come into his life. Jeremiah's suffering had caused him to lose hope. What has happened in your life that has caused you to feel hopeless? The loss of a loved one? The loss of a job? A habit or an addiction that is controlling your life? Broken relationships that can't be healed? When you are depressed, you feel hopeless. When you feel rejected by those you love, you feel hopeless. When you have a medical problem that resists all efforts of cure, you feel hopeless. When you are struggling with an addiction or struggling with a habit you cannot break, when you don't expect anything good is going to come your way; you feel hopeless. A. Pain is guaranteed for anyone who takes on the task of living. If you're not going through a hard time right now, just wait -- you will. That's the nature of living in a world like ours. Some of you are in the furnace of suffering right now. Others of you have just come out, and the rest of us will be there sooner or later. George Barna, the public-opinion pollster, conducted a national survey in which he asked adult this question: ""If you could ask God one question, what would you ask?"" The top response was, ""Why is there pain and suffering?"" B. We suffer because of our own actions. We may not always understand what thought or deed created a chain of events that has led to our suffering. On the other hand, if you have been a chain smoker and contract lung cancer or have an aortic embolism due to smoking, your thought and actions have been the cause. C. We often suffer because of the thoughts and actions of other people. We are caught in the overflow of events that affect us and we have no control over them. A drunken driver kills a young child. Someone is robbed and beaten up. A driver crosses the middle line and smashes head-on into another car. D. Then, we suffer for reasons that cannot be explained. We suffer because of circumstance. I have head preachers say that there are no circumstances with God. However, if there is human freedom there must be circumstance."
Acts 2:1-4,"('Holy Spirit', 'Coming Of The Holy Spirit', 'Rushing Mighty Wind', 'Cloven Tongues', 'Filled With Holy Ghost')",Baptist,cts 2.1-2.," June 10, 2013 By: Tom Lowe Series: The Early Church Title: The Coming of the Holy Spirit Acts 2.1-2.4a (KJV) 1 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. 2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. 3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. 4a And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, Introduction The Holy Spirit did not come because the believers prayed but because the day of Pentecost had come, the day appointed for the ""birthday of the church."" He baptized the believers into one body--""For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit"" (1 Cor 12:13; KJV)--so that they had a living connection with their sovereign Head who had been exalted in heaven. Luke 2 describes the birth of the Lord's physical body and Acts 2 the birth of His spiritual body. The Spirit also filled the believers and empowered them to become His witness. He gave Peter insight into the Word and the ability to show men Christ in the Word. The Spirit used the witness of the church to convict the lost, just as Jesus said He would do-- ""After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not. And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas. And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us. And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them"" (Acts 16:7-10; KJV). But the same Holy Spirit assisted the believers in their church fellowship--""And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation. Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles. And all that believed were together, and had all things common; And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need. And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved"" (Acts 2:40-47; KJV). The original group was outnumbered by the new believers, but there was still harmony in the church family. They worshiped daily and witnessed daily, and ""the Lord added to the church daily"" (Acts 2.47; KJV). Is your experience with the Lord a daily one?"
1 John 1:9-10,"('Repent', 'Repentance', 'Sanctification', 'Repentant Living')",Baptist," REPENTANCE SERIES Online Sermon: http://www.mckeesfamily.com/?page_id=3567 We started off this series by talking about sin and the character of God. When we sin, we become distant from God because He is pure light and there is no darkness in Him at all. We learned that repentance is the mechanism that God gave us to be forgiven and have our relationship with Him restored. Even with this mechanism we remain distant from God because we do not know how to repent God's way. For instance, in the second week of this series we identified seven myths concerning repentance. It is a myth that motivations such as sorrow, preservation, penance, reformation, self-deception, selective and no consequence; always lead to repentance. The third week we explored ten of the most common impediments to repentance and describing seven key motivating factors of a truly repentant heart. Last week outlined six crucial steps of a Biblical model of repentance. Step one is through solitude, meditation and prayer; examine and identify sin in your life. Step two is to have Godly sorrow for having offended the holy character of God. Step three is to confess to God with a broken heart. Step four is to be absolutely humiliated and ashamed of having broken God's commands, considered all He has done for you. Step five is to come to hate any word, deed or action that goes against the holiness of God. And the last and most difficult step is to turn from the sin to embrace right living. These steps are incredibly difficult and without the power of the Holy Spirit could not be accomplished. To finish off this exciting series on repentance sermon will outline seven benefits of living a repentant life. . PART 5: SEVEN FRUITS OF LIVING A REPENTANT LIFE John 15:1-4 Repentance is validated by its fruit. In a world where there are many wolves dressed in sheep's clothing (Matthew 7:15), it can be very difficult to tell which person has and which one has not been born again. To address this uncertainty Jesus says that we can separate the children of this world from God's children by examining the fruits of their lives (Matthew 12:33). Those who bear bad fruit are children of the prince of his world (Ephesians 2:2) whereas those who bear good fruit are God's children. In a similar manner, a person can tell if one is truly repentant or not by examining the fruit or outcomes of their repentance (Matthew 3:8). To tell if one has successfully repented or not one only needs to examine oneself to see if any of the following seven fruits of repentance exists in one's life. FRUIT ONE: CITIZENSHIP IN GOD'S KINGDOM The first fruit of living a repentant life is citizenship in God's kingdom. While almost all church going people automatically assume they are born again believers, unfortunately this is not the case. Even if you have prophesied in the name of the Lord, driven out demons and performed many miracles; this is not proof of salvation (Matthew 7:21-23). To be saved one must ""perform deeds appropriate to repentance"" (Acts 26:19-20). Since a good tree bears good fruit and a bad one bad fruit, one cannot have both feet in Satan's kingdom and expect to bear fruit in God's! To become a citizen of God's kingdom requires one to repent of one's sin and make Jesus Christ the lord of one's life. Only when one is born again is one enabled to truly bear the good fruits of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23). If one has never experienced these fruits, then one should examine oneself for there is a good chance one is not saved."
Philippians 4:13,"('Faith', 'Power')",Assembly Of God," SPIRITUAL SUCCESS COMES IN ""CANS"" Phil. 4:13 INTRODUCTION A. HUMOR: 1. JOKE #1: LAWYER'S REVENGE a. A lawyer's dog, running about unleashed, beelines for the local butcher shop and steals a roast off the counter. b. The butcher went to the lawyer's office and asks, ""if a dog, running unleashed, steals a piece of meat from my store, do I have a right to demand payment for the meat from the dog's owner?"" c. ""Absolutely,"" the lawyer responded. The butcher immediately shot back, ""Good! You owe me $12 for the roast your dog stole from me this morning."" d. The lawyer, without a word, writes the butcher a check for $12. A few days later, the butcher, browsing through his mail, finds an envelope from the lawyer. The contents read ""Consultation fee: $50.00. 2. JOKE #2: THE PSYCH'S DIAGNOSIS: a. A man went to a psychiatrist and said, ""Doctor, I have seen two other psychiatrists. They told me I am cursed with an inferiority complex. I would like for you to examine me and tell me what you think. b. After many tests the doctor said, ""Sir, I have good news and bad. The good news is, you DON'T have a complex. The bad news is, you ARE inferior!"" B. THE WONDERFUL TRUTH 1. That (illus) is exactly what the devil wants you to believe; that you are inferior to others and that others ""CAN"" live effectively for Jesus, but you ""CAN'T."" 2. Phip. 4:13 is a verse that shatters every negative or derogatory thing anyone has ever said to you: it says, ""I CAN do all things through Christ which strengthens me!"" 3. We all have secret fears: a. Of what people think; b. Of failure; c. Of making a fool of ourselves -- and these figures can affect our lives. 4. When I was in third grade, I was in the play, ""William Tell."" I was the bad guy. I was petrified with fear that I might forget my lines. 5. Guess what happened? The thing which I feared came upon me! C. GOD'S GOAL 1. But God wants us to be able to say with Paul, positively, ""I CAN do all things through Christ Who strengthens me!"" 2. Let's consider Paul's revelation for moment. The title of this message is, ""Spiritual Success Comes In 'CANS.'"" I. THE SCOPE OF THE PROMISE: ""ALL THINGS"" A. YOU CAN ENDURE ALL THE TRIALS OF LIFE 1. No matter how big or severe your trial, whatever problems or difficulties come your way -- our God is able to make us overcomers in all of them! 2. Paul was thrown in many prisons, tortured and beaten frequently, faced death often, yet he could say, ""I can do all things...."" This was an amazing admission. None of us have faced what he did; if he could say it, so can we! 3. You say, ""Yes, but Pastor, I'm not Paul. I don't have that kind of grace."" Well you don't have it today, because you don't need it today. On the day you need extra strength, God will supply it. 4. That's why God said, ""As is your day, so shall be your strength."" We may: a. Lose loved ones; b. Lose our possessions; c. Face hopeless/ insurmountable situations, 5. But God has said, ""My grace IS sufficient for you..."" Nothing shall overwhelm us, because ""Greater is He that is in you, then he that is in the world."" Our God is bigger!"
Acts 8:1-6,"('Courage', 'Standing Firm', 'Christian Living')",Christian/Church Of Christ," ""I Wanna Be Guilty!"" : Acts 8:1-6, 4:19-20. 5:27-29 David P. Nolte It's a human tendency to defend our innocence when we are accused even if we are guilty. We may even attempt defending the actions we cannot deny. We may rationalize, minimize, justify or even lie about our actions. We may try to shift the blame. There is, however, an area of life where, when accused by the world, we should boldly and confidently prove our guilt. The question has been asked, ""If you were on trial for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?"" That's one accusation to which we should be happy to reply, ""Guilty as charged!"" But even then, it should be a life, not lip confession; it should be walk not talk evidence; it should be genuine not gilded proof. The song by The Newsboys, and sung by the Boyer Bunch, said, ""If serving you's against the law of man If living out my faith in you is banned Then I'll stand right before the jury."" Consider the boldness of the early followers of Jesus Christ. We read that when Stephen was stoned for preaching Jesus, ""on that day a great persecution began against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. Some devout men buried Stephen, and made loud lamentation over him. But Saul began ravaging the church, entering house after house, and dragging off men and women, he would put them in prison. Therefore, those who had been scattered went about preaching the word. Philip went down to the city of Samaria and began proclaiming Christ to them. The crowds with one accord were giving attention to what was said by Philip, as they heard and saw the signs which he was performing."" Acts 8:1-6 (NASB). Being scattered furthered the cause as scattering seed increases the harvest. And when they were warned not to talk about Jesus, ""Peter and John answered and said to them, 'Whether it is right in the sight of God to give heed to you rather than to God, you be the judge; for we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard.'"" Acts 4:19-20 (NASB). So they kept preaching, and the high priest said, ""We gave you strict orders not to continue teaching in this name, and yet, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this man's blood upon us."" But Peter and the apostles answered, ""We must obey God rather than men."" Acts 5:27-29 (NASB). To be found guilty when accused of being for Jesus we need to present the evidence Just as the disciples and apostles did. What enabled them to live lives that convicted them? THEY PUT GOD FIRST AND THEY HAD I. AWARENESS OF ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY: A. When ordered to shut up, ""Peter and the apostles answered, 'We must obey God rather than men.'"" 1. Now, ordinarily we are commanded to obey the laws of the land: a. ""Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God. Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves. .... Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also for conscience' sake."" Romans 13:1-2 and 5 (NASB)."
Leviticus 8:10-13,"('Anointing', 'Calling', 'Impartation', 'Giftings')",Assembly Of God,ev 8:10-," The True Anointing CCCAG February 26th, 2017 There is a story from about 70 years ago about a new vacuum salesman down in Tennessee. One week he was out in the rural areas selling Kirby's and was really excited about what he thought his machine could do. His first visit of the day was at a farmhouse at the end of a long country road. The man of the house was working the fields, and the salesman figured he would have an easy sell, so he started his sales pitch. He was showing her the ease of use, all the tools, all the attachments. He went on and on about how powerful it was. He said, ""This is the most exciting vacuum cleaner you have ever seen. It will clean your house from top to bottom...you only have to pay so much down, followed by a small amount every month and I'll leave you this one right here"" And the farmwife was very impressed and said, ""It sounds real good, but can it really do all that you say-"" The salesmen interrupted her and said, ""You see that big pile of dirt right there on the floor with all those fur balls and bugs and things."" The farmwife said, ""Yes, I just swept that up when you came to the door"" He said, ""My vacuum cleaner will just pick up all those things up just like that (Snapping fingers) and if it doesn't, I'll eat what's in that pile!"" The wife stood up and walked into the kitchen and returned with a spoon and said, ""Well, you better get to it, because we do not have any electricity out here!"" The moral of this story? You will be sucking up dirt the rest of your life if you do not have power. Last week we talked about the call of God on your lives, today we will talk about the power that's available for your calling. Today we will be talking about ""The Anointing"". In Pentecostal and especially Charismatic circles, it's a popular, but widely misunderstood and misapplied concept, so today we will be looking at the biblical understanding of the anointing and seeing what it is, and why it's important in our lives. We will begin in the OT with the first formal example of anointing. Lev 8:10-13 10 Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it, and so consecrated them. 11 He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times, anointing the altar and all its utensils and the basin with its stand, to consecrate them. 12 He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anointed him to consecrate him. 13 Then he brought Aaron's sons forward, put tunics on them, tied sashes around them and fastened caps on them, as the LORD commanded Moses. Prayer I. The Anointing in the Old Testament As we are doing our chronological reading plan, we are right now in the midst of the intricacies of Old Testament Worship. Anyone with a background in Roman Catholism or even the Lutheran Church will see the parallels in what was happening in the Old Testament here as the Catholic and Lutheran worship and consecration rites are very similar to the way things were done in Moses' time. In Moses' time, the anointing was symbolized through the smearing, or pouring on of oil."
2 Chronicles 34:23-35:24,"('Grace', 'Power', 'Focus')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," FOCUS Facing Opposition Clearly Under Stress Scriptures: Rom. 8:5-9; 12:1-2; 1 Pet. 5:8; 2 Chr. 34:23-28; 35:20-24 The title of my message this morning is FOCUS: Facing Opposition Clearly Under Stress. If you take nothing else from this message remember this: when we lose our focus we can negate the blessings and promises of God for our lives. God will never override our will and sometimes what we choose to do conflicts with what He is doing in our lives. When that happens, our personal will (if acted upon) trumps His promises. Please remember that! We often here of the importance of having focus. We tell our kids that if they focus more on their homework they will make better grades. We tell ourselves that if we focus on this or that then we will eventually get better at it. Focus is defined as a ""concentrated effort or attention on a particular thing"" so whatever you give your attention to is what you are focusing on - good of bad! For example, if you are playing a team sport, you must concentrate on what you're supposed to be doing as part of the team. Each person has a role to play and together with everyone focusing on their specific roles the team can win. When individuals on a team lose their focus and does not pay attention to what they are supposed to be doing, it hurts the team. Now think of this from a spiritual perspective. Do you know that our walk with Christ requires focus? Paul wrote the following to the Church in Rome, ""For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace, because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able to do so, and those who are in the flesh cannot please God. However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him."" (Romans 8:5-9) He also said in chapter twelve, ""Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship. And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect."" (Romans 12:1-2) Paul makes it clear that when we accept Christ we have to ""focus"" on something different. We have to renew our minds to a different way of thinking because our enemy desires that we remain the same and continue to think the same way. Why? Because that is his only hope! He has been stripped of his power when Christ rose from the dead so the power that he exercises in this world comes from what people give him and make no mistake about it, he is a very powerful enemy with a very powerful force supporting him! Because we are facing a powerful enemy, we can only experience victory on this side when we are focused on what we are to be doing versus getting sidetracked by our enemy. Remember Peter said ""Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour."" (1 Peter 5:8) Now let me give you a real world example of how when we lose focus we can lose our victory. For those of you football fans you will understand this as some of you may have even watched this game."
Acts 2:42-44,"('Faith', 'Growth', 'Doctrine', 'Spiritual Growth', 'Unity Of Believers')",Baptist," The Path to Stability Acts 2: 42-44 Today I want to conclude our series: Church - A New Testament Model. Once again we are in the book of Acts, immediately following Pentecost. The Lord had ascended back to the Father, and the Spirit had come, filling the believers. The presence and power of God was evident among the church in Jerusalem, with thousands coming to faith in Christ. Acts 2:41 - Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. At this moment, the church was in her infant stages. Although she was very young, she was also very pure. At this point, the preferences and stigmas of men had not yet influenced the church. The pressures of modern culture had yet to make their mark on the church. She was born in the power of the Spirit and God was multiplying her numbers in a miraculous way. Sadly, very few, if any, local congregations closely resemble that of the early church. We are thousands of years removed, and forced to deal with the influences introduced my man. Rather than trying to imitate the ""successful"" church down the road, we need to pattern our lives and actions after the biblical model. If the church is to possess the power of God, and impact our modern culture, we must seek to resemble the early church. We need to adopt the New Testament model rather than the popular, contemporary model. As we conclude the series, I want to examine the disciplines exercised by the early church as we consider: The Path to Stability. First we discover: I. Their Commitment to Doctrine (42) - And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. Immediately following the miraculous birth of the church, we find they have come together in steadfast commitment to the apostles' doctrine. This speaks of the teaching and preaching of the Word by the apostles. The early church placed a premium on the Word of God. It was viewed as the priority among them. I appreciate the commitment to the Word here at Fellowship. It is viewed as the priority among us. However, we must continue to guard our commitment to the Word, and never allow anything to replace its preeminence among us. Far too many congregations have given the preaching and teaching of the Word a lower place of emphasis within their services and activities. Many have replaced an emphasis on the Word with music, drama, and entertainment. We often hear folks say, ""We had a great service today. The preacher didn't even get to preach."" Modern culture would have us to believe that God does His best work among the church during song services or some sort of entertainment. That may generate a sense of excitement and appeal to the flesh, but it certainly doesn't fit the New Testament model. Many congregations have raised a generation of anemic Christians, illiterate to the Word, because there was no emphasis on teaching sound doctrine! John 8:31 - Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed."
2 Corinthians 5:20-6:10,"('Commitment', 'Lent', 'Ash Wednesday Sermon')",United Methodist," THE MASTER'S MARK ASH WEDNESDAY, YEAR A 2 CORINTHIANS 5:20-6:10 MARCH 1, 2017 FARM HILL UNITED METHODIST CHURCH, HARRISBURG, AR INTRO. Branding your animals to establish ownership can traced at least as far back as the ancient Egyptians. The practice of branding slaves goes at least to the Romans. That mark on the hide of your animals would let people know what did and did not belong to them at any time they needed that information. In the American West, people would run their cattle all together, then the brands would be checked when the cattle were being driven to market to identify who owned what (Wikipedia). Down through the years, brands have been used for different purposes as well. Many of us may have read Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter in high school or college English classes. Hester Prynne, living in 1642 Puritan Boston, is pregnant from an affair with someone she will not identify, but who, we find out, is Arthur Dimmesdale, the minister at her church. Sadly, such things happened even back then. Hester is forced to stand on a scaffold for three hours wearing a scarlet ""A"" on her dress, then is thrown into jail. When she is released, she lives a more quiet life. When her lover dies from guilt, he is seen to have an ""A"" branded on his chest, the mark of his adultery. Many people carry the mark of their guilt in one way or another. And of course we have heard how the Nazis would identify many of their Jewish and other prisoners with tattoos on their arms. A needle was used to mark the prisoners so that, in life or death, the guards would know who they were. But how do people know who Christians? How are we identified by those who do not follow Jesus? It's like the story I read of a woman who found out about a family in her neighborhood that was in great need. The husband had died, the mother was barely holding things together. This woman got them some groceries and other things and dropped them off. The family was very surprised. As she turned to go, one of the boys said, ""Are you God's wife?"" She answered, ""Well, no, but I'm one of his daughters."" The boy replied, ""OK, I knew you had to be related to him somehow."" But what about us? How do the people around us know who we are related to? How do we bear the Master's mark? I. WE ARE AMBASSADORS (5:20-21). Verse 20 says we ambassadors for Christ. What is an ambassador anyway? A person who speaks and acts and lives on behalf of someone else that is not present. The United States does not have diplomatic relations with three countries: Bhutan, Iran and North Korea. There are also six very small island nations in the Caribbean and a very small nation in Africa that we do not have a diplomatic presence in. Of the rest of the recognized 195 countries in the world, the United States has at least one embassy or consulate in each of them (travel.state.gov). All those ambassadors are there to represent the United States, its president and their government. When I took my trip to the Baltics, we visited two U.S. embassies, one in Lithuania and one in Estonia. We got to actually meet the ambassador to Lithuania. He came breezing in, all sharp-looking, wearing a suit that looked really nice and pricey. But one thing sort of surprised me about him. Before he entered the room, different embassy staff had been in and out. I expected the ambassador to come in with at least two or three staffers in tow, maybe a security guard or two. But it was just him. He opened the door, walked in, and closed the door behind himself. And there he was, the embodiment of the United States for all of Lithuania. Now, having been born and raised in America, I understood he was just another American diplomat. I don't remember his name, but he probably had an education at more prestigious schools than I did. Was probably worth more money than I was. I am sure his salary as ambassador was way more than I make. But still, I knew he was just another American."
Revelation 20:11-15,"('Eternal Hell', 'Judgment Of Works', 'Books Of Judgment', 'The Throne Of God')",Baptist," ""Humanity's Date with Destiny"" Revelation 20:11-15 Revelation 20:11 Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them. 12 And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done. 13 And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them, according to what they had done. 14 Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. 15 And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire. Introduction: Question: ""What is the Great White Throne Judgment?"" Answer: The great white throne judgment is described in Revelation 20:11-15 and is the final judgment prior to the lost being cast into the lake of fire. We know from Revelation 20:7-15 that this judgment will take place after the millennium and after Satan, the beast, and the false prophet are thrown into the lake of fire Revelation 20:7-10. The books that are opened Revelation 20:12 contain records of everyone's deeds, whether they are good or evil, because God knows everything that has ever been said, done, or even thought, and He will reward or punish each one accordingly Psalm 28:4; 62:12; Romans 2:6; Revelation 2:23; 18:6; 22:12. Also at this time, another book is opened, called the ""book of life"" Revelation 20:12. It is this book that determines whether a person will inherit eternal life with God or receive everlasting punishment in the lake of fire. Although Christians are held accountable for their actions, they are forgiven in Christ and their names were written in the ""book of life from the creation of the world"" Revelation 17:8. We also know from Scripture that it is at this judgment when the dead will be ""judged according to what they had done"" Revelation 20:12 and that ""anyone's name"" that is not ""found written in the book of life"" will be ""thrown into the lake of fire"" Revelation 20:15. The fact that there is going to be a final judgment for all men, both believers and unbelievers, is clearly confirmed in many passages of Scripture. Every person will one day stand before Christ and be judged for his or her deeds. While it is very clear that the great white throne judgment is the final judgment, Christians disagree on how it relates to the other judgments mentioned in the Bible, specifically, who will be judged at the great white throne judgment. GotQuestions.Org I. The Throne What can we learn from what John saw? a. The Power Out text states that John saw ""...a great white throne and him who was seated on it..."" The word ""great"" suggests the idea of supremacy, preeminence power, majesty and glory. The prophet Daniel saw a vision of all other thrones being ""...cast down..."" in Daniel 7:9 I beheld till the thrones were cast down,"
Ephesians 1:11-12,"('Plan', 'Purpose', 'Purpose In Life')",Baptist," ""Finding your Purpose"" Ephesians 1:11-12 Listen to what God's word says in Paul's letter to the church in Ephesus. Eugene Peterson who wrote the message paraphrased this verse... Here it is...""It's in Christ that we find out who we are and what we are living for. Long before we first heard of Christ... He had his eye on us, had desires on us desires on us for glorious living, part of the overall purpose he is working out in everything and everyone."" Ephesians 1:11 Rick Warren wrote two books that have revolutionized the way churches do ministry today. One of those is The Purpose Driven Church. That book in a nutshell helped churches across America realize that we must be focused on God's purpose for the church not man's purpose. Too many churches today are full of individuals who are there to make power plays and to control the church for their own selfish motives. I read and study that book as we started Eagle's landing 17 years ago to make sure we would not fall into that trap. Then he wrote the book The Purpose Driven Life. You can read it for free online. That book has now sold over 32 million copies in 50 languages and here's why. The book touches a nerve with people today. You see most of us are tired and weary of the same old, same old woman he come to church. We don't want to feel like when we attend that we are simply going through the motions. People no longer come to church because it is the right thing to do. I mean it is but people who come now do so because they're looking for something deeper... Right? Right! We come here looking to find our purpose in life... Because at some point in life every one of us will pause and asked several questions. One of these is this... What on earth am I here for? Because life is more than work; it is more than food; it is more than sleep. Yet we spend about one third of our lives sleeping, one third of our lives working and probably too much time eating. And somewhere in all that it is the right thing to stop and ask, what is it that should be driving my life? "" Many people are driven by the wrong things. Guilt, anger, resentment, fear. We allow our past to control our future. That makes Satan very happy. He is pleased when we allow our past to consume our present. We are products of our past but we do not need to be prisoners of our past. We become bitter and we allow our past to continue to hurt us. "" Others are driven by materialism or approval. We too often think life is all about what we can acquire. I saw a bumper sticker on a nice truck one fellow was driving... It's said in the end, the guy with the most toys wins. We think that by getting more and more or my pleasing everyone that we will somehow have the approval of everyone. And it is an exhausting way to live. So this is the answer to the question of what on earth am I here for? It is to live your life on purpose, with a purpose. Now the next question clearly is what is that purpose and how do I find it? I believe there are five truths we need to know in order to accomplish this."
"Hebrews 13:8, Numbers 23:19","('Unchanging God', 'Unchanging Truth')",Christian/Church Of Christ," UNCHANGING GOD Life can be full of changes. Sometimes it's for the better; sometimes it's not. Some surprises are joyous; some-not so much. Adjusting to life's curve balls can cause tension and anxiety. Life is unpredictable. Although it would be nice to go through life knowing what to expect it doesn't work that way; we can't get through life without dealing with changes. People go through changes too; sometimes for the better-sometimes not. Thus, people can be unpredictable. You think you know a person and then they do something to completely catch you off guard. But there's one whom we can count on to never change; one whom we never have to worry about having mood swings or changing his mind about something-God. It's good to know we have someone in our lives whom we can count on to always be the same. Let's take a look at our unchanging God. 1) God's love is unchanging. Love can be one of those things that can be subject to change. Today it's, ""I'd swim the ocean blue if it meant I would be always be with you."" Tomorrow it's, ""You can forget about me swimming that ocean blue because I've just found someone new; so toodle-loo."" The Supremes sang a song titled, ""In and Out of Love"". It has some interesting lyrics: ""Keep falling in and out of love. In search for what I'm dreaming of. I long to find a love I'm sure about. That certain kind of love that moves all doubts. Just when I feel sure love's here to stay. It seems to suddenly just fade away. Can't seem to find that everlasting love. That this heart of mine needs so much of."" I wonder how many heart-broken people share that sentiment. Not that two people can't find that forever love but the perfect love that we can be 100% sure about, the kind of love that completely removes all doubts, the kind of love that's absolutely here to stay; that truly everlasting love we need so much is found in God. Speaking of songs, we sing one that states, ""Your love is amazing; steady and unchanging."" David was focused on singing about God's great love in Psalm 89:1-2, ""I will sing of the LORD'S great love forever; with my mouth I will make your faithfulness known through all generations. I will declare that your love stands firm forever, that you established your faithfulness in heaven itself."" Isn't that just a wonderful thought; God's love being firm and forever? We never have to worry about whether God's love is conditional or whether it's altered by feelings. We may never find that steady, unchanging love in another person but we can be confident of finding it in God. His love never changes; it is always at the full mark. He has loved us to the fullest from the moment he created us. He didn't love us less before we knew him verses after we put our faith in him. He doesn't love us more the more we love him. His love for us is not dependent on anything but his perfect nature. That can be hard to wrap our brain around because we're humans and that's not how typical human beings operate. And because of that, Satan will try to mess with our heads. He'll try to convince us that God doesn't love us or that because of what we've done he has stopped loving us or that he loves us less. He will try to get us to look at God as if he operates like a human."
2 Kings 8:1-13:25,"('Responsibility', 'Duty', 'Unpleasant', 'Tedious')",Independent/Bible," When You Have to Do What You Don't Want to Do (2 Kings 8:1-15, 9:1-10, 13:14-25) 1. Sometimes you have to do what you have to do. In 1935, Charles Darrow brought his invention of Monopoly to Parker Brothers. The experts at Parker Brothers rejected the game for ""containing fifty-two fundamental errors."" The persistent Charles Darrow had spent the year after his rejection demonstrating the potential success of the game by selling numerous editions of the board game himself. One year later in 1936, Mr. Darrow was well-received by Parker Brothers who helped make the unemployed heating engineer from Germantown, Pennsylvania, a multi-millionaire. Since that time, over 100 million copies of Monopoly have been sold in 31 countries. Each year Parker Brothers prints more than $40 billion worth of Monopoly money--more than twice the amount printed annually by the U.S. Mint. Monopoly's success has produced 3.2 billion of those little green houses, enough to circle the globe. [Larry Freeman] * ""The Game of Life,"" Lee Strobel, Seeds Tape Ministry, July 28, 1991 2. Sometimes, what you have to do is not just self-marketing, sometimes it is awful. Some of you may have war or police stories that come to mind. 3. This is our last message on the Life of Elisha, and it ends with so summary miracles that were pure duty. Main Idea: God and His Word may dictate that we do things we would rather not do or be involved in unpleasant situations we would rather avoid. It is when we obey but don't feel like obeying that we really honor God the most. I. Let's Take A Look At Elisha's DISTASTEFUL Duties (8:1-15, 9:1-10, 13:14-25). A. EVICTING a widow (1-6) B. Anointing a Syrian king who would be worse than his PREDECESSOR (7-15) When Hazael heard the prophesy, he denied that he was the type of person to commit war crimes and act as a barabarian. C. Anointing a king who would replace a king FRIENDLY to Elisha (9:1-10) The curse on Ahab, Jezebel still alive. Joram better, but still not good. Elijah was to anoint new king, passed on to Elisha. Elisha didn't want to do it, IMO. He sent his disciple to anoint Jehu. D. Having his grave DEFILED to perform a posthumous miracle (13:14-25) Elisha had received a double portion of the Spirit's power than Elijah had. Although his soul was with the LORD, he was one miracle short of double, until this one. 14-28 Andrew Drury writes, ""This is the final reference to Elisha's ministry of 50 to 60 years, after 10-15 years of his apprenticeship to Elijah."" II. God Ways -- Even When Difficult -- Are the BEST. A. This drama called life is not without PURPOSE. The forces of good vs. the forces of evil. We know who will win. Our personal goal: to glorify God by loving Him and loving others, esp. via the Gospel of atonement. B. People CHANGE and are not aware of their own evil inclinations. All of us who are people have this problem, in varying degrees Hazael, who would become king of Syria, could not believe he would become barbaric and cruel in war. Lust for power, control, self-exaltation."
James 1:27-2:13,"('Favoritism', 'Discrimination', 'Prejudice', 'Accepted By Grace')",Baptist," Bona Fide A study of James Part 8 ""Stupid is as stupid does"" Many times in the movie Forrest Gump Forest played by Tom Hanks Is asked the question Are you stupid or something? And Each and every time he is asked this question His reply is Stupid is as stupid does What this means is that a person's actual IQ has little to do with common sense And that a person's actions, words and love will show them for what and who they really are You see we are identified by how we act. This brings us back to our study of James this morning James has been laying out strong life principals for us To show us good and smart guidelines for living a good and genuine Christian life We have called that Bona Fide In his book James has drawn dots for us that when connected help us with our actions Our words Our thoughts And help us spread the light of Jesus to the word by each of these methods Let me recap last week's teaching in order to tie this week's right on in The focus of last week's message was controlling or taming our tongue James 1: 26 was the basis for that teaching James 1:26 "" If you claim to be religious but don't control your tongue, you are fooling yourself, and your religion is worthless."" Last week should have been a real eye opener for all of us We saw how James says That our words Our Actions Our compassion and our love are the true indicators of being a Bona Fide Believer We saw how words can and do hurt others and even discussed some ways that we have been hurt by words as well Loving words should come from a growing relationship with Christ Harmful words don't come from him ----Pause----- So we come full circle once again In our Study of James We keep back tracking and picking up pieces of the puzzle that were laid down in the prior weeks Why? Because it all ties together Learning to overcome temptations and trials with joy Learning to trust in God for everything and rely on him alone, unwavering in our love and dedication for him Dealing with our own hearts and our own desires and temptations Honestly Using the mirror of scripture Making changes where they are needed And then putting feet to our faith Doing what the word says These are all steps to becoming more like Christ These are all steps towards becoming Bona Fide And they all connect to form a picture And when connected properly That Should look like Christ' picture ---Pause---- James picks up from his introduction to taming the tongue With verse 27 James 1:27 ""Pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the Father means caring for orphans and widows in their distress and refusing to let the world corrupt you."" Pure and genuine Real Bona Fide religion he says Is putting feet to our faith Action to our words Look at verse 27b with me ""Caring for orphans and widows in their distress"" Acting on our faith James was writing to believers in a time when there was no kind of aid for a family who lost their father or husband The woman and kids would be left to fend for themselves"
John 2:1-11,"('Paul', 'Mary', 'Baptism', 'Wine', 'Pentecost', 'Prayer', 'Peter', 'Miracles', 'Alcohol', 'Testimony', 'Grave', 'Cana', 'Silas', 'Galilee', 'Purification', 'John The Baptist', 'Mixed', 'Pew Forum', 'Talmud', 'Jailer', 'Chicago', 'Miracles General', 'Throne Room', 'Stone Jars', 'Miracle', 'Pay Attention', 'Calling Card', 'Packaging', 'Manifested', 'Bathroom Reader', 'Sign', 'Philippian', 'Rabbis', 'Appeal To God', 'Devon Hudson', 'Finger Of God', 'Greg Smith', 'Maccabees', 'Npr', 'Mayor', 'Illinois Department', 'Traffic Control', 'Uncle John', 'Federal Uniform', 'Transportation', 'Stop Sign', 'Oak Lawn')",Christian/Church Of Christ," OPEN: The Chicago suburb of Oak Lawn had a problem - motorists weren't coming to a complete stop at stop signs. So in 2007 the Mayor came up with a creative solution. He added a second, smaller octagonal sign the town's 50 or so stop signs that read: ""STOP And smell the roses"" ""STOP No really, you gotta stop"" Or I'm Telling Your Mom,"" In the naaaame of love."" And - it worked!!! People stopped at the stop signs. The additional signs were so imaginative and humorous people laughed and obeyed the Stop sign. Everybody laughed... except the Illinois Department of Transportation which deemed the signs violations of the Federal Uniform Traffic Control Act, and threatened to withhold funds if the signs weren't removed. Sadly, the Mayor had to comply. (Uncle John's Endlessly Engrossing Bathroom Reader, p. 253) The Mayor's believed that if he could just get the motorists to pay attention, then he could get his message across. The message... STOP! It was an important message... he was using special signs to get it across. Signs have always been used to get messages across to people. Whether square, rectangular, triangular, or octagonal... there is a message tied to the sign. Sometimes the sign's message is very important and even critical In our text this morning we're told: ""This (changing water into wine) was the first of his SIGNS, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory. And his disciples believed in him."" John 2:11 One scholar went through the Gospels and found at least 35 different miracle/signs that Jesus did during His ministry. But John explained at the end of his Gospel: ""Now there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written."" (John 21:25) In other words, Jesus probably did a whole lot more MIRACLES during His ministry, but these 35 or so that are listed in the Gospels were intended to teach us something. They were like SIGNPOSTS showing us God's message. In fact, that WAS the purpose of miracles. When Peter preached at Pentecost he said: ""Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and SIGNS..."" Acts 2:22 And later in the book Gospel of John we're told ""Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name."" John 20:30-31 In other words... the miracles that Jesus did were intended to get people's say: PAY ATTENTION! This is the Son of God... this is the one you need to listen to! Now, I'm going to repeat a SIGN is something that God used to tell us something. There was a message there... something God wanted us to see about Jesus. And so for the better part of this sermon we're going to focus on the purpose of Biblical signs in general and of this particular sign in John 2. BUT, before we do that, I want to spend just a couple moments addressing something that many people struggle with in this passage. To the modern day reader the free flowing wine at parties such as this one in Scripture lead some to think that this ""quite a party"". It would seem that many were drunk and that many there were ""feeling no pain."""
Esther 4:11-11:14,"('Esther', 'Prayer', 'Courage', 'Deliverance', ""God's Providence"")",Christian/Church Of Christ," The 3 C's of a Healthy Church - Support Your Leaders Esther 4:11-14 (p. 346) March 5, 2017 Introduction: I read this statement the other day...""Make sure all the people in the boat with you are rowing and not secretly drilling holes when you're not looking. Know YOUR CIRCLE."" I like that because leaders that are in the same boat together rowing hard to get to a specific destination are a focused team...but if you have one or two secretly drilling holes while all the others are rowing, there's gonna be trouble. Be very selective about who you let into the leadership boat...especially when it comes to Jesus' Church because the direction is always determined by the Holy Spirit...and it takes wisdom and courage to row where He points the rudder. It's important to know your circle because hole drillers usually find each other and it's a lot harder to row consistently in the direction God's called you than to drill holes. God's Word is filled with this truth...Moses and Aaron dealt with it...Nehemiah rebuilding the wall dealt with it...Job dealt with it...Jesus continually dealt with it...God allows it because He will continually test our faith and endurance. He will continually identify weeds...and he will continually grow His wheat...Vance Havner said, ""Satan isn't attacking the church, he's joining it...he would much rather sow tares than pull up wheat."" This powerful truth should drive us to our knees seeking God's wisdom...and it should put iron in our back, to continue rowing in the direction of eternity...The Spiritual health of Christ's body, the Church, is at stake. A little background concerning Esther is necessary. Her story is a story of hole drillers and true leadership. It's the story of the Jews under the captivity of the Persian King Xerxes...and it happens about 465 BC. A woman named Esther, and her cousin and guardian Mordecai are jews in exile in Persia. It's the story of how they work to rescue God's people from a plot to destroy them. The book of Esther never mentions God by name, but His hand of protection and His plan are woven through the entire story...it's a story of providential leadership...and it's a story of courage. Esther, the Jewish exile, becomes Xerxes' queen...via a beauty contest (it's not a story of political correctness). She has attained this place of power by God's design. But enter the hole driller...His name is Haman. And his ego is bigger than Persia ESTHER 3:1-6 (p. 345) Haman hates Mordecai...He hates him so much that he not only wants to kill him, but he wants to kill every one of his people. And he devises a plan to carry it out. ESTHER 3:8-11 (p. 346) When Mordecai learns of this he tears his clothes, puts on sackcloth and ashes and grieves bitterly. But, he also sends a messenger to his adopted daughter, Esther... ""Go before the King, beg for mercy...plead for your people."""
"Joel 2:12-13, Genesis 3:17-19","('Sin', 'Confession', 'Repentance', 'Ash Wednesday')",*other," Ash Wednesday: A Confession ""Return to me, says the Lord, with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning, and rend your hearts and not your garments. Return to the Lord your God, for He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love."" (Joel 2:12-13) Intro: Sin, confession/repentance, mortality, death...Many times these are not this that ordinary people delight in discussing. Sin- the truth that there IS right and wrong and that we make very bad mistakes and are much more less than perfect. Confession and repentance, the idea of sharing your most shameful failures with another. Mortality, the reality that our lives are brief and fragile and will one day end. Death, the fear of the unknown, the question mark at the end of our lives- what will we face? There's no escaping it or changing it no matter HOW advanced our technology or medicine gets. No matter how rich or powerful or intelligent we become in this life, we are ALL created beings, we ALL have a beginning, and we ALL have an end. And today is the day we as Christians remind ourselves of all of these things. Not for the mere fact to depress ourselves, but to remind ourselves that God is God and WE ARE NOT, that His ways ARE HIGHER THAN OUR WAYS and that we as created beings are completely indebted to the grace and mercy of our God and ONLY have salvation through cross and sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Scripture tells us that God resists the proud, but gives grace unto the humble. It also tells us that everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself, the same will be exalted. Friends, today is a day to put aside all pride, to empty ourselves of everything great that we think we are and focus on God. The Bible is very clear: we are finite beings that have a beginning and an end who will one day answer to God, and God alone. Therefore, we MUST align ourselves with HIS reality, with HIS way, and with HIS requirements. Today, is a day we actively remind ourselves of that. We MUST not hide from the truth of death and of the consequences of sin, we MUST remind ourselves and others that the ONLY way to deal with sin and the ONLY way to overcome our own mortality and death is by humbling ourselves before the mighty hand of God, by confessing our sins, by repenting from our offensive ways to God and by simply receiving His mercy, and grace and forgiveness. So today I'd like to do something a little different; today I'd like to remind us of all of these things that we do not like to think on- almost by way of a lengthy prayer, I'd like to preach this sermon almost as a confession of our inadequacy and humility. By doing this today, we pause to take our eyes wholly off ourselves and turn them back on God- the author and finisher of our faith. By doing this, we glorify Him, we worship and honor Him. Let us honor Him now as we are reminded of our smallness, our sinfulness our mortality, and our need for His grace, mercy and ongoing forgiveness..."
Mark 6:7-13,"('Evangelism', 'Disciples', 'Called By Jesus')",Evangelical Free," There is one major reason why Jesus Christ who is God came to earth. What was it?? Jesus Christ left heaven and came to earth to save people from their sins by dying on a cross. But there are a couple more reasons why Jesus left heaven and walked the earth; what are the other reasons besides dying on a cross?? 1. Jesus Christ came to earth to teach people about heaven and how to live a life! 2. Jesus Christ called people to teach what He taught! Jesus called disciples! Disciples are followers by learning from and imitating Jesus Christ. All professing Christians are to be disciples of Christ and make other disciples! Let us learn from the Gospel of Mark what Jesus did with His first 12 disciples. Open your Bibles to Mark 6... Read along with me Mark 6:7-13.... What did Jesus do with His disciples? v7a: called them to Himself (called = ""proskaleo"" = to summon = called with authority) v7b: sent them out (sent = ""apostello"" = to send out as ambassadors! It does not tell us, but why do you think 2 by 2?? We'll highlight this again in our applications. v7c?? they were empowered to handle evil spirits And what else did Jesus do in v8-12? Jesus gave specific instructions: What's significant about each one of those instructions?? - Simplicity of life in dependence of God - Stay in that house? (welcome hospitality) - v12.... - v11?? Response to Gospel is answerable to God! There are always new people who need to hear the Gospel! Did the disciples listen and obeyed Jesus?? v13 tells us the results of the disciples obedience! Could Jesus be doing the same thing with us Christians right now?? Our church Scripture verse tells us: Matthew 28:18-20...... Then Jesus came to them and said, ""All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."" Jesus called and commanded the first disciples to make other disciples and the disciples after them were called and commanded to do the same. Today, we believers of Christ are the ones called to be disciples and make other disciples! And so, what can we apply to our lives today as disciples from Mark 6:7-13? The 1st Disciples responded positively to Jesus Christ and were effective in making other Disciples! How are we responding to Jesus today? 1. Do we keep in mind Jesus' summon of us everyday? 2. Are we truly ""ambassadors"" for Christ wherever we go? 3. Every Believer of Christ has the power of God the Holy Spirit! How can we quench God's power?? 4. 4 words to remember from Mark 6:8-12: Simplicity, Hospitality, Teachability, Transparency! - Simplicity! Do worldly things get in the way of our walk with God? - Hospitality! Do we give thanks to God for hospitable people and how hospitable are we? - Teachability! Is there real interest in learning God's Word from us and those around us? - Transparency! God sees everything and will be the final judge!"
Matthew 6:24-34,"('Seek First', 'Needs Filled', 'Two Masters', 'Worry And Anxiety')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Torn between two Worlds Matthew 6:24-34 Have you ever felt like you were getting mixed messages about what makes life worthwhile? What are the things that can make you truly happy? The world is holding out things like wealth and status and power and popularity and Jesus is telling you that the poor are blessed and to love your neighbour as yourself and that the meek shall inherit the earth and to bless those who persecute you. Talk about mixed messages. It's as if we are all living a life that is torn between two worlds. And in fact we are. Today Jesus is trying to help us distinguish from what is good, better and best about living our lives in this fallen world. He tells us that no one can serve two masters. Have you ever tried doing that? That will stretch you in ways that are not very comfortable. Jesus says that we will either hate the one or hold to the other. Or we will hold to the one and despise the other. When it comes to money you cannot serve God and money. You cannot find fulfilment in God if what you really want are the things money offers. The world tells us to get things, get more and more things in fact it tells us to extend this thinking to our relationships as well. So we swallow the lie and try to burn the candle at both ends. We convince ourselves that more money will solve our problems. But we discover we create a whole new set of problems when we pursue excess for excess sake. Sometimes we also burn up relationships like that candle and our desires for excess burns and scars everyone involved. Jesus is warning us about the perils of having a divided heart when it comes to the things of God and the things of this world. Solomon was a man whom God blessed with excess. He was the richest king that ever was. He had 700 wives and 300 concubines. I can imagine he had a very, very, large beauty parlour built on to the palace as well. Solomon had a lot to contend with aside from running a kingdom and dealing with so many family issues. But God blessed Solomon with extraordinary wisdom. Solomon said this about all the getting we do in this world. ""Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding. Proverbs 4:7 King James Version (KJV) Jesus put it in plain language for us; ""Where your treasure is there your heart will be also."" Matthew 6:21 The people of Jesus time were not that different from you and me. They had bills to pay and taxes to pay. They had aspirations for the children's future and they wanted a new home and a two chariot garage. Jesus words are meant to untie the knots of their wants and our wants. Jesus explained that our Heavenly Father supplies our needs. The wants are often our own foolish worldly desires. Our wants are all too often unnecessary excesses. We have no reason to worry about chasing after the things of this world when we have a Father who provides everything we really need. God causes the trees to produce fruit and the ground to produce food. He has given us rivers and streams to drink from. He has covered us with the arms of those who love us. Everything we really need has already been provided for by Him. But many of us are not content with having our needs satisfied we have wants as well. And the world multiplies those wants again and again to pull us away from what God has provided so that we are no longer content having our needs met."
"Proverbs 12:25, Matthew 6:34","('Stress', 'Anxiety', 'Worry', 'Busyness', 'Worry And Anxiety')",Foursquare," Spiritual First Aid ""Handling Life's Stresses"" We cannot talk about stress without also talking about its two cousins, anxiety and worry. They all fit into same category. Stress is a state of mind causing tension and strong feelings of anxiety and worry. Those who are under stress often exhibit signs of increased hypertension, headaches, aches and pains, and difficulty in sleeping. Anxiety is the overall feeling of being worried about the uncertainties of life. It's a feeling of unease and concern resulting in such behaviors as compulsiveness, apprehension, fear, nervousness, panic attacks, tension, and stress. Worry is allowing the mind to dwell on the difficulties and uncertainties that accompany life. Worry produces unhappiness, nervousness, and causes people to become frightened. Things that people become anxious and worried about and that cause unhealthy stress consists of things like health, work, finances, family, and the future. Effects of Stress Certain amounts of stress can be positive, keeping us safe when dangerous situations happen. But too much stress produces anxiety that can lead to several physical symptoms like headaches, muscle tension and aches, restlessness, high blood pressure, upset stomach and nausea, tiredness, fatigue, and sleep disorders. Stress leading to anxiety has also been ""linked to six of the leading causes of death; heart disease, cancer, lung ailments, accidents, cirrhosis of the liver, and even suicide."" Emotional problems also surface such as fear, anger or being constantly irritated, a constant state of worry, sadness, depression, and a general feeling of being overwhelmed resulting in panic attacks. This results in such outward behaviors as eating disorders, outbursts of anger, addictions to drugs and/or alcohol, and being withdrawn from society. So I think it's safe to say that stress is not to be messed around with. There are three realities about stress and its cousins that we need to understand. First, they don't work. Stress, anxiety, and worry accomplish and solve nothing. They're like pushing the gas petal in a car while it remains in park. It revs up the engine and makes a lot of noise, but goes nowhere. They cannot change our past nor control our future. All they do is make us miserable in the present. Next, they're not reasonable. They exaggerate the problem making mountains out of molehills, that is, they only expand the problem making it bigger that its reality. And finally they strangle the life right out of us. This comes from the Old English word for ""worry,"" which means to strangle. Our bodies were not made to handle all the stress, anxiety, and worry we place upon it. So predominate is stress, anxiety, and worry in our culture that a whole new medical field had to be developed to deal with it, Psychology. But the good news is that God, our Great Physician, has already written out the prescription. The Bible says, ""An anxious heart weighs a man down, but a kind word cheers him up."" (Proverbs 12:25, NIV) Anxiety, worries, and stress weighs heavily upon the heart and can cause all kinds of heart related illnesses. Therefore the Bible tells us not to be anxious in the first place. Paul says in Philippians 4:6; ""Be anxious for nothing."" Syl Lobato commented on Mar 9, 2017 This is an excellent sermon on stress. I personally needed to hear it. Check out the scriptures for encouragement..

Acts 2:4-11,"('Holy Spirit', 'Tongues', 'Works Of God', 'Tongue Is A Fire', 'Devout Men')",Baptist,cts 2.4b-2.," June 20, 2013 By: Tom Lowe Series: The Early Church Title: The Sign: Tongues Acts 2.4b-2.11 (KJV) 4b and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. 5 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. 6 Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language. 7 And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans? 8 And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born? 9 Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, 10 Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, 11 Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God. Commentary and began to speak with other tongues, Although glossolalia [Def.--incomprehensible speech in an imaginary language, sometimes occurring in a trance state, an episode of religious ecstasy, or schizophrenia.] is not always a proof of the presence of the Spirit of God, because many pagans practiced speaking in other tongues, nevertheless, in this incident, these men at Pentecost were given an unnatural ability to speak in tongues that were not their own, as the Spirit gave them utterance. The word translated tongue is the Greek word dialektos, and it can mean language as well as dialect. The various languages being spoken corresponded to the nationalities of those present. They ""began to speak with other tongues,"" which was not their native language, though they had never learned any other. They did not speak about things that were commonly being discussed around old Jerusalem at that time. They spoke the word of God, and they praised his name, as the Spirit gave them utterance; significant and important sayings that were gladly received and committed to memory. The situation was probably not that one person was enabled to speak one language, and another person another language (which was the condition of the families that were dispersed from Babel), but that everyone was enabled to speak various languages, whenever he would have an occasion to use them. And we may be correct if we suppose that they themselves understood as well as those to whom they spoke, which the builders of Babel did not--""Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another's speech"" (Gen 11:7; NKJV). They did not speak an occasional word in another language, or hesitantly speak in broken sentences, but rather, they spoke what to them was a new language and they spoke it as readily, properly, and elegantly, as they would have if it had been their mother-tongue; because whatever God produced by a miracle was the best of the kind. They did not speak from a script, from any previous thought or meditation, but as the Spirit gave them utterance; he furnished them with the words as well as the language. Now this was:"
Matthew 6:25-34,"('Worry', 'Worry And Anxiety')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Win Over Your Worry The Habits of Happiness Part 5 Matthew 6:25-34 We all want to be happy. I bet there is no single person who intentionally chooses to be unhappy. However, so many people in this world are not happy for one reason or another. In order to be happy, this is what we have to realize. Happiness is our choice. Happiness is something that we choose. In order to be happy, we must do things that will bring happiness. Therefore, during this series, we are talking about habits that we must build to experience happiness in our lives. And today we will talk about the importance of winning over our worries. We all worry from time to time. Some of our worries are rational, and some are irrational. However, worrying never help us to be happy. This is why in order to be happy, we must learn to win over our worries. What if this happens? What if that happens? We can all agree that when it comes to membership in the human race, worry is a part of the package. It is because every one of us worries sometimes. However, Jesus was very clear on this issue of worry. In a nine-verse passage in Matthew 6, Jesus used the expression ""Do not worry"" three times. Therefore, if we summarize the teachings of Jesus on the subject of worry, we can state it in three words: Do not worry. But before we take a closer look at the passage in which Jesus discussed about worry, let me offer these simple disclaimers. First, do not worry does not mean do not plan. In Matthew 6:34, Jesus said, ""Do not worry for tomorrow."" And some people think that it is a prohibition against career ambition, financial planning, life insurance, or any number of things. However, no one who takes time to read the Bible would say that Jesus had a problem with planning. He planned for His ministry after His death, resurrection and ascension. He spent plenty of time preparing His disciples for Jerusalem and beyond. He also taught that we should count the cost of following Jesus. Therefore, to live without planning is not pure spirituality; it is pure stupidity. In fact, I realized this over the years. If we plan ahead of time and prepare for the future, we will worry less. Therefore, do not worry does not mean do not plan. Second, do not worry does not mean do not be concerned. Some people quote Philippians 4:6 which says this: Do not be anxious about anything... And they use this passage as an excuse for a careless lifestyle. ""Don't worry, be happy."" However, this is not what the Bible is talking about at all. For example, if we do not worry about our children playing near traffic, we are not a good parent. There are things that we need to be concerned about. There is a difference between carefree and careless. This is why the second part of Philippians 4:6 says this: ...but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. Realistic concern and restless worry are two separate things. The difference is this. Concern focuses on the present. Worry focuses on the future. The present is here and there is an action that we can take."
Matthew 7:1-29,"('Church', 'Compassion', 'Great Commission', 'Judging')",Baptist," Excuse Me, But You Have a Piece Of Broccoli in Your Teeth Matthew 7 NKJV Have you ever sat at the dinner table with someone having that enjoyable conversation, and you notice they have something in their teeth, I have and I have found it becomes difficult to concentrate on the conversation until the person either realizes there is something undesirable showing or I have to interrupt the conversation and simply say, ""Excuse Me, But You Have a Piece Of Broccoli in Your Teeth."" I can think a few times that I was the one told I had something caught in-between my teeth. It's a bit embarrassing but you simply say, ""Oh, thank you for telling me""; and you attempt to fix the problem, you ask is it gone, and then resume the conversation. But what if the person who points out the broccoli is someone who eats with their mouth open? You know you want to retort back snidely, ""Well I wish you'd eat with your mouth closed!"" That is a little different scenario from what Jesus said in the 7th chapter of Matthew which has far greater consequences. There he asks us a question we need to know the answer to. It is a life principle that dives deep under the skin, penetrating to the bone and morrow of the spiritual realm, to which we wage our war against sin and corruption on all levels of life, society, culture, religion, character and morality. It is a challenge; a line Jesus drew in the sand if we, His Church and His Children, are to effectively influence the world we are called to minister to; if we are to have any hope of fixing the mess we are in. America is in much need of revival, the world is in need of revival. I am in need of revival; the church is in need of revival! Not a few days set on the calendar when we have a visiting preacher come share some fiery messages, but a heart changed for the purpose of winning lost people and a church that is serious about teaching the 'Observe All things I have taught you."" part of the Great Commission with an effectiveness that can only come for those who have gotten honest with themselves and dealt with the sin that hinders the witness God has called us to give. See, what hinders this work the church is commissioned to do more than any other is that we have broccoli in our teeth. Or Jesus said it better this way: 1 ""Judge not, that you be not judged. 2 ""For with what judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you. 3 ""And why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye? 4 ""Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me remove the speck from your eye'; and look, a plank is in your own eye? 5 ""Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye. 6 ""Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces."
"Exodus 7:10-12, Hebrews 12:29","('Power', 'Prayer', 'Prayer General')",Pentecostal," Exodus 7:10-12 So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did what the Lord had commanded them. Aaron threw down his staff before Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a serpent! [11] Then Pharaoh called in his own wise men and sorcerers, and these Egyptian magicians did the same thing with their magic. [12] They threw down their staffs, which also became serpents! But then Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs. There is a word Jumping in my Spirit today: It's just one word (FIRE). If someone were to run into this house right now and yell (FIRE) The whole atmosphere would change, hearts would race, eyes would open wide, no body would just sit there, we would all be looking for the exits wondering where the fire is at. Somebody would run for the fire extinguisher. I know that's a little graphic, but it's a fact and every bit of that activity would be natural and understandable. Because your life could be in danger. But I want to preach to you today about a fire we don't want to run from, and we're not looking for a fire extinguisher and we're not looking for the exit signs: I'm talking about a Fire we need to be crying out for. (I'm talking about the Fire of God) The Fire of the Holy Ghost. John said: The one who is coming after me is mightier than I and when He is Come, He will baptize you with the HOLY GHOST and FIRE. What we're seeing in this text is a power confrontation: The power of hell versus the power of God. (Or hell versus heaven! Or the fire versus heavens fire) I am compelled to tell you today: The church of the Lord Jesus Christ must catch FIRE. There is an Unholy Satanic demonic Fire that is being unleashed in the earth today (And the sleepy, sloppy, passive, halfhearted slumbering half baked church and church members aren't qualified to deal with it) It's going to take a Holy Ghost Fire Baptized church that can pray heaven down and cast hell out. Hell is on Fire: The devil is sending his fire out against the church. In otherwords (the snakes are coming out of the woodpile) they're coming out of hiding. And I'm telling you that a bunch of wet blankets won't put it out. (You've heard the old saying: You've got to fight fire with fire) Well it's true (There's nothing less than the fire of God that can put out hells fire). Even Shakespeare spoke of this fire against fire Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire; Threaten the threatener and outface the brow Of bragging horror You say: Pastor you're laying it on pretty thick aren't you, (surely it's not that bad.) (Friend)You must be kin to rip van winkle who fell asleep and woke up 20 years later and thought everything was the same as when he fell asleep. Yes It is that bad: And any Pastor any leader any shepherd that does not sound the fire alarm to his or her sheep and to anyone who will listen is failing in their call and (is inviting disaster). When witches are banding together and calling for the country to join them in casting spells hexes and curses against the president and the Supreme Court: WE have a problem and it's not just a disagreement of political parties! It's spiritual warfare."
Matthew 6:24-34,"('Fear', 'Anxiety', 'Worry', 'Solicitous')",Free Methodist," IT HAS NEVER FAILED! SO, WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT 100% OF MOST THINGS I HAVE FRETTED, WORRIED ABOUT, OR WAS ANXIOUS AND TROUBLED OVER NEVER HAPPENED OR TURNED OUT THE WAY I HAD THOUGHT IT WOULD. I WASTED A LOT OF TIME ON NOTHING! WHAT SADDENS AND SHAMES ME THE MOST, IS THAT WITH SUCH DEEP SEATED WORRY, I WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY GET ACID REFLUX AND HEARTBURN. SO, BY COMPOUNDING MY SITUATION MY WHOLE FOCUS BECAME ON FINDING THE ANT-ACIDS/TUMS. I AM EMBARRASED TO ADMIT THAT MY FAITH AND TRUST WAS MORE IN THE ANT-ACIDS TO TAKE AWAY MY HEARTBURN THAN IT WAS TO ""CAST ALL MY CARES"" ON GOD AND SEEK THE ONE WHO COULD PROVIDE FOR MY SITUATION AND GIVE ME PEACE TO THE POINT OF NOT NEEDING THE ANT-ACIDS IN THE FIRST PLACE. HOW MANY OF US FRET AND WORRY OVER THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN OUR LIFE? I AM SURE THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT RELATE TO WORK, FAMILY, CHILDREN, SCHOOL, HOME REPAIRS AND OUR CAREER. THERE ARE MANY THINGS IN LIFE TO WORRY ABOUT. FOR THE MOST PART, RIGHTLY SO! THERE ARE A LOT OF IMPORTANT THINGS FOR OUR LIVES, OUR FAMILIES, CHILDREN AND WORK THAT MUST BE DONE, ACCOMPLISHED OR PROVIDED. HAVING A PASSION AND CONCERN FOR THESE THINGS IS NOT THE PROBLEM. I THINK WHAT JESUS IS TRYING TO TEACH IS THAT WORRY CAN BE JUST AS DESTRUCTIVE TO THE SPIRITUAL LIFE AS IT IS TO OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH. WE SHOULD NOT INCESSANTLY WORRY ABOUT THE BASIC NEEDS OF LIFE BECAUSE SUCH ANXIETY STEMS FROM LITTLE OR EVEN LACK OF FAITH. JESUS IS TEACHING THAT WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT OUR HEAVENLY FATHER IS MORE THAN CAPABLE OF PROVIDING FOR ALL OF OUR NEEDS. IF WE WILL INVEST OURSELVES IN THE WORK OF GOD'S KINGDOM IN THE WORLD, WE CAN BECOME LESS ANXIOUS REGARDING THE FUTURE, IF WE WILL STAY FOCUSED ON GOD. ONE OF THE UNIQUE THINGS I SEE IN THIS PASSAGE IS ALSO WHAT JESUS IS NOT SAYING ABOUT WORRY. HE IS NOT IMPLYING WE SHOULD HAVE A TOTAL LACK OF CONCERN FOR HARD WORK, ""EARNING OUR KEEP"" AND HAVING A CONCERN FOR DOING WHAT IT TAKES TO PROVIDE AND CARE FOR OUR RESPONSIBILITIES. IN NO WAY IS HE SAYING ""KICK BACK AND LET GOD DO ALL THE WORK!"" JESUS WAS EMPHASIZING THAT WHAT WE FOCUS ON IN THIS LIFE ARE THOSE THINGS THAT WILL TRANSFER ON INTO ETERNITY. WE ARE TO KEEP AN ETERNAL PERSPECTIVE OF LOOKING HOW WE CAN IMPACT THE FUTURE AND ETERNITY WITH WHAT WE ARE GIVEN IN REGARDS TO OUR TIME, MATERIAL POSSESSIONS, AND EVEN OUR FINANCES. THE WORD USED HERE FOR ANXIOUS IS A VERB THAT CAN MEAN, ""TROUBLED WITH CARES"" OR ""SEEKING TO PROMOTE ONE'S INTERESTS.""THAT MEANS, ONE WHO IS AXIOUS ABOUT THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD HAVE BECOME SO FIXATED ON THEIR ISSUES IT BECOMES A HINDRANCE, A DISTRACTION AND HAVE HAD THEIR ATTENTION DRAWN AWAY FROM THE THINGS OF GOD. WHEN WE BECOME OVERLY FOCUSED ON SUCH SIMPLE THINGS AS FOOD AND CLOTHING WE START TO BECOME IMMOBILIZED TO THE POINT WHERE OUR TRUST IS DIVERTED FROM GOD TO OUR OWN ABILITIES TO PROVIDE FOR OURSELVES. WORRY PRESENTS US WITH THE DUAL TEMPTATION TO DISTRUST GOD AND TO SUBSTITUTE FEAR FOR PRACTICAL ACTION. WORRY MEANS PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT WE CANNOT CHANGE INSTEAD OF PUTTING OUR ENERGIES TO WORK IN EFFECTIVE WAYS."

Because there is something ""delicious"" ...offered in ... each bite. (Pause) Oscar Wilde said, ""The only way to get rid of temptation ...... is to .... give in to it."" We laugh about temptation ......and most of us do give in ......at one time .... or another. Sometimes it is only a 700-calorie piece of chocolate cake, .... which does not leave too severe ... a consequence. Other times the stakes are high .... and the consequences .... are indeed ... very painful. You would think that undesirable consequences ... would cause us ... to not break down .... To not give in, .... Yet we often fail .... over and over again. Beloved ...... Do Not Be Surprised by Temptation: If Satan had the gall to tempt the Son of God .... he will have no trouble .... in tempting you. (Long Pause) A man came to the theologian Charles Finney and said this: .... ""I don't believe in the existence of a devil."" ""Don't you?"" .... said Finney. ""Well, ... you resist him for a while, .... and you will believe."" (Pause) The Scriptures do not teach us .... that we will be temptation free ... after we come ... to the Lord.

Touched by this unusual display and deep emotions, with eyes glistening she slipped her arm around her husband. ""A penny for your thoughts,"" she said. ""It's amazing"" he replied. ""I just can't see how anybody can make a crib like that for only $46.50."" What's that saying? Some people can't see the forest for the trees. Sometimes when you concentrate on the details of a problem, you lose sight of the overall picture; in other words you focus on the unimportant, rather than on the important things. You miss the big picture. 2. Babies change our lives; bringing that newborn into your home changes everything; nothing will remain the same a. Joy and Love for an unknown person b. Responsibility 3. Some key babies in the bible made a great impact and were presented to God and dedicated to him - Isaiah 9.6 For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. 4. Baby Dedication Every church should rejoice in life's mile markers, starting with birth, as we dedicate our children to the Lord. This is a biblical practice. In the Old Testament, Hannah brought her boy, Samuel, to the temple. There she dedicated him to the Lord, saying, ""For this child I prayed, and the Lord has granted me my petition... I also have lent him to the Lord; as long as he lives he shall be lent to the Lord"" (1 Samuel 1:27-28). In the New Testament, Joseph and Mary did the same. In Luke 2:22-32, they brought Him to the temple in Jerusalem to consecrate Him to the Lord. When our Lord grew up and began His ministry, He was eager to bless the youngsters brought to Him. People even brought their infants and newborns to Jesus. ""And He took them up in His arms, laid His hands on them, and blessed them"" (Mark 10:16). When we bring our children before the Lord in church and dedicate them to Him, we're doing the same. It's an important celebration, for how greatly our children need Jesus, even from birth! The dedication of a child to Christ serves as a wonderful moment for a gathered church. The baby is formally introduced to the congregation, and the whole church joins in prayer for that child.

2 Corinthians 1:3-4,"('Pain', 'Ministry', 'Testimony')",Baptist," We've been talking about the steps associated with finding our freedom in Christ. We've used the word RECOVERY to speak about them: Realize I'm not God, that I'm powerless to control my tendency to do the wrong thing and my life is unmanageable. Earnestly believe that God exists, that I matter to Him and He has to power to help me recover. Consciously choose to commit all my life and will to Christ's care and control. Openly examine and confess my faults to myself, to God, and another person I trust. Voluntarily submit to every change God wants to make in my life and humbly ask Him to remove my character defects. Evaluate all my relationships, offer forgiveness to those who've hurt me and make amends for harm I've done to others, except when to do so would harm them or others. Reserve a daily time with God for self-examination, Bible reading and prayer in order to know God and His will for my life and gain the power to do His will for my life. As we wind up this series, I want to look at the last step. Y in the word RECOVERY stands for Yield - Yield myself to God to be used to bring this Good News to others by both my example and my words. As we wrap this up, I want to do two things: 1) why God allows pain in my life and 2) how can God use my pain to help others? 1. Why does God allow pain in my life? A. God has given me free will. You can choose good or bad, right or wrong, evil or life. God says you can reject me or accept me. It's your choice. Why? Because God desires a love relationship with us. And love is not love unless it's freely given. Free will is not only a blessing but it's also a burden because sometimes we make dumb choices. And those dumb choices can cause all kinds of painful consequences in our life. So it's good that I am free and I can choose but it's bad because I often choose the wrong thing and that causes pain in my life. I can choose to experiment with drugs. If I get addicted, it's my fault. I can choose to be sexually promiscuous, if I get a disease it's my fault. God says ""Yes, I would not like for you to have this pain, but it's part of the package that comes with the free will."" Not only does God give you a free will, He gives everyone else one too. Sometimes they don't do the right thing and you get hurt as an innocent victim. Those of you who have been hurt deeply by a parent, a former spouse, a teacher, a friend, a relative. God could have prevented that hurt from happening to you. All He would have had to do would be take away that person's free will to do wrong. But if He had done that, to be fair, He would have to have taken away your free will too. You see the dilemma? The problem is that by having a free will we get blessing, but we also get a burden. And God says, ""I'm not going to overrule your will."" God doesn't send anybody to Hell; you choose to go there by rejecting everything that He does. He says, ""I love you, I want you to be a part of my family."" If I say, ""Forget it God,"" thumb my nose, and walk out the other door, I can't blame anybody but myself. There is a free will."
Proverbs 19:21,"('Purpose In Life', 'Divine Purpose', 'Purpose For Life', 'Purpose Driven', 'What Is The Purpose Of Life')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Imagine God were to write a book about your life. With God as author, this biography would be totally truthful, accurately written. What sort of story would it be? Imagine God had a library of such books. Would He gladly place the volume bearing your name in a place of honours? Do you care what He thinks? Remember the two greatest days of your life are the day you were born, and the day you find out what your purpose is, but if you don't know what your purpose is then you don't know why you are here, and without purpose, life does not make sense. Human beings, no matter who they are or where they live, all want to be significant, superior, and successful.' This relentless pursuit has produced some spectacular invention in the history of human being. God who has the master plan of everything crafted every element in the universe to perform a specific function. Chief among all of God's creation are human beings who he made in his own likeness for his own purpose. We should all be positive about life because God created us all for a purpose; we are not accidents. Our greatest discovery in life is to discover our purpose and our greatest achievement is fulfilling it. Everything in life ""begins"" and ""ends"" with purpose. Everyone on this planet was born with and for a purpose. It is this purpose that is the only source of meaning and significant. Without purpose, life is an experiment or a chaotic journey that results in frustration, disappointment and failure. Without purpose, life is subjective, or it is a trial and error game that is ruled by environmental influences and the circumstances of the moment. Likewise, in the absence of purpose, time has no meaning, energy has no reason and life has no precision. Therefore, it is essential that we understand and discover our purpose in life so that we can experience an effective, full and rewarding life. ""The Purpose Driven Life"" book written by Rick Warren has sold over 35 million copies and is usually recommended as next to the Bible when it comes to Purpose Discovery. The book will help you see life from God's perspective rather than from human perspective. The book's 40 chapters are divided into six major sections, with the following titles: What on Earth Am I Here For? Purpose #1: You Were Planned for God's Pleasure (Worship) Purpose #2: You Were Formed for God's Family (Fellowship) Purpose #3: You Were Created to Become like His son (Discipleship) Purpose #4: You Were Shaped for Serving God (Ministry) Purpose #5: You Were Made for a Mission (Mission) Life is often defined by the questions we ask. The questions we are asking often reveal what we are thinking - or the direction we are going. Most people unfortunately never struggle to think about or find answers for the basic questions of existence, Origin, Purpose, Meaning and Destiny of life. The answers to these questions will consciously or unconsciously condition, empower or limit almost everything in that individual's life. The late Dr. Myles Munroe touched many lives through his teaching ministry and he taught that in discovering God's purpose, there are five basic questions we must have answers to:"
Acts 2:12-13,"('Pentecost', 'Disciples', 'New Wine', 'Tongues')",Baptist," July 1, 2013 By: Tom Lowe Series: The Early Church Lesson II.A.1.c: The Reaction: Mixed Acts 2.12, 13 (KJV) 12 And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this? 13 Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine. Commentary A crowd had gathered at the House where this very astounding event was taking place, and as they looked upon this astonishing thing: They were all amazed, because they saw men that appeared to be in a frenzy; a state of heavenly bliss who were speaking to the crowd about the wonderful things God had done and about Jesus Christ, and that He had risen from the grave. They did not know what to make of it, so they were confused as well as amazed, and they speculated that something wonderful may be happening. They hoped that on this Pentecost the kingdom of the Messiah might be introduced, since they had come to Jerusalem with that blessed event high in their expectations. They asked themselves and one another, ""What meaneth this?; could these men be messengers from heaven;"" and therefore, like Moses at the bush, they turned aside to see this great sight. The word rendered ""mocking"" means to quibble, to ridicule. It occurs in the New Testament in only one other place: Acts 17:32--""And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked."" This was an effect that was not confined to the day of Pentecost. There has been many a revival of religion, which has been a remarkable manifestation of the power of the Holy Spirit that has been an occasion for profane mockery and merriment. One characteristic of wicked men is to scoff at those things which are done to promote their own welfare. That's why the Saviour himself was mocked; and the efforts of Christians to save others have been the subject of ridicule. Scorn, and mockery, and a contemptuous shout, have been far more effective in discourage men from becoming Christians than any attempts at serious argument. God will treat men as they treat Him--""With the pure You will show Yourself pure; And with the devious You will show Yourself shrewd"" (Psalms 18:26; NKJV). The dealings of the Lord are always just. He metes out to every man according to his appraisal of them. And therefore he says to the wicked, ""Because I called and you refused, I extended my hand and no one took notice; I called, but you refused to listen; I held out my hand, but you paid no attention. But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: Because you disdained all my counsel, and my reproof you ignored--You did not follow my advice and did not listen when I corrected you. I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; I, in my turn, will laugh at your doom; I will mock when terror overtakes you"" (Proverbs 1:24-26; NAB). The crowd did not seem to understand what was taking place until someone said, ""They must be drunk."" The faction that held this opinion and began to disrespect the apostles was made up of the natives of Judea and Jerusalem, and probably the scribes, Pharisees, and chief priests, who always resisted the Holy Ghost. They said, These men are full of new wine, or sweet wine; they have drunk too much at this festival-time. It is not that they were illogical enough to think that wine that has gone to the head would enable men to speak languages which they never learned; but these men, who were native Jews, did not know, as the others did, that what was spoken was really the languages of other nations, and therefore, they took it to be gibberish and nonsense, such as drunkards sometimes talk. When they decided not to believe the words of Christ's messengers, they turned them off with this, ""These men are full of new wine."" The literal translation is sweet wine, and I understand that it is a little more intoxicating. They thought these men were drunk."
Galatians 6:11-18,"('Freedom', 'Cross', 'Hypocrisy', 'Acceptance In Christ')",Evangelical Free," Once upon a time an old man and his son were on their way to market. The old man was leading a donkey and the boy was walking behind when they went through the first village. There, the people called the old man a fool for not riding the donkey, so he climbed up on the animal's back. In the second village, the people said the old man was cruel to let the child walk while he enjoyed the ride, so the old man got off and put the boy on the donkey. In the third village, the people accused the boy of being lazy for making the old man walk, so the man got on the donkey with the boy. In the fourth village, the people felt sorry for the donkey, because he was made to carry two people, so when the old man and his son arrived at the market, the old man was seen carrying the donkey. Some people feel a need to impress others, but all they end up doing is carry a heavy burden. My dear friends, you can be free from the need to impress. You can be free from the pressure to perform. You can be free from worrying about what others think. You say, Phil, How? I want people to like me. I want people to respect me. How can I free myself from the burden of trying to impress at least some of the people in my life? Well, if you have your Bibles, I invite you to turn with me to Galatians 6, Galatians 6, where the Apostle Paul shows us how. Galatians 6:11 See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand. (ESV) The Apostle Paul usually dictated his letters to a secretary. Then, at the end of the letter, he would take the pen in his own hand and write a closing comment (1 Corinthians 16:21; Colossians 4:18; 2 Thessalonians 3:17). Usually it was a short comment - a verse or two - but here his closing comment is quite long - eight verses! Paul feels very strongly about what he is writing here. This is not just a mere formality tacked on at the end of a letter. This is important stuff! And just so we don't miss it, Paul says, ""See with what large letters I am writing."" Today, we would put it in bold print and double underline it. Well Paul, what's so important that you write this stuff in your own hand with such LARGE LETTERS? Galatians 6:12 It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh who would force you to be circumcised, and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. (ESV) You see, the cross was a cruel thing and terribly offensive, especially in polite company. In Jesus' day, crosses were reserved for the worst of criminals, the scum of society. It was a horrible instrument of torture and death, so horrible that Roman citizens, by law, could not be hung on them - only ""the Barbarians."" So when Christians began to proclaim that Christ had to die on a cross for our sins, many people were offended. ""What do you mean MY sin demands the penalty of the cross? I'm not that bad. How dare you suggest that I deserve crucifixion and that Christ had to pay that kind of penalty for my sin?"" That's the kind of reaction many people had to the preaching of the cross. The cross was very offensive, and because of it, many Christians found themselves hanging on them."

"1 Timothy 5:13, Matthew 25:24-25","('Dealing With Hurts', 'Overcoming Hurt', 'Reach To Others In Pain')",Assembly Of God," IT IS NEVER EASY TO WORKING WITH PEOPLE WITHOUT GOD'S PLAN? DEALING WITH HURT PEOPLE! By Wade Martin Hughes, Sr. Kyfingers@aol.com WE ACCEPT BURIED TALENTS AS THE NORM... TAKE OWNERSHIP... FIND A JOB FOR PEOPLE. WE NEED TO DEVELOP PEOPLE SKILLS. TEXT: 1 Timothy 5:13 And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not. Matthew 25:24 Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed: 25 And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine. WORKING WITH THE FAMILY, PEOPLE AND THE CHURCH OR REAL LIFE PEOPLE IS NEVER EASY. WE MUST FIND CREATIVE USE OF CONFLICT. AFTER WORKING WITH PEOPLE WE CAN ACCIDENTALLY FALL AND START WATCHING PEOPLE AND LISTENING TO THE NEGATIVISM AND BE DESTROYED. WE MUST IDENTIFY THIS PATH AND AVOID IT AT ALL COST. When one yields to the high calling of God we become very vulnerable to heartbreaks and distortions. To WORK WITH PEOPLE CAN BE a demanding role, almost like a mother and child. Then to work with others year after year is never easy. We must find JOY in what we do, because we see the rewards and fulfillment in being a servant of the Most High. We see, as we teach and work with people and the word, and while working with the great JOY, that in leading others in the things of God and in their personal development, we can find great satisfaction. WE MUST LEARN TO LOVE THE LITTLE THINGS IN LIFE. This is good, but this is the way the enemy will attack and come against us. Negative, heart breaking, disappointments in others --- then we question our self and lose our JOY in ministry. Then we head for the valley of tears, we doubt self, we doubt others, and we doubt God. God designed us to have a full JOY tank, then the enemy comes and puts his water in our tank and we find the PAIN of Ministry. God designed His ministers to be vulnerable. Exodus 4:3 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. 4 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand: God had Moses put down his rod and it turned into a snake. God said, Pick up the snake by the tail. Wait, we know any good snake handler picks up a snake from the back of the head. (TV dudes distort this, but they do it for a show, and have people you can't see near by to rescue them if needed.) Why God? Why must I pick up the snake? Why pick up a snake in an illogical way? Does God know the good rules of snake handling? SURE HE DOES! God was teaching Moses, you have to lean not to your own understanding but to the ways of God for effective ministry. God wanted to teach Moses that he would always be vulnerable and that Moses would have to depend on God to be his provider and waymaker and protector."
Romans 4:1-17,"('Faith', 'Grace', 'Holiness', ""Abraham's Faith"")",*other,omans 4:1-5; 13-17; Genesis 12:1-4; John 3:1-," Psalms 121 (Call to Worship) Title: Grace, Faith and the Walk of Holiness In our passages we see that 1. Our Spiritual Journey starts with GRACE 2. Our Spiritual Journey continues through FAITH 3. Our Spiritual Journey continues in a WALK OF PROGRESSIVE HOLINESS INTRO: Grace and peace from God our Father and from His Son Jesus Christ who came to take away the sin of the world. As you can quickly surmise, all of our passages this morning center on what it means to have a corporate and personal relationship with the LORD GOD ALMIGHTY? From these passages we should be able to answer some of the following questions: + How does one begin a relationship or a covenant with the LORD? +What is required to have an intimate and growing relationship with our LORD? +What does having a relationship with LORD accomplish in our lives and how we then live out our lives here on earth? These are just some of the questions that the Apostle Paul was doing his best to answer in his letter to the congregations in Rome. These are some of the questions that Nicodemus wanted Jesus to answer that night long ago when he came to talk to Jesus. They are good questions for us to look at this 2nd Sunday of Lent. These questions and their answers allow us to better understand the true nature of salvation and what is called genuine humanness and the life abundant and eternal. These questions and their answers remind us that justification, regeneration and sanctification all are gifts from our Heavenly Father and are not attained through personal achievement, self-disciple or through a series of good works. This morning, let's delve into these passages (especially Romans 4:1-17) and see the riches the LORD wants to share with us. I. Our spiritual journey begins with God's Grace Mankind's rescue and salvation story starts back in the Garden of Eden immediately following the Fall but this morning our Old Testament passage takes us to the 12th chapter of Genesis where we the story of the life of Abraham begins. The first 11 chapters of the book of Genesis is a compendium of stories about man's progressive slide towards wickedness that followed the Lord's wonderful gift of creation. Humanity seems to be on a freefall towards a state of compete degradation and disintegration. We start with the story of Adam and Eve's rebellion (Gen. 3), we go on to the story of Cain killing of Abel (Gen. 4), and then find ourselves in a world enslaved in sin ( 5-9) which leads of course to the divine judgment of the Great Flood. Given a fresh start we might expect the remaining two chapters to show us man's improvement but instead we see another series of declines that leads to the Lord confusing the languages so that man will not destroy himself and/or the world (10-11). It is into all of this chaos, degradation and wickedness that our story begins to takes a pivotal turn in chapter 12. Beginning with our Old Testament passage (12:1-4) the Biblical story goes from dealing with all of man's brokenness to a story of sharing the Good News - the story of how God is going to bring about rescue, salvation and restoration. Starting in chapter 12 we see the story of man's salvation which we must be careful to point out - begins not with us but with our LORD. It is God's initiative that begins our story of salvation."

Mark 1:21-28,"('Power', 'Deliverance', 'Authority Of Christ')",Baptist," Authority in the Synagogue Mark 1: 21-28 As we continue moving through the Gospel of Mark, bear in mind that he is writing primarily to a Roman audience, seeking to portray Jesus as the Servant of Men. It is a dialogue that moves rapidly from one event to the next. The fast pace, with which Mark wrote, skipped over several accounts and details that were recorded in Matthew and Luke. It is believed that the timeframe between Verse 13, following Jesus' temptation in the wilderness, and Verse 14, dealing with the imprisonment of John, is about a year. It is also believed that Jesus' popular Sermon on the Mount was delivered between Verses 20 and 21. This time period included Jesus' ministry in Nazareth, calling other disciples and being rejected of His own people. It doesn't appear that Mark sought to minimize those accounts, but for whatever reason, he chose not to include them in his Gospel. Our text picks up after a period of time following the call of Andrew, Peter, James, and John. Jesus is found within the synagogue at Capernaum, teaching the Word. Capernaum served as a home-base for Jesus' ministry. As He taught and ministered among the people that day, it quickly became evident that Jesus was no ordinary man. He spoke with authority and exercised power that captured the attention of those present within the synagogue. As we look in on that day of teaching, I want to examine the details of this encounter as we consider: Authority in the Synagogue. I. His Authority in the Scriptures (21-22) - These verses reveal the authority with which Jesus spoke as He expounded upon the Scriptures in the synagogue. Notice: A. His Passion (21) - And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught. We do know that some time has passed since the last details we have, but Mark reveals that when they came into Capernaum, Jesus immediately went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day. Now, some may argue that any good Jewish man would have been found in the synagogue on the Sabbath, but I am convinced this reveals the passion Jesus had for the Word and the house of God. We know, according to John's Gospel, that Jesus was the Word incarnate. He is the Living Word. Jesus is immediately found in the synagogue, teaching the Word, going about His Father's business. The example of Jesus ought to generate a hunger within the believer to study the Word of God and be found at the house of God. It isn't a burden, but a privilege. Our relationship with Christ alone should compel us to seek His Word and fellowship with His people at His house. B. Their Perception (22a) - And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes. As Jesus rose to teach, those present immediately noticed this man was unique. He wasn't like the others; He spoke with authority, having an intimate knowledge of doctrine. They were literally astonished - being struck with amazement and wonder. His teaching was not what they expected, but it certainly made an impact on those who heard Him!"
Acts 2:14-21,"('Holy Spirit', 'Pentecost', 'Peter', 'Holy Spirit General', 'Dream Dreams')",Baptist," July 1, 2013 By: Tom Lowe Series: The Early Church Title: Pentecost: The Fulfillment of Joel 2 Acts 2.14-21 (KJV) 14 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words: 15 For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day. 16 But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; 17 And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams: 18 And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy: 19 And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke: 20 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come: 21 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. Introduction The Spirit also filled the believers and empowered them for witness. He gave Peter insight into the Word and the ability to show men Christ in the Word. The Spirit used the witness of the church to convict the lost, just as Jesus said He would do--""But in fact, it is best for you that I go away, because if I don't, the Advocate won't come. If I do go away, then I will send him to you. And when he comes, he will convict the world of its sin, and of God's righteousness, and of the coming judgment. The world's sin is that it refuses to believe in me. Righteousness is available because I go to the Father, and you will see me no more"" (John 16:7-10; NLT). Commentary But Peter, We have here the beginning of the sermon which Peter preached on the day of Pentecost. He did not speak to those from other nations in a strange language (and we are not told how he replied to those that were amazed, and said, What meaneth this?), but to the Jews in the language of the ordinary people, even to those that mocked them and claimed the apostles were drunk with wine. Peter was bold, rash, and passionate; and he rose now to defend the apostles of Jesus Christ, and Christ himself, from an injurious charge. He was not intimidated by ridicule or opposition; he felt that now was the right time for preaching the gospel to the crowd that had been assembled by curiosity. No ridicule should deter Christians from an honest declaration of their opinions, and a defense of the operations of the Holy Spirit. He begins the sermon by dealing with this accusation (v. 15), and so he addresses his sermon to the men of Judea and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. During Peter's discourse, we have good reason to think that the other disciples continued to speak to those who understood them (and therefore flocked about them) in the languages of their respective countries, and their topic was the wonderful works of God. For that reason, we know that the three thousand souls converted, and added to the church on that day were not responding to Peter's preaching only, but rather to the preaching of all, or most, of the hundred and twenty. But the Holy Spirit chose to record only Peter's sermon as evidence for him that he was completely recovered from his fall, and thoroughly restored to the divine favor and fellowship. The man that had cowardly denied Christ now has courageously confessed him to be Lord and Messiah!"""
Matthew 26:36-46,"('Prayer', 'Solitude', 'Spiritual Discipline', 'Garden Of Gethsemane')",Christian/Church Of Christ," SOLITUDINAL INTERVENTION MATTHEW 26:36-46 #SpiritualDisciplines JOURNEY THROUGH THE SCRIPTURES As we begin this morning, I want us to take a journey through the Scriptures in the life of Jesus. Jesus Christ demonstrates, by His own life and example, the spiritual discipline we will dig into today. We are talking about the spiritual discipline of solitude and Jesus is a wonderful example for us with this aspect of the Christian life. Mark chapter 1 describes the beginning of Jesus' ministry: READ MARK 1:35-38 (ALSO FOUND IN LUKE 4:42-44) 35 Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed. 36 Simon and his companions went to look for him, 37 and when they found him, they exclaimed: ""Everyone is looking for you!""38 Jesus replied, ""Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby villages--so I can preach there also. That is why I have come."" As we look at this passage, it seems quite clear that Jesus spent time by Himself to prepare Himself for preaching, teaching, healing, and facing His ministry which was so very important. The Gospel of Luke Chapter 5 continues to show us that Jesus used solitary times in His life. As Jesus taught and healed people, the size of the crowds grew and I can imagine so did the amount of effort and stress in His life. Luke 5 says: READ LUKE 5:15-16 15 Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses. 16 But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed. The next passage, Mark 6, shows us that Jesus had a normal habit of getting by Himself. He did take time by Himself, but He also was trying to teach His disciples to do the same. He was trying to instill in them the need for solitary times in their lives: READ MARK 6:30-32 30 The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught. 31 Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, ""Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest."" 32 So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place. One of the next times in Jesus' life where we see Him taking time for Himself is when heart hurting tragedy strikes. Jesus had family that we know of: His mother, brothers and sisters, and a cousin. His cousin was John the Baptist was the first prophet in Israel in 400 years and was the Herald of the Messiah. John baptized Jesus. John pointed people to Jesus. John preached about Jesus. John was beheaded in prison. Matthew 14 shares with us: READ MATTHEW 14:11-13 11 His head was brought in on a platter and given to the girl, who carried it to her mother. 12 John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. 13 When Jesus heard what had happened, he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. Our journey in the Scriptures now arrives at Matthew 26 and is a key point in Jesus' life. To be honest with you, it is a key point in our lives and means a great deal to us whether or not we realize it. It is a key point in our lives because Matthew 26 begins the account for us of the rapid succession of events that led Jesus to the cross."
Luke 12:13-21,"('Contentment', 'Simplicity')",Christian/Church Of Christ," SIMPLE SAM AND HEAPIN HARV LUKE 12:13-21 #SpiritualDisciplines INTRODUCTION I want to introduce you to two people this morning. They are two people who approach life in very different ways when it comes to money, material things, and financial habits. First, we have Simple Sam (it can be Simple Samantha if you like!). Simple Sam is a guy who makes a conscious effort to be the same on the inside as he is on the outside. His speech is truthful and honest and he makes decisions based off of faith and thinking. He finds security in his faith and loves the things of God that he is blessed with and those are the things make him happy. He manages his money and does not let his money manage him. He never stresses over money. He has everything in his life he needs and more. Second, we have Heapin Harv (it can be Heapin Henrietta if you like!). Heapin Harv is a guy who makes no effort to be the same on the inside and the outside. He flip flops often in what he says and what he wants and his opinions seem to change with the blowing winds. He makes decisions based on feelings. He finds his security in material things and calls covetousness ambition, calls hoarding prudence, and calls greed industry. He wants nice things to make him happy. He is always a slave to money and has many bills. He stresses and worries over money. He never seems to be content with anything. QUESTION: Are you Simple Sam or Heapin Harv? READ LUKE 12:13-21 13 Someone in the crowd said to him, ""Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.""14 Jesus replied, ""Man, who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?"" 15 Then he said to them, ""Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions."" 16 And he told them this parable: ""The ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest. 17 He thought to himself, 'What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.'18 ""Then he said, 'This is what I'll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain. 19 And I'll say to myself, ""You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.""' 20 ""But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?' 21 ""This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God."" THE SITUATION IN LUKE 12:13-21 The parable that Jesus gives in Luke 12:13-21 is one that comes because of an issue that arrises between brothers. The brothers apparently have lost their parents and have an inheritance coming their way. One brother is keeping the inheritance. One brother wants his cut. They are arguing. Probably when they are not arguing they are not speaking. What has overtaken each of them is desire. The desire for stuff. The desire for money. The desire to have and to hold. The desire to have financial security. If you take a child, even a very young child into Toys R Us or Walmart, you will not have to teach the child what to do. Hours of training by TV and movies and even by parents have taught a child that there is no higher calling than desire. Now what does that tell us? It is as if greed and the desire for material things comes quite naturally, but it is also true that our society has become a vast supermarket where we are trained in desire. We live in a world of manufactured need. Advertising on TV, billboards, and the internet creates, molds, kindles desire."
Luke 14:25-33,"('Sacrifice', 'Commitment', 'Discipleship', 'Commitment To Christ')",Christian/Church Of Christ," PICCADILLY DISCIPLES LUKE 14:25-33 ILLUSTRATION: PICCADILLY 1 Imagine if you will a place to eat where you can have almost anything under the sun and where you serve yourself. You walk in, grab a tray, and laid out before you are more options than you could eat at any one time. The point of this place is options options options. Each option costs as you fill up your tray. You can have ham and turkey. You can hold the gravy or get 2 kinds of gravy. You can get a salad or just sliced tomatoes. You can get the special of the day or make your own meal. You have a choice between red, blue, green jello which for some reason seems to be a specialty in almost all of these kinds of places. Not only that there seems to be 6 different kinds of pudding in little cups. Each item costs and so as you add each item to your tray the cost of your meal goes up. After going through the whole line, the items are added up and you pay for your meal. Once you sit down, there is no waiters or waitresses usually. You just eat and leave. This kind of place is called a cafeteria. There were several famous chains of cafeterias in America. Morrison's and Piccadilly were perhaps the most famous. Luby's was also quite popular. They are not around so much anymore so it is likely that you have not been to a restaurant called a 'cafeteria' in some time. We will come back to cafeterias in a minute. INTRODUCTION The teachings of Jesus are not for the faint of heart. Some of the points that Jesus makes are quite controversial. They are controversial because they shock us. They are controversial because they are at times opposite of what we want to do. They are controversial because they seem upside down to us in our expectations of God. Jesus presents ideas and makes statements that would have made those listening quite uncomfortable... and to be honest... make us quite uncomfortable as well. For example, He said... ""But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca, 'is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell."" (Matthew 5:22) ""Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you."" (Matthew 5:44, Luke 6:27) ""If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also."" (Matthew 5:39) ""I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you."" (John 6:53) Many times we reflect on some of the teachings of Jesus and we question... ""What!?"" We also think, ""that doesn't make sense."" And most commonly and truthfully we say, ""I don't want to do that."" The seemingly upside down passage that we will look at today also gives us the same thoughts. In Jesus' day, many people wanted to follow Jesus, especially in the middle of His ministry. Jesus was gaining popularity and was doing miracles and news was spreading about Him and people wanted to be a disciple of Jesus. He was the ""it"" thing going on. Large crowds would follow Jesus from town to town to listen and see what He would do next. People were asking what it took to be a disciple of Jesus. People are still asking that same question! I hope you are asking that question! And to be honest, the answer is not one that we like. And to be even more honest, most of us are not willing to do what He says. The answer is as controversial and uncomfortable as turning the other cheek and loving people who hate us. What does He say?"
Isaiah 58:1-14,"('Compassion', ""Jesus' Compassion"", 'Fasting', 'Fasting And Prayer')",Christian/Church Of Christ," BREAK FORTH LIKE THE DAWN ISAIAH 58:1-14 #SPIRITUALDISCIPLINES INTRODUCTION... http://conditioningresearch.blogspot.com/2010/07/intermittent-fasting-joke.html There was a man who went into see his doctor. He was overweight and the doctor wanted to see if fasting would produce any results for him. ""I want you to eat regularly for 2 days, skip a day, and then repeat that for 2 weeks. Eat for 2 days, skip a day, and then repeat. The next time I see you, you should have lost about 5 pounds and gotten control of your appetite. After 2 weeks, the man returned to his doctor and he had lost nearly 60 pounds! The doctor was utterly astonished. ""That is amazing, did you follow my instructions?"" ""I did,"" the man said, ""but I thought I was going to drop dead on that third day."" ""From the hunger you mean?"" the doctor asked. ""No, all the skipping around!"" This morning we are going to dig into the subject of fasting. What is ""fasting?"" That might be a word that you have heard before, but really don't know anything about it. You probably have fasted before getting blood drawn or having surgery, but when we speak about fasting in a spiritual context, it is the same, but a little bit different. ""Fasting"" is when we ""abstain in some significant way from food and possibly drink as well"" (Willard pg. 166). More specifically, in the Bible, ""fasting refers to abstaining from food for spiritual purposes"" (Foster pg. 48). It is that last part, the purpose, which sets Christian fasting apart from hunger strikes, dieting, or not eating before surgery which could all be called fasts. There is a great spiritual purpose behind fasting for the believer in Christ and there are great benefits. Before we get a little further, I want to mention what ""fasting"" is not. Fasting is not deciding to skip TV for awhile. Fasting is not deciding not to log into Facebook or Twitter or use the internet for an extended period of time. Fasting is not skipping shopping, listening to music, not being critical, or skipping hot showers. I am so sorry, but fasting is tied to the physical body and the spirit and is a discipline that connects those two parts of us. Removing TV or music or computers from our lives is not specifically the same thing. In order to frame fasting for us, I want us to read from Isaiah 58 which has much to say about proper fasting before God. I selected this passage long ago and realized as I was digging deeper into it that Isaiah 58 is rich with so much meaning. Let's read Isaiah 58 today in three sections and discover God's truths for us about fasting. I. UNDERSTANDING (verses 1-5) READ ISAIAH 58:1-5 ""Shout it aloud, do not hold back. Raise your voice like a trumpet. Declare to my people their rebellion and to the descendants of Jacob their sins. 2 For day after day they seek me out; they seem eager to know my ways, as if they were a nation that does what is right and has not forsaken the commands of its God. They ask me for just decisions and seem eager for God to come near them. 3 'Why have we fasted,' they say, 'and you have not seen it? Why have we humbled ourselves, and you have not noticed?'. ""Yet on the day of your fasting, you do as you please and exploit all your workers. 4 Your fasting ends in quarreling and strife, and in striking each other with wicked fists. You cannot fast as you do today and expect your voice to be heard on high. 5 Is this the kind of fast I have chosen, only a day for people to humble themselves? Is it only for bowing one's head like a reed and for lying in sackcloth and ashes? Is that what you call a fast, a day acceptable to the Lord?"""
Romans 5:12-19,"('Adam', ""God's Grace"", 'Original Sin', ""God's Law"", 'Sin General')",Anglican," The reading from Romans 5:12-19 reinforces the idea that those who trust Christ have hope for the future. Let me explain. Adam's sin led to condemnation of the entire human race because his sinful nature was passed on to all of his descendants. Christ overcame that condemnation. As a result, everyone who believes in Christ has been saved and forgiven and can look forward to spending eternity with Him in heaven. The doctrine of solidarity says that all humanity is under the leadership of two men: Adam and Christ. Connection with Adam leads to death. Satan was the original angel who violated the righteousness of God, but sin entered the world through Adam, and death entered the world through sin. Even though there was no law, death was universal because people were still sinful. They died because they inherited the nature of death from Adam, not because of their sinful acts. Because of Adam's sin, humanity was introduced to death-not physical death, because Adam lived for many years after that fateful day in the Garden of Eden. The type of death that was introduced was spiritual death, also known as separation from God. Connection with Christ leads to life. Christ in His obedience corrected the wrong Adam did in his disobedience. He secured our eternal home and glory. He conquered the last enemy-death. That victory has given me strength in the days since my mother's death. Christ is not Adam's successor but his Saviour. They are alike only in the sense that both had universal significance: Adam for death, Christ for life. The key is much more. Whatever humankind has inherited from Adam, they have much more in Christ. Christ's one act of salvation was far superior to Adam's one act of rebellion. One commentator noted that ""That one single misdeed should be answered by judgment, this is perfectly understandable: that the accumulated sins and guilt of all the ages should be answered by God's free gift, this is the miracle of miracles."" Christ's obedience is greater than Adam's disobedience. Adam was in an environment that was conducive to obedience (the Garden), but he disobeyed and brought death. Jesus was the second Adam. He was in an environment that hindered obedience (the fallen world), but He obeyed God and brought life. We don't deserve God's grace. It is his undeserved favour for us. It is a gift that was paid for by Christ's death and resurrection. Some people refuse to accept this gift because of pride. If they accept it, they realize their despair, and most people aren't keen on doing that. Some people also think that they can earn this gift by their own efforts and deeds. We can't earn our way to heaven, because as I mentioned a minute ago it is a free ticket that Christ paid for. So how did He pay for this gift? He did it through two types of obedience to God. First, he actively fulfilled all of the requirements of God's Law. He never failed, and he kept and fulfilled all of the Law's requirements perfectly at all times. He presented to God a full and complete righteousness that was without stain or fault, just like all of the animals that were used for Old Testament sacrifices were without stain or fault. His righteousness is the ground on which God is willing to accept us."
Genesis 2:15-3:7,"('Original Sin', ""Adam's Sin"", ""Buyer's Remorse"", 'Adam Is Sin', 'Christ Gives Life')",Anglican," Have you ever experienced buyer's remorse? Just before we buy something major like a car or a house we feel the surge of excitement that comes with getting something new. It's the same feeling a child has when he or she gets a new toy for their birthday or for Christmas. After we buy the item, sometimes we are hit by a wave of remorse. We ask ourselves if we really needed the item or if we should have spent the money. Buyer's remorse is nothing new. In fact, the first instance of buyer's remorse is in the reading we heard from Genesis earlier in today's service. It began with the crafty serpent and his sales pitch. He was also the first example of a salesman who sold ""snake oil."" Sin is a mystery. It arises from within God's ""good"" creation. The serpent is one of God's creatures. Human suspicion about God's motivations was embedded within human hearts from the beginning of time. It merely needed the serpent's encouragement to bring it out and convert it into action. Obedience is at the core of all that God wants for and from his children. In Eden, God didn't ask Adam and Eve for love or faithfulness, only for obedience to one fundamental command: ""If you want to walk with Me, do what I say."" God has set boundaries for us. They are like painted markings on a highway. Without those markings to give directions, there would be confusion and accidents. We are surrounded by a world where people live by their own moral codes and defy God's boundaries. These people don't have any peace or sense of security that moral guidelines provide. The serpent tried to make God's command not to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil sound more restrictive than it really was. The serpent tried to get Eve to question God's character and motives for herself. In her reply, Eve twisted God's prohibition. She left out the words ""surely"" and ""every""- ""surely,"" because God said so, and ""every,"" because of God's generosity. She also added to God's prohibition, ""Neither shall you touch it."" Where did that come from? Was it an exaggeration, or was it something she and/or Adam added to build an extra wall of protection between themselves and the tree? There is a danger in adding to or taking away anything from God's Word. Any alteration changes the meaning. All we have to do is look at the Pharisees and their 613 rules to see what happens when God's Word is changed by man. Doubt led to disobedience, and the world has suffered the consequences ever since that fateful day. When we turn our back on God's Word, we turn our backs on God's world. Evil appealed to false pride, and this false pride replaced God with the self. The inflated sense of importance overshadowed God and others. It made man the centre of creation. Pride is at the root of many temptations. All of us suffer from temptation. We become victim to it, and therefore all of us sin. David Boyd commented on Mar 3, 2017 The one sentence at the end ""listen for the invitation to take and eat the bread of life"" does not make this a sermon about Communion. Please remove that tag, so that a search for ""Communion"" doesn't give this sermon as a result!

"Exodus 17:8-16, Isaiah 59:19","('Banner', 'Name Of Jesus')",Assembly Of God," JEHOVAH-NISSI Isa. 59:19, Ex. 17:15 INTRODUCTION A. HUMOR 1. A pastor had a little kitten stuck up in a tree. The tree was not sturdy enough to climb so the pastor decided that if he tied a rope to his car and drove until the tree bent down, he could then reach up and get the kitten. 2. But as he moved just a little too far, the rope broke. The tree snapped upright and the kitten instantly sailed through the air and out of sight. 3. He felt terrible, but finally prayed, ""Lord, I commit this kitten to Your keeping,"" and then went about his business. 4. A few days later he was at the grocery store and met one of his church members. In her shopping cart he was amazed to see cat food. She was a CAT HATER, so he asked her why she was buying cat food. 5. She replied, ""You won't believe this but I've refused to get my little girl a cat even though she'd begged for one. I told her, ""If God gives you a cat, I'll let you keep it."" 6. ""I watched her walk straight out into the yard, get on her knees and ask God for a cat. And Pastor, you won't believe what I saw with my own eyes; God dropped a kitten right down in front of her! What could I say?"" B. SIGNIFICANCE OF FLAGS 1. FLAG BURNING, is an emotionally charged issue. How do you feel when you're watching TV and see someone burning the U.S. flag? Is it really a ""constitutional right?"" 2. HISTORY OF. The flag standard is highly prized in war. In ancient times the names of special victories were written, engraved in it. It was the last disgrace to lose the standard. In many battles, men have fallen in heaps around the standard attempting to preserve it. C. TEXTS ""When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him"" Isa. 59:19 KJV. 8 The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim. 9 Moses said to Joshua, ""Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hands."" 10 So Joshua fought the Amalekites as Moses had ordered, and Moses, Aaron and Hur went to the top of the hill. 11 As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning. 12 When Moses' hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up--one on one side, one on the other--so that his hands remained steady till sunset. 13 So Joshua overcame the Amalekite army with the sword. 14 Then the Lord said to Moses, ""Write this on a scroll as something to be remembered and make sure that Joshua hears it, because I will completely blot out the name of Amalek from under heaven."" 15 Moses built an altar and called it The Lord is my Banner. 16 He said, ""Because hands were lifted up against the throne of the Lord, the Lord will be at war against the Amalekites from generation to generation."" Ex. 17:8-16 C. THESIS 1. We're going to look 3 aspects of the Banner of the Lord; as a Banner of Resistance, as a Rallying Point, and as representing Jesus Himself and how we can wield His name to get the victory over the forces of hell."
James 3:13-18,"('James', 'Godly Wisdom', 'Practical Living', 'Wisdom And Understanding')",Baptist," PRACTICAL CHRISTIAN LIVING #7 Godly Wisdom and Spiritual Maturity James 3:13 Who is wise and has understanding among you? He should show his works by good conduct with wisdom's gentleness. 14 But if you have bitter envy and selfish ambition in your heart, don't brag and deny the truth. 15 Such wisdom does not come from above but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic. 16 For where envy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every kind of evil. 17 But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, compliant, full of mercy and good fruits, without favoritism and hypocrisy. 18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who cultivate peace. INTRO: This morning we will continue in this series through the Book of James on Practical Christian Living. The Book of James was written to help us understand our relationship with God, and our relationship with each other better; to help us attain spiritual maturity; and to teach us how to live out our Christian faith. Let's review what we've learned so far in this series: In week 1 we learned who James was, whom his letter was written to, the purpose it was written, and the importance of this teaching. In week 2 we learned that our faith will be tested, how to overcome trials, and how to transform the trials of life into triumphs. In week 3 we learned that God calls us to be doers of His Word and not merely hearers - the blessing comes from the doing, not the hearing. In week 4 we were warned about the destructive sin of favoritism, prejudice, racism - we learned how God is not partial, and we learned how a Christian should properly relate to others who are different from us. We learned to recognize that although we may look differently, or come from different places, or belong to different socio-economic groups, we are all ONE in the Body of Christ In week 5, we learned that faith and works go hand in hand. A faith that does not produce the work of Christ within us, is no faith at all. Real faith will always produce the work of Christ. Our faith must be demonstrated through our works. Last week, we learned that God expects His people to control the use of our tongues. We looked at some of the most common ways in which we abuse the gift of speech. We also learned the proper way that God expects us to use our words in a positive manner. This is an extremely important issue that we must get right. If you weren't here last week, I encourage you to go to our Facebook page or website and watch this message. Not only to watch it, but allow the Holy Spirit speak to you through the message as you are watching. As we continue to move forward through this series, this morning we will ask and answer 3 important questions: 1) What is true wisdom and where does it comes from? 2) What are the problems created by a lack of wisdom? and, 3) What will true wisdom produce in our lives? One powerful truth that I want you to get from today's message, is that True Wisdom and Spiritual Maturity go hand in hand. You can't have one without the other. In fact, as we will see through the course of today's message, Spiritual Maturity is the one true sign that a person has received and is walking in the true wisdom of God. You can't reach Spiritually maturity without True Godly wisdom. And, only true wisdom produces maturity, which in turn effects every aspect of our life, from our thought process to our outward actions, including our speech."
Acts 2:22-36,"('Holy Spirit', 'Pentecost', 'Holy  Spirit')",Baptist," July 15, 2013 By: Tom Lowe Lesson II.A.2.b: Pentecost: Based Upon Christ's Work Acts 2.22-36 (KJV) 22 Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: 23 Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain: 24 Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it. 25 For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved: 26 Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope: 27 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. 28 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance. 29 Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. 30 Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; 31 He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption. 32 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. 33 Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear. 34 For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 35 Until I make thy foes thy footstool. 36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ. Introduction Having concluded his remarks concerning the gift of the Holy Ghost, Peter preaches to them about Jesus: and this passage is a summary of the history of Christ. Here is an account of his death and sufferings, which they witnessed just a few weeks earlier. His death is considered an instance of God's wonderful grace and wisdom. In this sacrifice, Divine justice was satisfied, God and man brought together again, and Christ himself glorified, according to an eternal counsel, which could not be changed. But, as for the peoples role in this; it was an act of awful sin and foolishness. Christ's resurrection did away with the reproach of his death; this was Peter's main topic. Christ was God's Holy One, sanctified and set apart to His service in the work of redemption. His death and sufferings were not for Him only, but for all His, and it gave them entrance into an eternal blessed life. This event had taken place as foretold, and the apostles were witnesses. But the resurrection did not rest upon this alone; Christ had poured upon his disciples the miraculous gifts and Divine influences, of which the crowd had witnessed the effects. Through the Saviour, we know the way to a better life; and we are encouraged to expect God's presence and His blessings forever. All this springs from certain belief that Jesus is the Lord, and the anointed Saviour."
2 Peter 1:5-8,"('Repentance', 'Value System')",Christian Missionary Alliance," Core Training 2 Peter 1:5-8 1/8/17 INTRODUCTION Core training has become a fitness buzzword. A muscular and well-defined core shows both strength and health. Striving to have a good core is a part of most work out programs. Abdominals, Obliques, Intercostals, Core Values Core values are the fundamental beliefs of a person or organization. ... Core values can help people to know what is right from wrong; they can help organizations to determine if they are on the right path and fulfilling their goals; and they create an unwavering and unchanging guide. Those values we hold which form the foundation on which we perform work and conduct ourselves. AT THE CMACHURCH WE BELIEVE THAT SEVERAL CORE VALUES HELP THAT DEFINE OUR BEING IN CHRIST. These are the things that we expect to see rub off on others, the things we expected to be polished in us in our journey together with Jesus. In last year's annual message, we identified them as these 6 things I. cmaChurch core Values ACTS 1:8 Family A. Divine Intimacy We value people going deep in a real and thriving relationship God through Jesus Christ. We go out of our way to challenge people to drink deep of the water of life, to be every changed, constantly discovering more and more in their Journey with Jesus. This intimacy is discovered through the study of his word and by experiencing the power of prayer. B. Active Repentance We value active repentance. Sin is big deal. Jesus died not just to forgive us our sins, but to free us from sin. We value a lifestyle in which repentance leads to freedom from our past. Stories of people turning from sin and embracing new streams of grace are treasured. C. H.S. Dependency We value the indwelling presence and work of the Holy Spirit. The life we are called to live, the purpose we are destined to pursue is not possible without his transforming work in our lives. Without His presence and power in our lives we will never fulfill our calling and purpose. D. Total Life Stewardship God has a lien on every aspect of who we are, not just our finances, but time, our relationships, our commitments, our possessions, our resources, our families. Everything we have, everything we are is his. We value a life style which total life stewardship is characterized. E. Passionate Purpose As an Acts 1:8 family we recognize that each of us is designed by god to fulfill specific roles and purposes. We value a lifestyle where those callings are pursued with passion. Those passions are a lifelong pursuit, not merely the dreams of the young, but also the lifeblood of the seniors in our midst. F. Genuine Relationships As an Acts 1:8 family we value real, authentic relationships--relationships that are developed over time and treasured for a life time. The development of such relationship exists as an ongoing priority in our lives. As we begin this year, once again we're going to look at the core values of following Jesus which we hope are more and more reflected in our experience as the cmaChurch. Why? II. Why teach on core values?"
John 17:1-3,"('Love Of God', 'Value System', 'Divine Intimacy')",Christian Missionary Alliance," Divine Intimacy 1/15/17 John 17:1-3 INTRODUCTION What's on your wish list? Buzzfeed regularly makes some suggestions for items to add to your wish list on Amazon. Here is some of their recent top suggestions. Rainbow projector A Peanut butter cake mix for your dog's next birthday A gift basket with throwback candies form the 1960's A yodeling Pickle? Bacon Bandages? T.S. Wish list. Items. We laugh at some of those but each of us probably has things on our wish list, our hope list, our desire list that are so significant that we pray for them. Some of us have prayed for a spouse, for children, for jobs for wisdom, for healing, for strength, for renewal. For many of us the top items on our wish list can be discerned by simply examining our prayer list. There is an account in scripture late in Jesus ministry when we get a clear picture of what is on the top of the forgivers wish list, the things that he desires so much that he it become the first thing that he prays for. Turn with me to John 17:1-3 Chapters 14-17 of the Gospel of John are known as the Farewell Discourse given by Jesus to eleven of his disciples immediately after the conclusion of the Last Supper in Jerusalem, the night before his crucifixion. The discourse is generally seen as having distinct components First, Jesus tells the disciples that he will be going away to the Father, that he will send the Holy Spirit to guide the disciples. The next part of the discourse contains the allegory of The Vine which positions Jesus as the vine (the source of life for the world) and the disciples as the branches. The section ends with a warning/promise. ""I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world."" John 16:33 In the final part of the discourse (John 17:1-26) Jesus prays for his followers and the coming Church. This is the longest prayer of Jesus in any of the gospels, and is known as the Farewell Prayer or the High Priestly Prayer. The Forgiver's life is now measured in hours and we can assume that what he prays for is of the highest importance and significance. .John 17:1-3 17 When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, ""Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you, 2 since you have given him authority over all flesh, to give eternal life to all whom you have given him. 3 And this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. RECOGNIZING JESUS DESIRE, THE PURSUIT OF DIVINE INTIMACY SHOULD DEFINE US. I. What do we mean be divine intimacy? For me to live is Christ to die is gain. I currently have 1,198 friends on facebook. 5,000 friends on Facebook? Scientists prove 150 is the most we can cope with. www.dailymail.co.uk A. Divine Intimacy and Eternal Life are tantamount, synonymous, equal. 3 And this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. Divine Intimacy means experiencing the presence of God in a knowable way, definable relational way. It is the key characteristic of life now and life to come."
Matthew 3:8,"('Repentance', 'Value System')",Christian Missionary Alliance," Active Repentance 1/22/17 Matt 3:8 INTRODUCTION The Definition Matters Words change meaning over time in ways that might surprise you. Here are just a few examples of words (so, preacher, take your choice) you may not have realized didn't always mean what they mean today. Nice: This word used to mean ""silly, foolish, simple."" Far from the compliment it is today! Silly: Meanwhile, silly went in the opposite direction: in its earliest uses, it referred to things worthy or blessed; from there it came to refer to the weak and vulnerable, and more recently to those who are foolish. Awful: Awful things used to be ""worthy of awe"" for a variety of reasons, which is how we get expressions like ""the awful majesty of God."" Naughty: Long ago, if you were naughty, you had naught or nothing. Then it came to mean evil or immoral, and now you are just badly behaved. Repentance: At one time the word simply mean to rethink or reweigh. Others said it meant ""to feel regret."" To affect (oneself) with contrition or regret for something done, etc Others said that it was originally associated with a greek or latin military phrase meaning ""to turn away."" In the New Testament, the word metanoia is often translated as ""repentance"". But this kind of repentance is not about regret or guilt or shame; it implies making a decision to turn around, to face a new direction. T.S. Repentance is key in understanding the kingdom of God. It is one of the first messages of the Forgiver. Matthew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, ""Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."" In the mind of the forgiver repentance is directly associated with experience the kingdom of heaven. RECOGNIZING JESUS' EMPHASIS, ACTIVE REPENTANCE SHOULD BECOME A DEFINING VALUE I. Repentance -- Defined A conscious lifestyle decision to turn to God (a turning that goes beyond sorrow and contrition) triggered by the work of the Holy Spirit, possible only because of the work of Grace. A. Volitional -- It is a decision. A response. A choice we make as a result of wanting the relationship with Jesus. It may be accompanied by emotions but at the core it a whole heart decision. From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say , ""Repent : for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."" B. Evidential of or providing evidence. ""the evidential value of the record"" Lifestyle decisions and changes that are the outcome of the work of Grace in us. We are transformed into the image of Jesus. We bear the family characteristics of our heavenly father. Repentance about a changing lifestyle, prescribed or formulaic rituals. Acts 11:18 And they glorified God, saying, ""Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life."" ESV II. Active Repentance A. Marks the first steps in our journey with Jesus. Matt 9:9-13 9 As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. ""Follow me,"" he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him. 10 While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house, many tax collectors and ""sinners"" came and ate with him and his disciples. 11 When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, ""Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"""
Colossians 3:17,"('Stewardship', 'Value System', 'Stewardship Of Life')",Christian Missionary Alliance," Whole Life Stewardship 2/12/17 Colossians 3:17 INTRODUCTION Many of us, when we hear the word stewardship, instantly become uncomfortable. We hide that discomfort behind joke and cartoons. Here are couple. Our discomfort and our assumption that a sermon on stewardship is sermon on tithing could prevent us from talking about another value the we truly hope becomes a part of your life at the cmaChurch --whole life stewardship--a wrestling with what it means that Jesus is lord of all. In June, of 2012 U2 frontman Bono made ripples across evangelical America with an interview with Focus on the Family's Jim Daly. In the interview Bono affirmed his Christian faith, reciting a stream of biblical quotes along with his own commentary and applications to daily life. At one point he clearly stated, ""I believe that Jesus was the Son of God."" In the midst of his this interview he also championed a few global causes, including the idea that world hunger could be eliminated now, Aids could be stopped in Africa and that the tide could be turned on poverty. Bono affirmed this God Scale of the vision and stated: You're absolutely right; it's a much grander vision. ... We have a pastor who said to us, ""Stop asking God to bless what you're doing, Bono."" ... He said, ""Find out what God is doing, 'cause it's already blessed."" ... When you align yourself with God's purpose as described in the Scriptures, something special happens to your life. I submit that Bono's journey with Jesus has opened the door to his embracing whole life stewardship. Anne Rathbone Bradley, PhD is Vice President of Economic Initiatives at the Institute for Faith, Work & Economics, refers to this as ""our call to greatness."" T.S. In on one of his practical exhortations to the Churches in Colossae, a city in Asia Minor, Paul concludes his charge with summary charge. Listen to the entire exhortation. Col 3:12-17 12 Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, 13 bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. 14 And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. 15 And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body. And be thankful. 16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God. 17 And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. ESV Jesus had done a similar thing for his disciples. At the end of a lengthy exhortation, he summed everything up in a simple summary charge. Matt 6:25-33 25 ""Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? 26 Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? 27 And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? 28 And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, 29 yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 30 But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? 31 Therefore do not be anxious, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' 32 For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. 33 But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."
Acts 16:16-34,"('Salvation', 'Gospel', 'Free Gift', 'Are You Saved')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Everyone knows this is an important question-- How to be saved is the most important quest of any human life. This quest begins when a man or woman first realizes their true state before a holy God. The Apostle Paul and Silas had been carrying the Gospel to Europe. In Macedonia they went to Philippi, a great city and a Roman colony, and they went and met by the riverside with some women who were meeting there to pray. On their way, they met a girl who was demon-possessed. Paul said to the demon in the girl, ""Come out of her."" And the demon came out. The evil men who controlled the girl became angry, because she had been telling future events and they were making money on her fortune-telling. The men took Paul and Silas to the magistrates, who had them beaten and thrown into jail and put in bonds. In that prison they experienced the great grace of God. They received everything they needed transform a prison of pain into a prison of praise. Instead of moaning and groaning in jail, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners heard them. All of a sudden, an earthquake shook the whole prison. The doors opened, and the prisoners' bonds and chains were broken. Under Roman law, if the keeper of the prison ever lost a prisoner, he had to die. So the jailer saw the open doors, he thought he would be killed. He pulled out his sword and was ready to kill himself, when Paul said, ""Don't do yourself any harm. We're still here."" The jailer fell trembling before them and asked, ""Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"" (Acts 16:30) They said, ""Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved-you and your household"" (Acts 16:31). The question the jailer asked was important, but the answer he received was just as important. We all need to be saved. We are like a man the Bible tells us about, a man who cried out, ""What must I do to be saved?""The Bible teaches that we all have broken God's Law. We all have sinned against God. We all are lawless. We all need salvation. Man without God makes his own plans, follows his own counsels and lives by his own rules. Nevertheless, because man was created for fellowship with God, there remains a dissatisfaction and longing within man that can only be fulfilled by God Himself. As man is now hopelessly corrupt and God is perfectly holy, there exists the need for God and man to be reconciled so that the fellowship may be restored. We read in the Bible, ""As many as received Jesus Christ, to them He gave the right to become the children of God, even to those who believe in His Name."" Being saved is nothing more than placing your faith in Jesus Christ for your salvation. It is choosing to trust Him and nothing else to save you and to take you to Heaven - (Eph. 2:8-9.) If you will place your faith in Jesus Christ, you need never fear dying lost. The Gospel is the good news about Jesus Christ. ""For God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, no longer counting people's sins against them...(2 Corinthians 5:19) God, fully knowing that man would fall, provided a means of reconciliation for man; He knew that there was nothing that a man could do to make mankind acceptable to God. ""All have sinned and come short of the glory of God"" (Romans 3:23) which condemns us to death ""to be cast in the lake of fire forever"" (Romans 6:23). But God sent Jesus Christ, who provided restoration for man with God by giving His own life, shedding His own blood. There was no other way to eradicate the effect of sin except by blood of Jesus. Bible says """"...Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins"" (Hebrew 9:22). This shedding of blood on the cross indicated that the penalty for sin had been paid; an innocent life had been sacrificed for the lives of all who have sinned."
Philippians 2:1-4,"('Relationships', 'Value System', 'Genuine Relationships')",Christian Missionary Alliance," Genuine Relationships 2/26/17 Philippians 2:1-4 INTRODUCTION Palmer Chinchen, PhD, True Religion (David C. Cook, 2010), pp. 122-123 In Malawi, practically any shoe is a luxury. Lilongwe, the capital, is maybe the only African city where I have seen grown men walking down the streets barefoot. They are ashamed, I know that, but they have no choice. So I was not surprised when I took our college basketball team from Wheaton to our first practice in the African Bible College gym, and two of the Malawians in the gym were scrimmaging with one shoe on. Several of our players began to snicker and point out to one another how funny it was that two guys were playing with a shoe on one foot and the other foot bare. One of them turned to my twin brother, who had lived in Malawi for more than ten years and was coaching the Malawian National Team, and asked why these guys were playing [basketball] in just one shoe. His answer was sobering: ""One of the guys showed up today with no shoes. His friend did not want him to be ashamed when you arrived, so he lent him one of his own. Now they both have at least one shoe."" The laughter stopped. One player looked out for the interests of another even to the extent of his own inconvenience, comfort, welfare. Phil 2:1-4 2 So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, 2complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. 3 Do nothing from rivalry or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. 4 Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. ESV HAVING EXPERIENCED THE AMAZING LOVE OF JESUS, FREES US TO EXPERIENCE DEEP, GENUINE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHERS. I. It all begins with our experience with Jesus. Paul is using an if/then argument in Philippians. The first core value was all about divine intimacy and the pursuit of divine intimacy leads us to the other core values, active repentance, Holy Spirit Dependence, whole life stewardship, Passionate Purpose. One final reality we expect to discover as we pursue HIM--genuine relationships with other. Author Brennan Manning shared that it is only because we are loved so fully by God that we are free to love others. To me, it's more important to be loved than to love. When I have not had the experience of being loved by God, just as I am and not as I should be, then loving others becomes a duty, a responsibility, a chore. But if I let myself be loved as I am, with the love of God poured into my heart by the Holy Spirit, then I can reach out to others in a more effortless way. When we went to Idaho Road, Adam Fleder Pledged friendship, deep friendship to us. Why? How could he do that? We didn't' know each other. Adam understood that the nature of relationships after we have discovered Christ changes. A. There is a healing in our relationship with Jesus that changes our relationship capacity. If So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy,"
John 3:22-36,"('Humility', 'Land', 'Competition', 'Detriment')",Baptist," DETRIMENTAL COMPETITION-I--John 3:22-36 A DETRIMENTAL SPIRIT Attention: Humility in competition seems somewhat rare. I can remember seeing & hearing an American long-jumper & runner--Carl Lewis--in the Olympics(1988 Summer?) who just 'tore-up' his competition. He outran & out-jumped everybody! In his heyday Carl Lewis won a gold medal in the same event in four consecutive Olympic Games. He set world records in the 100m, 4-man 100m, & 4-man 200m relays. On top of that, his world record in the indoor long jump has stood since 1984. Mr. Lewis was voted ""World Athlete of the Century"" by the International Association of Athletics Federations & ""Sportsman of the Century"" by the International Olympic Committee, ""Olympian of the Century"" by Sports Illustrated, & ""Athlete of the Year"" by Track & Field News in 1982, 1983, & 1984. America was so proud of their runner...Sort of. You see, on the outset of all the achievements, Carl Lewis was noted for 'his self-congratulatory conduct.' That attitude caused him to be passed over by potential endorsers! And his attitude caused me to distance myself from any national pride or congratulations that involved Carl Lewis. Mr. Lewis undid his own success thru his boastful attitude! While empowered & triumphant in Christ, the Church & individual Christians within the church, can allow their privilege in Christ to turn into entitlement & deserving. Such a Competitive spirit is Detrimental to the Christian faith. Likewise, biblically doctrinal(truth) understanding is vital to your growth as a Christian! *Verses :25 & 26 form the hinge/focus around which this passage flows. John the Baptist pointed out the weakness/detriments/absurdities/incompatibilities of competitive ministry. A competitive spirit can be detrimental to Christian ministry. cf.--Php. 1:15-18--""Some indeed preach Christ even from envy & strife, & some also from good will: The former preach Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my chains; but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel. What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; & in this I rejoice, yes, & will rejoice."" ""The last thing...Jonah wanted...was for"" -(the city of)- ""Nineveh to repent at his preaching; but"" his... ""message)(from God)-...produced repentance in spite of his ill intentions.""--MNTC Local churches can operate & function as if they are in competition with other churches in the area. Any true church's 'competitive edge' is supplied by Christ Jesus Himself! You do not need to protect Jesus!(cf.-Jud. 6:25-32). You need to be a defender of the faith(1Pet. 3:14-16; Jude :3-5) but not a guardian of Jesus Himself. We are always best served, & the Good News is best served, & the Kingdom of God is best served, by those who preach Christ from good will, rather than from envy & strife. When is a competitive spirit detrimental to Christian ministry? 9 detriments of a competitive spirit to Christian ministry."
Matthew 4:1-11,"('Temptation', 'Testing', 'Trials', 'Temptations', 'Shema Yisrael')",United Methodist," Intro Life is filled with trials and temptations. Sometimes we fail. Jesus too was faced with great temptations, but he succeeded. Goal Let's learn how Jesus battled temptations and won. Plan We will look at the testing of Christ in Matthew 4:1-11. Matthew 4:1-2 Led by the Spirit We read in Matthew 4:1-2, Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted there by the devil. For forty days and forty nights he fasted and became very hungry. In these verses, Jesus was tried. Did he love God1 with all his heart, soul, and strength (Deuteronomy 6:5)? Jesus' responses2 come from a section of the Old Testament (Deuteronomy 6-8) that begins with the well-known saying, the Shema Yisrael (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) commanding our love for God. The Greek word for tempted also means being tested. Jesus' love for God was being tested after a preparatory time of fasting. Would he pass the test? 1Brown, Fitzmyer & Murphy. The New Jerome Biblical Commentary. Prentice Hall. 1990. 638. 2R. T. France. The New International Commentary of the New Testament. The Gospel of Matthew. Wm. B. Eerdmans. 2007. 124-136. Matthew 4:3 Jesus' First Test Matthew 4:3 reveals the 1st of 3 tests on Jesus. We read, ""During that time the devil came and said to him, ""If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread."" In this verse the tempter is introduced. His form is not given. He tries to incite Jesus to do his bidding. If he really is the son of God, he should not need to put up with lack of food. His appetite is tested. Would he use his heavenly powers to satisfy the lusts of the flesh? Would he pass the test? Do we follow the tempter's untrustworthy words or God the Father's? Matthew 4:4 Jesus' First Test Response In Matthew 4:4 we read of Jesus' response to the 1st of 3 tests as the tempter tried to trick him into turning stones to bread. But Jesus told him, ""No! The Scriptures say, 'People do not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"" This is a quote from Deuteronomy 8:3, which tells us the context. God fed ancient Israel manna, so they would learn to be fed by Him and not their own efforts. Even though he had the power to make bread from stones, Jesus had the answer in Scripture and waited for His Father's timing to be revealed. Matthew 4:5-6 Jesus' Second Test In Matthew 4:5-6 we read, Then the devil took him to the holy city, Jerusalem, to the highest point of the Temple, and said, ""If you are the Son of God, jump off! For the Scriptures say, 'He will order his angels to protect you. And they will hold you up with their hands so you won't even hurt your foot on a stone.'"" Would Jesus be tempted by the pride of life and take a foolish leap from a Temple wing perhaps 50 meters above ground? How often do we take foolish chances without prayer? How often do we confuse a foolish jump with a Spirit-led leap of faith? Matthew 4:7 Jesus' Second Test Response When tempted by the devil to take a foolish leap from a Temple wing, Matthew 4:7 says, Jesus responded, ""The Scriptures also say, 'You must not test the Lord your God.'"" He wasn't fooled by someone twisting Scripture. Jesus quoted Deuteronomy 6:16 where Moses and Aaron had tried to take glory to themselves for a miracle involving water, instead of giving God the glory (Numbers 20:7-12). This cuts to the heart of the test. Instead of bringing glory to himself with a big display, did Jesus only want to bring glory to the Father? Do we trust God at His word or provoke Him with our presumptuous self-will?"
Genesis 22:1-19,"('Trust', 'Jehovah Jireh', 'Dependence On God', 'The Lord Provides')",Nazarene," Genesis 22:1-19 (Please open your Bibles so you can read along) Think about our Memory Refresher Scripture for today - Philippians 4:6-7. ""Do not be anxious about anything!"" Have you ever noticed that sometimes the things we become anxious about are because we have done something wrong and have backed ourselves into a corner? Other times the Lord will put us into a situation where we cannot see the answer and our only option is to rely on Him for the solution. Of course, we always have the option of trying to resolve the dilemma on our own which only makes the matter worse. Let's go ahead and read Genesis 21:1-19 now and see how the Lord provided for Abraham in a time of testing. Genesis 22:13-14a NIV ""Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram caught by its horns. He went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son. So Abraham called that place 'The Lord Will Provide.'"" Do you remember the first song we sang this morning; Jehovah-Jireh? This passage we read today is where that name, Jehovah-Jireh, The LORD will Provide, originates in the Bible. And, actually, this is the only place where this name for the LORD is used. Now, what is one of the basic rules of Bible study? If we see something only in one place in the Bible we need to try to understand what it means especially if it is not reaffirmed in other places in the Bible. For instance, Jesus is quoted as saying in Mark 16:17b-18a NIV ""... In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all ..."" We know now that verses 9-20 are not found in the earliest manuscripts and apparently were added later. We don't practice picking up snakes with our hands or knowingly drink deadly poison. Why? Because we don't find those practices in other places in the Bible. And yet, there are churches that practice such actions as part of their worship services. So, what about Jehovah-Jireh? Why do we sing songs about this name of the LORD if it is only found in one place in the Bible? Well, we sing the songs because the activity of the LORD providing is found all throughout the Bible! Genesis 1:1 NIV ""In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."" Now, that's a pretty good provision, isn't it? Where would we be without that provision? Absolutely no where, that's where! Genesis 2:8 NIV ""Now the Lord God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there He put the man He had formed."" It's not long until we see that Abraham has his son Isaac tied up, laid on a pile of wood for a burnt offering and Abraham, Isaacs' dad, has a knife in his hand raised above Isaac, about to sacrifice his only son according to the command of the LORD. Look at verses 1-3 again with me. Genesis 22:1-3 NIV ""Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, 'Abraham!' 'Here I am,' he replied."

Psalms 6:9 The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer. Matthew 21:22 And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive. Luke 19:46 Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves. 1. Pray to the father. John 16: 23 And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. 2. Pray in the name of Jesus. John 14: 12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. 13 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14 If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. 15 If ye love me, keep my commandments. 3.By the Holy Spirit. Romans 8: 26 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. 4.With full understanding of rights and privileges. 1st Cor.14: 14 For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful. 15 What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also. 5. In harmony with the word. John 15: 7 If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. 6. In faith no doubting. John 15: 16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. 7. With praise for our answer. Philippians 4: 5 Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. 6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God."
Ephesians 5:11-14,"('Witness', 'Faith', 'Witnessing')",Christian/Church Of Christ," INTRODUCTION "" SLIDE #1 "" It is amazing how much life changes when one gives their life to Jesus. "" Today we are going to continue with our series, TURNING OVER A NEW LEAF. "" In this series we have been examining some of the contrasts of the old life we used to live with the new life we are called to live in Christ. "" When one gives their life to Christ, our life should be always in the process of transformation. "" This is thought is in line with Galatians 2:20 "" SLIDE #2 "" Galatians 2:20 (HCSB) and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. "" This is a tall order for one to follow, and it is impossible to do without the help of the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirt. "" Today we are going to examine what is a call for a new focus for those in Christ. "" Part of the daily transformation process you undergo in Christ has implications for both yourself as we as those who are in your sphere of influence. "" When you look at the title to the message this morning, the title can make this new focus seem REALLY negative and judgmental; however, as we delve into the message, you will see that our new focus is anything but negative and judgmental. "" So, let's begin exploring our new focus together. We will be in Ephesians 5:11-14, we will open up with verse 11, we will focus on the first part of the verse. "" SLIDE #3 "" Ephesians 5:11 (HCSB) Don't participate in the fruitless works of darkness, but instead expose them. "" SLIDE #4 SERMON I. An implication of your faith. V11a "" One of the implications of our faith is that we refrain from participating in the fruitless works of darkness. "" The phrase DON'T PARTICIPATE is a call for one to stop sharing together with those who do such stuff. "" It is a call to choose which type of path one is going to follow as Jerry articulated last week in his message on A New WAY TO WALK. "" One of the implications of one's faith is the choice between walking in the light or participating in the fruitless works of darkness. "" In the previous verses we have covered some of the fruitless works of darkness. "" By works of darkness are meant such things as immorality, impurity, greed, filthiness, silly talk, etc. (5:3, 4), and also those mentioned in 4:25-32; briefly, any and all works belonging to the realm of depravity and inspired by its prince. (Baker NTC) "" They are referred as such because those works do nothing to enhance your life, they offer momentary pleasure and will never fulfill you. The fruitless deeds are incapable of functioning usefully in one's life. "" They are called deeds of darkness because darkness represents the evil realm, the sphere dominated by evil, sinfulness and ignorance of the ways of the Lord. "" THIS IS ONE THING I WANT YOU TO HOLD ON TO, DARKNESS IS ALSO ABSENCE OF LIGHT. "" That seems like a simple statement, but in a few minutes, you will see why it is an important thought to hold on to! "" You notice the more shady things of life are done in the dark. A thief does not come a night and light up the neighborhood, he is trying to do what he does under the cover of darkness."
Genesis 1:1-2:3,"('Creation', 'Comfort')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Scripture Today, I am beginning a new series of sermons on the first eleven chapters of Genesis that I am calling, ""In the Beginning."" For the next year or so, I plan to preach short series of sermons, alternating between Genesis and Ephesians. My intention for ""In the Beginning"" is to preach 6 messages on Genesis 1-11. Naturally, this will be more of an overview rather than a verse-by-verse exposition of the text. Expounding an entire narrative will give us a view of the flow of redemptive history and what God was doing in the beginning in the salvation of sinners. I am hoping that by alternating short series of sermons between Genesis and Ephesians we will all stay engaged in worship, learning, and growing in the knowledge and grace of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Also, if we need to address something different, it will be easy to do so. The book of Genesis opens with the words, ""In the beginning...."" This is the English translation of the first word in the Hebrew, ""Bereshit."" In fact, God's people in the Old Testament called this book Bereshit. The English title ""Genesis"" comes from the Greek word that means ""origins."" It was called the ""Book of Origins"" because it provides a description of the origin of the heavens, the earth, inanimate life, and animate life, including human beings. So, a good question, as we begin our study in Genesis, is, ""Why study the book of Genesis?"" Old Testament scholar Tremper Longman III answers: To understand our origins. To understand who we are, our meaning in life. To comprehend our place in the world, our relationship with other creatures, with other humans and with God himself. To recognize the significance of the rest of redemptive history culminating in the ministry of Jesus Christ. Our brief overview of Genesis 1-11 will address, at least briefly, some of these answers. I should make one further comment as we commence our study of Genesis. My conviction is that the Word of God, which of course includes Genesis, is the ultimate and supreme authority. So, where there are questions about science and Scripture, or history and Scripture, or geography and Scripture, or whatever and Scripture, the supreme authority belongs to Scripture. The reason for doing so is because God is the author of Scripture. The conviction that Scripture is the supreme authority has important implications for how we view science, history, geography, and so on, as we shall see in the coming weeks. So, let us now read about God creating the heavens and the earth in Genesis 1:1-2:3: 1 In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. 2 The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. 3 And God said, ""Let there be light,"" and there was light. 4 And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day."
Esther 4:1-17,"('Justice', 'Evangelization', 'Genocide', 'Prayer And Obedience')",Catholic," Thursday of first week in Lent 2017 Joy of the Gospel The first Hitler was a fellow named Haman, a member of a tribe that had almost been wiped out by the Hebrews maybe a thousand years before Haman. Haman hatched a plot to kill all the Jews in Persia, and even got the king to order their destruction. The king's prime wife was Esther, a Jew, and so a classic confrontation between the idea of genocide solving all problems and the reality of Esther's love for her people was set up. The Greek version of the Book of Esther records the prayers that rose up from all the Jews. God heard and answered and Haman was hanged on the gallows he had set up for uncle Mordecai and the other Jews. Isn't it true that so many of our self-centered ideas have come into conflict with divine reality and God has in His mercy preserved us from evil by saying ""no"" to our plans? The Pope comments on this conflict meme: 'There also exists a constant tension between ideas and realities. Realities simply are, whereas ideas are worked out. There has to be continuous dialogue between the two, lest ideas become detached from realities. It is dangerous to dwell in the realm of words alone, of images and rhetoric. So a third principle comes into play: realities are greater than ideas. This calls for rejecting the various means of masking reality: angelic forms of purity, dictatorships of relativism, empty rhetoric, objectives more ideal than real, brands of ahistorical fundamentalism, ethical systems bereft of kindness, intellectual discourse bereft of wisdom. 'Ideas - conceptual elaborations - are at the service of communication, understanding, and praxis. Ideas disconnected from realities give rise to ineffectual forms of idealism and nominalism, capable at most of classifying and defining, but certainly not calling to action. What calls us to action are realities illuminated by reason. Formal nominalism has to give way to harmonious objectivity. Otherwise, the truth is manipulated, cosmetics take the place of real care for our bodies. We have politicians - and even religious leaders - who wonder why people do not understand and follow them, since their proposals are so clear and logical. Perhaps it is because they are stuck in the realm of pure ideas and end up reducing politics or faith to rhetoric. Others have left simplicity behind and have imported a rationality foreign to most people. 'Realities are greater than ideas. This principle has to do with incarnation of the word and its being put into practice: ""By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is from God"" (1 Jn 4:2). The principle of reality, of a word already made flesh and constantly striving to take flesh anew, is essential to evangelization. It helps us to see that the Church's history is a history of salvation, to be mindful of those saints who inculturated the Gospel in the life of our peoples and to reap the fruits of the Church's rich bimillennial tradition, without pretending to come up with a system of thought detached from this treasury, as if we wanted to reinvent the Gospel. At the same time, this principle impels us to put the word into practice, to perform works of justice and charity which make that word fruitful. Not to put the word into practice, not to make it reality, is to build on sand, to remain in the realm of pure ideas and to end up in a lifeless and unfruitful self-centredness and gnosticism.'"
Acts 2:37-40,"('Repent', 'Holy Ghost', 'Pricked In Their Heart', 'Be Baptized')",Baptist," August 12, 2013 By: Tom Lowe Series: The Early Church Title: People Cut to the Heart Acts 2.37-40 (KJV) 37 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? 38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. 39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. 40 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation. Introduction We have seen the wonderful effect of the pouring out of the Spirit in the influence it had on Peter and the other preachers of the gospel. Peter, in all his life, never spoke at such length as he did now, and with such volume, eloquence, and power. We are now going to see another blessed fruit of the pouring out of the Spirit in the influence it had upon the hearers of the gospel. From the first words of that marvelous message, it appeared that there was a divine energy going along with it, and it was mighty through the power of God, to do great and wonderful things: thousands were immediately converted by saving faith; it was due to the rod of God's strength sent out of Zion: ""The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth"" (Psalms 110:2-3; KJV). The rod of thy strength is a poetic expression for His ruling power. The ruling power of the Messiah was to go forth from Jerusalem, Zion's city of our God. The rule and reign of Jesus Christ during this age is not one of power and bloodshed, but rather of conquering love and grace. One day, however, when the curtain of God's grace comes crashing down and the curtain of His wrath is raised, ""... he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God"" (Rev 19:15). Because of the power of the gospel and of the mighty hand of the Lord God, the servants of the Saviour will be willingly ruled by the Messiah. Men under the influence of the gospel do not submit themselves to the service of the King out of fear, but in the beauties of holiness, i.e., in holy obedience to the one who is both Priest and King. Just as the dew falls fresh every morning and is perpetually resupplied, so too are those who fall to the message of God's redeeming grace and join the ranks of the saved. We have here the first-fruits of that vast harvest of souls which was gathered to Jesus Christ. Come and see, in these verses, the exalted Redeemer riding forth, in these chariots of salvation, conquering and to conquer--""And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer"" (Rev. 6.2; KJV)."
1 John 2:3-26,"('Knowing Christ', 'Fellowship With God', 'Walking In Love', 'Evidences Of Faith')",Baptist," SHOW EVIDENCES OF KNOWING GOD. 1ST John 2: 3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. 4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 5 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. 6 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked. 1. Keeping his Commandments. 2. By walking Godly as Jesus did. 3. By loving the brethren. 9 He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now. 4. By having sins forgiven. 12 I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake. 5. Knowing Jesus and overcoming Satan. 13 I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father. 6. By the Word abiding in you. 14 I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one. 7. By doing the will of God not the world. 15 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. 8. Let Christ abide in you. 24 Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father. 9. Remain in Christ. 27 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him."
Psalms 51:1-17,"('Faith', 'Praise', 'Repentance', ""Jesus' Sacrifice"")",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," A SPRINKLING WITH HYSSOP Psalm 51:1-17 In this solemn Psalm of repentance, we dive in (headfirst, as it were) with a plea for mercy. The verbs ""have mercy... blot out... wash me... cleanse me"" (Psalm 51:1-2) all appear to be in the imperative: but they are in fact plaintive pleas based in the fact that there is no redemption outside of God Himself. This is the task of the awakened conscience: ""I acknowledge my transgressions; my sin is ever before me"" (Psalm 51:3). Although our offences are often manifested in the pain which we bring to others, sin is first and foremost a slight to the character of God. I have wronged Bathsheba, David could say; I have wronged her husband Uriah; I have wronged my general Joab; I have wronged my people as their king: but above all, I have wronged God. Before I can even begin to go about my job of seeking reconciliation with these other people, I stand at the bar of God: ""Against thee have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight"" (Psalm 51:4). We are not making excuses when we have recourse to observations about our tendency towards sin. David is not slandering his mother when he suggests that he was 'conceived in sin' (Psalm 51:5) - he is rather recognising that the tendency to sin is inherent in the human character. We are left without excuse once we realise that, not only did we inherit Adam's fall, but we were equipped with a sense of right and wrong, even from the womb (Psalm 51:6)! Once again, the Psalmist makes his plea, but this time he mingles it with faith: ""Purge me, and I shall be clean... wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow... make me to hear joy and gladness, that I may rejoice"" (Psalm 51:7-8). The purging is with hyssop, an aromatic herb used in the sprinkling of blood at the first Passover (cf. Exodus 12 :22). Significantly it was also used for the cleansing of lepers (cf. Leviticus 14:6-8). David was faced with the leprosy of sin in his own life. The penalty for both adultery and murder was death, with no provision for their forgiveness in the Jewish faith. Yet somehow, he believed that God could provide a sacrifice (cf. Genesis 22:8), and blood could be sprinkled even for his sins! Well, just like Abraham was provided with a ram for a sacrifice in lieu of Isaac (cf. Genesis 22:13), the LORD had already provided a lamb for David. Oh, this was a Lamb which had not yet been sacrificed: yet it would be true to say that Jesus' blood was sacrificed for the sins of his forebear (cf. Matthew 1:1), just as surely as it was for ours too. Thus, God is seen to be both just, and the justifier of those who believe in Jesus (cf. Romans 3:25-26); and to hide His face from our sins, and blot out all our iniquities (Psalm 51:9). Having been purged of sin, we will then be able to enter into the positive benefits of reconciliation with God. We shall be satisfied with nothing short of the Holy Spirit's presence in our lives (Psalm 51:10-12). Then we shall be equipped to teach others, and see others converted to the Lord (Psalm 51:13)."
Genesis 4:16-24,"('Creation', 'Technology', 'City Of God', 'Idolatry')",United Methodist," Technology and the Soul of Man Genesis 4:16-24 We live in a blizzard of new technology today. We even wonder how we could live without it. I can remember the surprise snowstorm which hit the South in March of 1993 when the power was out in some places here for a week. It was interesting to see how much things were affected here back then. Now, such an outage would be absolutely disruptive. To give an example of this, I can remember going to a large Christian youth event and seeing the young people gathered around in a large room texting and staring at their phones. No one was looking at one another. This room had large couches on it, and there was a teenage boy on one end of the sofa texting a teenage girl. I could see a sense of excitement on the young man as though he had some affection for the girl he was texting. As it turned out, the young lady he was texting was sitting at the other end of the couch! My have times changed! Wonderful, this new technology! Now technology can be used to good purposes. Martin Luther was a master of the new technology of his day, the printing press. This mastery of the press led to a much needed reformation of the church and a reordering of society. In the same way, the Internet provides an opportunity to broadcast the gospel to the world. In fact, this is why I publish my sermons on-line. But we must also be critical of technology as well. This is especially true in a world that is becoming increasingly godless. What affect does technology have on the soul of man. Let us take a look. The first place to evaluate technology is to see what the Bible says about it. At the very beginning we see that God created the world by speaking rather than making it with His hands. I know there is metaphor being used here, but the Bible clearly wants us to observe the distinction between how God creates and how we create. In addition, God created all from nothing, whereas we have to create using raw materials of God's creation. In the passage we read from this morning, we are introduced to man's introduction of technology. In says Enoch made the first city, Jubal made the first musical instrument, and that Tubal-Cain was the master of crafting in bronze and iron. It is very important to notice here that all of these mentioned people were of the line of Cain and not Seth. Whereas the seed of Seth was preserved through the flood, all of Cain's descendants perished. So very early in the Bible, technology made by the hands of man is seen in a negative light. They are associated with ultimate destruction rather than the means of making a better world. The downward spiral of Cain's line was remarkable, I was started by a cursed murderer, Cain and spiraled downward. Even as technology advanced, the soul of man declined. We read of Lamech's miserable poem glorying in his killing a man. Later the Bible mentions the sons of god sleeping with the daughters of men. We don't know exactly what that means, but whatever it was, it was in a context of something that was displeasing to God. Finally, the last straw was that the world was filled with violence. Technology did not make for a better world. This is because the hearts of men were corrupt and evil. Technology could only amplify the power to do evil. The result was the utter annihilation of the effort. The flood came, and only Noah and his family found grace in the sight of the Lord."
Matthew 4:1-11,"('Temptation', 'Faithfulness', 'Temptation And Sin')",*other," One sagging electrical line near Cleveland, Ohio, connected with a tree branch at 3:32 p.m. on August 14, 2003, beginning a chain of events that led to the largest blackout in American history. According to a comprehensive study, the failure of this single transmission line caused a utility company in southern Ohio to overload and seal itself off from the now infamous power grid. To the north, this created a huge need for power, and Cleveland began pulling an unsustainable amount of electricity from Michigan and Ontario...knocking out more transmission lines and generating plants. When the demand for power reached New York, power plants there sealed themselves from the grid in order to protect their own systems. This, however, created a new problem: New York City (ironically) had too much electricity and overloaded its own system. The result: history's largest shutdown. Isn't it amazing? One sagging power line touches a tree branch, and blacks out a coastline over 460 miles away - how is that for a ripple effect? The truth is, seemingly small actions can lead to devastating consequences. The same is true of sin--a brush with temptation leads to an act or decision that can eventually ruin families, devastate churches and incapacitate our fellowship with God. OYB to Matthew 4. I. INTRODUCTION 1. We tend to think of temptation as the influence of evil in our lives, and perhaps in some way it is. One must ask, however, how we explain Adam and Eve's temptation and subsequent sin; after all, they had no evil in their lives when they faced temptation. What about Job? He was tempted beyond imagination--what evil existed in his life? 2. Most importantly, how do we explain the temptation of Jesus? Today we consider his temptation in order to develop a deeper understanding of temptation itself: its source, purpose, and role in our spiritual formation. 3. Lent recalls the forty days Jesus spent in the wilderness to prepare for his ministry. Our goal during Lent is to prepare ourselves for the ministry to which God calls us. II. TEMPTATION DEFINED 1. The OT word for temptation (??????? refers to the testing or proving of armor in 1 Sa. 17:39, and in Gen. 22:2 characterizes God's command to Abraham to offer Isaac as a burnt offering. A. A similar use of the term refers to God's testing of people (Ex. 16:4, 20:20; Dt. 8:2,16; Ps. 26:2) as he did in Egypt, performing terrible and wonderful acts to test the will of the Pharaoh. We must note however, that the OT rarely (if ever) applies this word to Satan's act of enticing people into sin. B. Interestingly, the OT makes it clear that man can tempt God, though scripture expressly forbids the practice. In this understanding, man is not enticing God to sin, but rather testing him in order to challenge his will. 2. The NT word for temptation also applies to man's testing of God. Peter uses it to describe the sin of Ananias and Sapphira in Acts 5:9; yet, in our gospel lesson of the morning, Satan leads Jesus into the wilderness in order to tempt him. With all these possibilities, what should we understand about temptation? Does man tempt God, God tempt man, or does Satan tempt both? Is temptation the work of Satan, or the work of God? Who is in charge here?"

Acts 5:1-10,"('Judgement', 'Holy Spirit', 'Deceit')",Baptist," ""A man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property, and with his wife's knowledge he kept back for himself some of the proceeds and brought only a part of it and laid it at the apostles' feet. But Peter said, 'Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land? While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to man but to God.' When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and breathed his last. And great fear came upon all who heard of it. The young men rose and wrapped him up and carried him out and buried him. ""After an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. And Peter said to her, 'Tell me whether you sold the land for so much.' And she said, 'Yes, for so much.' But Peter said to her, 'How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.' Immediately she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. When the young men came in they found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband."" [1] I f God killed every Christian who lied, the churches would be empty. This does not excuse lying, but it does acknowledge our fallibility. We know we are to be truthful in our speech and in our actions. However, we fail miserably to live up to what we know to be correct. Nevertheless, there is a point at which God does finally say, ""Enough!"" Knowing this to be true, Christians need to learn restraint. We need to hear the words of Jesus, who taught us, ""Let what you say be simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything more than this comes from evil"" [MATTHEW 5:37]. In fact, God does not kill individuals because they lie. There is, as you suspect, a caveat to be pronounced. Lying to the Holy Spirit invites immediate and severe judgement--and the more so when the lying revolves around idolatry. Idolatry? Where is the idolatry in this pericope? It is a legitimate question. Think of a few portions of the Word and the idolatry becomes apparent. There are several verses that we should hold in mind as we prepare to study why God would kill this husband and his wife. In order to prepare ourselves, I invite you to join me in looking at two verses in the Letter that the Apostle Paul wrote to the Colossian congregation. ""Put to death what belongs to your worldly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desire, and greed, which is idolatry. Because of these, God's wrath comes on the disobedient"" [COLOSSIANS 3:5, 6 HCSB]. Again, consider what Paul has written in EPHESIANS 5:3-7 as translated in the NET BIBLE. ""Among you there must not be either sexual immorality, impurity of any kind, or greed, as these are not fitting for the saints. Neither should there be vulgar speech, foolish talk, or coarse jesting--all of which are out of character--but rather thanksgiving. For you can be confident of this one thing: that no person who is immoral, impure, or greedy (such a person is an idolater) has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God."

Exodus 3:11-15,"('Spiritual Warfare', 'Positive Thinking', 'Soar High')",Christian/Church Of Christ," Are you soaring? 1 John 5:18-19 (NIV) 18 We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the One who was born of God keeps them safe, and the evil one cannot harm them. 19 We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one. We must be aware that Spiritual Warfare is going on all around us and there is only one way to guard ourselves, in Christ. Are you a person with confidence in yourself? As you go through each day each one of us has an inner conversation always going on? My question is ""What are you saying to yourself?"" Are you thinking positive thoughts, empowering thoughts, affirming thoughts, or do you go around thinking negative thoughts? I'm not that talented, I've made too many mistakes. ""You can't soar as an eagle if you're living spiritually as a chicken!!"" This is one reason so many people do not soar as Christians. They simply aren't having a positive outlook on their lives. Don't listen to negative thoughts and if that's all that's playing, learn to put on a new recording. If you are a Christian, God sees you as His Champion! Who am I? - is the question I would like you to examine about ourselves today. Am I a Christian? No? Then your life is in shambles, your life needs help. (My life is fine, not your spiritual life.) Jesus said in talking to Nicodemus John 3:3 (NIV) 3 Jesus replied, ""Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again. Christian and non-Christian alike must get our thoughts and actions moving in the right directions if you truly want to become better. (In the Book Devil Demons and Spiritual Warfare by Tom Brown) he says ""Recognize that nothing is greater than God! Satan has power but not divine power. God's mercy is greater than sin! God's provision is greater than lack! God's wisdom is greater than confusion! God's love in your heart is greater than any bitterness you can feel! If you think your problems are greater than God's ability to solve them, then you will be overcome with fear!"" I want to look at 2 examples in the Bible of Great Christians, leaders of God's people that had to discover who they really were before they could accomplish God's task. Judges 6:12-16 (NIV) 12 When the angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon, he said, ""The Lord is with you, mighty warrior."" 13 ""Pardon me, my lord,"" Gideon replied, ""but if the Lord is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our ancestors told us about when they said, 'Did not the Lord bring us up out of Egypt?' But now the Lord has abandoned us and given us into the hand of Midian."" 14 The Lord turned to him and said, ""Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian's hand. Am I not sending you?"" 15 ""Pardon me, my lord,"" Gideon replied, ""but how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family."""
Mark 10:46-52,"('Salvation', 'Bartimaeus', 'Miracles Of Jesus', 'Changed Lives')",Baptist," The Divine Difference Jesus Can Make Mark 10:46-52 Sermon by Rick Crandall Grayson Baptist Church - Jan. 22, 2017 *This week, I've been thinking about people who have made a difference in my life. My wife has made an infinite difference in my life. Anybody who knows Mary knows what a blessing she is. And Church: You have made a difference in both of our lives. *This past week, one of our old friends from the 1970s passed away. His name was Jimmy Posey. And though I haven't seen him in 40 years, Jimmy made a giant difference in my life. My co-teacher, Georgia Savoie had invited us to McClendon Baptist Church in West Monroe, and we started going. Georgia was the choir director, and she asked us to be in the young adult choir. Even though she knew I wasn't a Christian, she asked me to be in the choir. *One weekend we went on a choir retreat, and that night around the fireplace people gave their Christian testimonies. Mary and I were the only people on the back row, because the pastor and his wife Georgia knew I didn't have a testimony. *Jimmy Posey was one of the last people to speak, and he started to weep about his twin brother, Jerry, who was not saved at the time. Jimmy had the same passion our Katie had a few weeks ago, when she prayed for Papaw Breard to be saved. And as Jimmy was pouring his heart out, that's when the light went on for me. *I remember thinking, ""This is real! Jesus is real! The Bible is true. Jesus really does love me. He died on the cross for me."" I realized that those people had something in their life that I did not have, and I wanted it. That night I received Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior, and God used Jimmy Posey to help turn on the light. *Many wonderful people have made great differences in our lives, but standing over and above them all is Jesus Himself! Let's look into God's Word, and see how Jesus makes a divine difference in our lives. 1. First: He gives us a new desire. *Jesus gives us a new desire. That's what happened to blind Bartimaeus in vs. 46-47: 46. Then they came to Jericho. And as He went out of Jericho with His disciples and a great multitude, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the road begging. 47. And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, ""Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!'' [1] Blind Bartimaeus was in a terrible situation. *Simon Rundell explained that ""today, people with serious vision problems can live full, happy and productive lives. But back then, it was very different: No sight, no work, no work, no food, a very direct relationship. So Bartimaeus sat by the roadside hoping that someone would pity him and would fill his bowl with food, or maybe give him a few coins to purchase the things everyone needs. *Because he was blind, Bartimaeus was less than human to many people. He was an object to be pitied, or cursed, or ignored. He was desperately trapped by the Jericho Road, as the world passed him by."" (1) *The world had little or nothing to offer Bartimaeus. And in our health and comfort, in our freedom and affluence, it can be hard for us to relate to Bartimaeus. But surely we know about troubles, too."
"2 Samuel 11:1-27, 2 Samuel 12:1-15","('Forgiveness General', 'Sin And Forgiveness', 'Adultry', 'Abdication Of Throne')",Charismatic," The Playboy Problem Today we are going to discuss chapter 3 of Ed Cole's Maximized Manhood titled 'The Playboy Problem"". And our resident playboy is found in 2 Samuel 11 and his name is King David. David's background: "" Battle tested three times at a young age "" Man after God's own heart (1 Sam 13:14, Act 13:22) "" Had that famous quote, ""For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God."" ""You come to me with a sword, spear and shield (javelin). But I am come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defiled."" "" Loved by the people "" Brought the Ark of the Covenant of God back to the children of Israel "" Naked dance With so many accolades tied to his name, he truly has done what we would consider kingly. So what does a king with power want? He wants more power. And in this search for it he makes a detour which leads to harsh consequences. Many, if not all of us, have been in the same boat. (Are your with me?) 2 Samuel 11:1-2 ""It happened in the spring of the year, at the time when kings go out to battle, that David sent Joab and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the people of Ammon and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem. 2 Then it happened one evening that David arose from his bed and walked on the roof of the king's house. And from the roof he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful to behold."" After a long day of work, we come home and pet the dog on his head, high-five the kids, kiss the wife on the cheek and then retreat to our man cave. This is a place where nobody knows our name. We sit down to rest our body and naturally our spirit follows as well. But I Peter 5:8 (amp) ""Be sober [well balanced and self-disciplined], be alert and cautious at all times. That enemy of yours, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion [fiercely hungry], seeking someone to devour."" 1. Take Captive Our Thoughts In short order, it means we need to always be on our toes, be at the ready. As watchmen we are in high places so that we may see far off, physically and spiritually. Remember this though. Our adversary doesn't want us on post. He wants us off guard (unbalanced). He wants us not focused, undisciplined (not following our call) because he has a plan to throw us off keel. Champions, no matter what the day, week or month may bring at your, remember to seek God not just for rest, but revelation of self. Revelation through his eyes of what enemy is in us and before us. Ephesians 6:12 ""For we wrestle not against flesh & blood, but against principalities & against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."" The very thing contrary to our way of living is the very thing that will present itself as attractive. Genesis 3:6 ""And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also to her husband with her, and he did eat."""
John 15:1-8,"('Jesus', 'Fruit', 'Vine', 'Abide')",Christian/Church Of Christ," Over the past few weeks, we have considered several I AM statements of Jesus. These are the things that Jesus said about Himself. In John Chapter 10, Jesus said ""I AM the door."" He is the way into God's kingdom. In John Chapter 8, Jesus said ""I AM the light of the world."" He shines in the darkness of sin to show us the way to God. In John Chapter 6, Jesus says, ""I AM the bread of life."" He says that those who come to Him will never to hungry and those who believe in Him will never be thirsty. Today, I want us to look at a passage of scripture from John Chapter 15. Now let's set the stage for this passage. Leading up to this passage of scripture, several significant things have happened. On the Sunday before, Jesus rode into Jerusalem and was hailed as a king. The people lined the road shouting ""Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord. Blessed is the king of Israel."" As the week progresses, Jesus teaches his disciples the very hard truth that His earthly ministry is coming to an end. On Thursday of that week, Jesus takes the disciples to the Upper Room to participate in the Passover feast. And during that time, Jesus washes the disciples' feet, telling them that He is setting an example for them to follow. They are to be servants, even as Jesus came to be a servant. Jesus institutes the Lord's Supper, telling His disciples to continue to participate in this meal as a remembrance of Him. Jesus also predicts His betrayal by Judas and Peter's denials. Jesus clearly tells the disciples that He will be with them only a short while longer. But He promises them a helper. The Holy Spirit would come to be an Advocate and a guide for them and to lead them into the truth of His word. As His disciples are clearly troubled at His words that He would be crucified and then would leave them, Jesus has more words of comfort for them. They sing a hymn together, and at this point, Jesus leads the disciples out of the upper room and they are on their way to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray. But as they are on their way, Jesus speaks to the disciples again. Listen to the words that Jesus says to the disciples: John 15:1-8 (NIV84) The Vine and the Branches 15 ""I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener. 2 He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful. 3 You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you. 4 Remain in me, and I will remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. 5 ""I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. 6 If anyone does not remain in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. 7 If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you. 8 This is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples."
Matthew 6:5-13,"('Prayer', ""Lord's Prayer"")",Wesleyan," When you Pray. I love the positive thought that comes across in the statement that Jesus made to the disciples in the book of Matthew. It is found in what we refer to as the Sermon on the Mount and Jesus says three words that reflect his positive belief in the people who will call themselves by his name. And those three words are ""When You Pray"". He didn't say ""If you pray"" he said ""When you pray"". And that reality is that we all pray. It has often been said ""There are no atheists in foxholes."" And there are very few atheists in emergency rooms either. I love the story of the two old guys talking after a really big storm went through and one said ""That was a mighty awful storm, wasn't it?"" To which his friend replied, ""Yep, I bet God heard a lot of unfamiliar voices last night."" I started this message on the cruise we were on last week and I was sitting outside the room of prayer on the ship. And you are thinking ""Do they have a chapel on the ship?"" Nope, they have a casino aboard the ship. And I would imagine that God hears a lot of promises and is offered all kinds of partnerships in that room. And so, Jesus began by telling us by telling us How Not to Pray Apparently, simply praying isn't enough. Jesus doesn't just say when you pray, he also says ""When you pray, don't. . ."" Don't what? Well first we are told in Matthew 6:5 ""When you pray, don't be like the hypocrites who love to pray publicly on street corners and in the synagogues where everyone can see them. I tell you the truth, that is all the reward they will ever get."" You see, Sometimes We Pray for The Wrong Reasons Apparently, and I can't imagine it happening today, but apparently there were folks who prayed to impress other people. It would seem that they prayed loud and they prayed eloquently, but it wasn't how they prayed, it was why they prayed. Their words were more directed to the people around them then to God. They wanted people to say or at least think, ""My, they pray well"". I'm sure it an apocryphal story, but I will tell it anyway. The story goes that many years ago that the pastor in one of our district churches was known for how long his pastoral prayers were and on one Sunday morning one of the professors from our bible college was in attendance in this man's church and after the service when he greeted the pastor he whispered, ""I'd recommend having your personal prayer time at home."" I don't know if it's a true story but it is a great story. The good news is that those folks get what they want, that is they get recognition for their prayers, the bad news is they might not get what they need and that is their prayers answered. A few years back I was asked to bring the benediction, that is the closing prayer. at the CPA graduation Ceremony. Another pastor was to pray the invocation, that is the opening prayer, and he prayed and prayed and prayed. And finished by calling on the name of Jesus, Allah and Krishna."
Psalms 61:1-3,"('Peace', 'God', 'Hidden', 'Overwhelmed')",Assembly Of God,salm 61:1," Lead ME to the Rock CCCAG March 5th, 2017 Intro- Beginning small series of messages about being ""hidden in God"" beginning today with studying Psalm 61. Background on this Psalm- (Why Chronological bible reading is important) It is written by King David of Israel. David had many children, from many wives, and this caused some friction within the home. His first-born son was named Amnon, and Amnon fell in love with his half-sister Tamar. Instead of pursuing a normal relationship with her which may have been blessed by David even if it was against the Law of Moses, he tricked Tamar into his bedroom by faking a sickness and forced himself upon her. After this horrible act was completed, he threw her out and wanted nothing to do with her. Her full brother Absalom, David's 3rd born son, found her- clothes torn, crying hysterically over what her half-brother had done. Absalom does nothing initially, but for 2 years is secretly plotting against Amnon until the time comes when he can kill him, which he does. Absalom fearing the King's judgment, flees to his grandfather's house for 3 years, until David relents and sends word that he has pardoned Absalom so he can return home. Absalom repays the kings forgiveness by leading a rebellion against David, causing David and most of his household to run for their lives into the desert where he ends up in a stronghold which is a series of caves that you can hide in from your enemies. Considering all of this- Put yourself in David's shoes for a moment as he is now alone, and face to face with what has happened under his watch as king- Your first-born son and heir to the throne is a rapist and his now dead- killed by the same son that is now trying to kill you. The same son that law and justice demanded be put to death for his crimes- yet you showed mercy and pardoned him. Because of your weakness and your laziness how you ran your kingdom, all of your officials and most of your army have apparently turned their backs on you and followed Absalom. All the people-your loyal subjects, who have loved you and supported your reign and rule have rebelled and installed Absalom as King. As a result, the Kingdom that God has promised you is now seemingly being ripped away from you. In one day, you've gone from living in the highest luxury as the most powerful man in the world at that time, to sleeping on a rock in a cave with barely a blanket to keep you warm. This is where David is at right now. David is filled with regret, torn apart by sorrow, and carrying the weight of his failures both as father and king, so as an act of worship and contrition, he writes this powerful Psalm to show us how to react when our worlds fall apart, and we are feeling overwhelmed. I'm going to break with my practice of using the NIV, and use the King James Version as I think it captures the beauty and poetry of the Psalms To the chief Musician upon Neginah, A Psalm of David. Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I. For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy."
Acts 2:41,"('Pentecost', 'Baptisim', '3000 Souls', 'Received His Word')",Baptist," August 29, 2013 By: Tom Lowe Series: The Early Church Title: 3,000 Saved Acts 2.41 (KJV) 41Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. Commentary Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: ""Then they that gladly received his word"" denotes that the Jews accepted Peter's doctrine with great joy and gladness, which he preached to them. The Syriac version adds, ""and believed,"" making it read, ""Then they that gladly received his word, and believed, were baptized."" That which they ""gladly received and believed"" was that which Peter said concerning repentance and baptism, and especially concerning the pardoning of sin through Jesus Christ, and the gift of the Holy Ghost; and concerning the promise of Christ, and salvation by him. They were ready and willing to receive the Gospel and the doctrine that went along with it; they were made a willing people in the day of God's power, and now that promise, or prophecy, in Psalm 110:3 had been accomplished in a remarkable manner--""Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth"" (Ps. 110.3). These Jewish converts were the dew of Christ's youth. The word ""youth"" denotes a period of life distinguished for strength and activity; the ""dew"" is a constant emblem of whatever is refreshing and strengthening. The Messiah, then, is pictured leading His people, who are represented as continually in the vigor of youth, refreshed and strengthened by the early dew of God's grace and Spirit. ""In the day of thy power,"" is a time when God's people freely offer themselves (Romans 12:1) in His service, and enlist under His banner; when there are instances of His powerful and effective grace. But not all that heard this sermon of Peter's received his doctrine in this manner, only some of them; and this is confirmed by the Syriac and Arabic versions where this clause is rendered, ""and some of them readily received"", which shows the discriminating grace of God in this instance. And as soon as they had received the word, and were gladdened and comforted by it, they were baptized; in water, by immersion, because there was plenty of water conveniently available in Jerusalem, and in the temple, where the apostles were now, in private houses, in the public baths, and in the numerous pools. Note the sequence of events; they were baptized and then added to the church and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. Those who acknowledged a readiness to embrace the offer of salvation were baptized on the same day. Their conversion was instantaneous. The appeal made to them was for them to immediately yield themselves to God; and they responded by making their profession of faith in Christ, and the ordinance which sealed their profession was administered without delay. The number of converts is given as ""three thousand souls (persons),"" who were added to the company of disciples, or to the followers of Christ. These 3000 persons left the scribes and Pharisees, and put themselves under the teaching of the apostles, professing the Christian doctrine and acknowledging that Christ was come, and that he who was recently crucified by the Jews was the promised and only Messiah; and in this faith they were baptized. They were baptized in the name of Jesus--""Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost"" (Acts 2:38)--because this was the condition of a Jew's conversion; and when a Jew had received baptism in this name he was excluded from all fellowship with his countrymen; and no man would have forfeited such privileges, who did not have the deepest and surest conviction. This baptism was a very powerful means to prevent their apostasy; they had, by receiving baptism in the name of Jesus, renounced Judaism, and all the political advantages connected with it; and they found it indispensably necessary to make the best use of that holy religion which they had received in its place."
1 Corinthians 11:23-26,"('Communion', 'Holy Communion', 'Embrace Forgiveness')",Lutheran," ""We're having a potluck next week. Please plan accordingly!"" What's your reaction when you see such an announcement in the church bulletin? Are you among those who loves potlucks because you enjoy jamming your plate with two different kinds of salads, perogies nestled against cabbage rolls, meatballs nudging a slice of lasagna on which is balanced a dinner roll and a deviled egg--and then in your other hand is your dessert plate piled high with goodies because you know that Mom won't say anything since she's not paying attention? Or do you let out a little sigh when you hear there's going to be a potluck because now you have to prepare a dish late Saturday night or early Sunday morning and you had just wanted to relax on the weekend? Sure, potlucks are fun, but they do take a little work. That's why we don't have them every Sunday. We do however gather for another meal here at church much more frequently. And I hope that you have no reservations about it. It's not a fancy meal or even particularly filling, but it is so much more satisfying than the best church potluck. This Sunday we're starting a four-part series on the sacrament of Holy Communion and we'll discover today how Holy Communion is way better than a potluck. As an outline for this series we're going to follow Martin Luther's four-part explanation of Holy Communion. In answer to the question: ""What is Holy Communion?"" Luther, wrote: ""It is the true body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ under the bread and wine, instituted by Christ for us Christians to eat and to drink."" Luther's explanation is not highly regarded by non-Lutheran Protestants who say that Jesus' body and blood are not really on the menu--just bread and wine. Nor would Roman Catholics agree that the bread and wine are only to be consumed, not worshipped or venerated because the priest has permanently turned it into Jesus' body and blood. So how did Luther come up with this explanation, and why do we agree with it? Because Luther took seriously what the Apostle Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians. ""For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, 24 and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, 'This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.' 25 In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.' 26 For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes"" (1 Corinthians 11:23-26). Paul had to share the basics about Holy Communion with the Christians in Corinth because they had forgotten that it was the Lord's Supper and not their own. What was happening in that congregation is that Holy Communion seemed to be celebrated during the fellowship meal after the service. It might seem strange to us to have Holy Communion during a potluck after the service, but it's the way they did it. There was nothing wrong with that except there didn't seem to be a holy reverence for the sacrament. In fact, by the time some got around to receiving Communion, they were already drunk from the wine they had brought to the fellowship meal (1 Corinthians 11:21)! To make matters worse, the fellowship meal wasn't really a potluck. People didn't share their food. So some feasted while others had nothing to eat."
"Genesis 2:15-17, Genesis 3:1-7, Romans 5:12-19","('Forgiveness General', ""God's Forgiveness"", ""God's Generosity"", 'Satan Lies', 'Fall Of Man')",Baptist," Genesis 2:15-17; 3:1-7 Paradise Lost ""Genesis"" means ""beginnings."" This first book of the Bible introduces us to the beginning of creation and lots of other things. Today we'll look at ""The Fall,"" the beginning of sin and all that goes wrong with the world. It would be nice to blame Adam and Eve, our first parents, but if we're truthful, we all find a way to rebel against God from time to time. G. K. Chesterton put it another way when he said, ""There is only one doctrine that can be empirically verified: the doctrine of original sin."" We have all tested it as we have each sinned against God. But we'll also see that God is not surprised by the first couple's fall from grace, nor from ours. Indeed, he has had a solution to our sin problem from the very beginning. In fact, when we look at the story of ""Paradise Lost,"" we discover something important about God, something important about Satan, and something important ourselves. First, let's start with God: we see in this story that God wants to bless us with everything we need, including himself. He told the first man, ""Feel free to eat of any tree in the garden of Eden, any tree that is, except one."" Healthy protective love gives boundaries. Some people say, ""Why did God even plant that tree of the knowledge of good and evil if he knew Adam and Eve would choose it despite his warning?"" From the very beginning, God allowed his children the ability to disobey, for without that, how can one freely obey? And what kind of a relationship would he have with them if he compelled their obedience? Now compare what God gave them with what he declared off limits: they could enjoy many, many trees with wonderful fruit, but would need to avoid just one tree. The Hebrew conveys very empathically in Genesis 2:16, ""You may freely eat;"" today we might say, ""Eat to your heart's content."" The New King James Study Bible notes, God gives ""permission before restriction."" We have a generous God. Sometimes we focus only on his restrictions, thinking he holds back all the fun stuff. Yet, the Bible says his commands are not burdensome, but are for our own good. And we're like the child who sulks because Dad won't let us play in the road, even though we have a large fenced yard all around us. Consider all the blessings God gave this first couple. Not only did they have lots of food, they had productive work--to take care of the garden; they had God's presence as he walked with them in the cool of the day; and they had all this forever, as indicated by the Tree of Life. They had everything they needed. They of all people should have been most grateful. Yet they were not content. Instead of focusing on what they did have, they focused on the one thing they did not have. Instead of trusting God and his word, they trusted the word of a creature we now know as Satan. The Bible calls him the devil, the father of all lies (John 8:44), the accuser of the brethren (Revelation 12:10). And we see him here, the craftiest of all the creatures, misleading Eve with half-truths and outright lies."
"Ecclesiastes 1:2-4, Ecclesiastes 12:13-14","('Fulfillment', 'Meaning Of Life', 'Purpose For Life', 'Spirit & Truth')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Series: Chasing the Wind - Ecclesiastes Transition read before song: Solomon states in Ecc. 1:2-4; 8; 14: ""Meaningless! MEANINGLESS!"" SAYS THE TEACHER. ""UTTERLY MEANINGLESS!"" Everything Is meaningless."" What does man gain from his labor at which he toils under the sun? Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever... all things are wearisome ... I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind!"" Beth/Tony plays Jaye Thomas song: For your glory/send the winds. (key lyrics - God send you winds of refreshing - God send your Spirit - God send you glory down! God send your winds!) Introduction to Series: Chasing Illustration Kites - Kites set up in sanctuary- We need to catch the wind if we want to sail into the spiritual realm and to find meaning and purpose for our lives. Just like kites need to catch the wind to sail. Thesis of series: Catching the wind of the Holy Spirit (The Spirit of God) is crucial to finding purpose and fulfillment in life - you can chase the wind of life all you want but it won't make you fly - just like chasing the wind will not make a kite fly - you have to catch the wind to sail - to soar - too fly high in the both the natural and spiritual realm of life. Back to Solomon words in Ecc. 1:2-4; 8; 14: ""Meaningless! MEANINGLESS!"" SAYS THE TEACHER. ""UTTERLY MEANINGLESS!"" Everything Is meaningless."" What does man gain from his labor at which he toils under the sun? Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever... all things are wearisome ... I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind! Wow Solomon sounds like Mr. Doom and Gloom! He could be saying it this way, ""We suffer through life and then we just die!"" ""Life has no purpose no satisfaction!"" ""It's pointless!"" Wow I don't know about you but this guy sounds deeply depressed about his life! Solomon the king starts out this book with bad news - with a hopeless view of life. I thought he was suppose to be the wise one? He is he is really painting a picture for you of a life that counts for something and a life that is meaningless - he uses his own life as the spiritual example. You have to hang with Solomon through the journey because in the end he adds this thought! Note: Here is a book which should be started in the last chapter so you read and understand the reason behind this book and the meaning in life - Here are his final thoughts on life and its true meaning and purpose after his spiritual experiment - he says, ""I was wise and I sought knowledge and fulfillment in everything you could imagine in life - I was highlighted as one, who is a whose who, of the rich and famous! - I had the resources to try everything so I did! - I mean everything! - and it was all meaningless - a chasing after the wind - empty - void of fulfillment! I tried work, riches, pleasure, possessions and did it without God and found it all meaningless! Solomon concludes with these penetrating words after his spiritual journey of life with and without God by his side:"
Revelation 19:11-16,"('Righteous Judgment', ""Jesus' Return"")",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," He's Our Hero Riding To The Rescue Revelation 19: 11-16 11 Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war. 12His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns. He had a name written that no one knew except Himself. 13He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God. 14And the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him on white horses. 15Now out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it He should strike the nations. And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron. He Himself treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. 16And He has on His robe and on His thigh a name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS. When I was a boy, my favorite TV program was the Lone Ranger. Riding his white horse Silver, the Lone Ranger always rode in to defeat the bad guys. Today we meet another Hero riding on a white horse. He, too, will come to defeat the bad guys. In today's passage, we find the triumphal redeemed saints in the heavenly procession with the King of Kings. Jesus comes to make war on Satan, the Antichrist, the False Prophet, and the kings of the earth. When this war with Satan is over, Jesus becomes the absolute ruler of the earth. Verse 11 Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war. This begins the description of our Lord's return. First, it will be obvious. Jesus said in Matthew 24:27 For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. Everybody will see it. It will occur immediately after the Great Tribulation. Second, a door opened in heaven. This opening of heaven is not to go in. It is the opening for Jesus and His followers to come out. The door to heaven has been open for Christians to enter in. Now the door becomes an Exit. Jesus rides a ""white horse"". Back in chapter 6 we read about the Antichrist coming forth to begin his conquering efforts in the world. He, too, was seen riding a white horse. Jesus comes riding a white horse because He comes to conquer. The words ""Faithful and True"" in our Bibles. That lets us know that this is God the Son. He is always faithful to His promises. What He speaks is always true. Notice the last part of Verse 1: and in righteousness He judges and makes war. Jesus will come as both a judge and warrior. His judgment of the earth will be totally righteous. Psalm 96:13 says, For He is coming, for He is coming to judge the earth. He shall judge the world with righteousness, And the peoples with His truth. We are assured that His judgments are right. He has been sitting at the Right Hand of the Father in heaven, but now He is about to set up His kingdom here on the earth. The most detailed description of the Second Coming was given by Jesus in Matthew chapter 24. Matthew 24:29-31 ""Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 30Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 31And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other."
Luke 22:14-30,"('Passover', 'Service To God', 'Passover Meal', 'Sacrifice Of Jesus', 'Suffering Christ')",Baptist," The Echoes of Easter Pt 1 ""His Cup at the Gathering"" Luke 22:14-30 Luke 22:14 And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him. 15 And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: 16 For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. 17 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves: 18 For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come. 19 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me. 20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you. 21 But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table. 22 And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed! 23 And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing. 24 And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest. 25 And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors. 26 But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. 27 For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth. 28 Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations. 29 And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me; 30 That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. Introduction: Over the next 7 weeks we will be examining the pre and post resurrection events surrounding the last days of Jesus Christ on earth. The title of this series is, ""The Echoes of Easter,"" and I am praying that the Lord would use these messages to bless you and your family. If you would like to do some background Scripture reading then I would encourage and challenge you to read through Luke chapters 22-24 once per week over the next seven weeks and make plans to be present for the entire series. To use a common metaphor, the Scriptures are a spiritual banquet but you must come to the ""table"" to eat! Our message begins with the phrase, ""And when the hour was come..."" Question: What does this mean? Exodus 12:6 And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening. The hour spoken of by the Lord is about 6 PM which would have been the time for the Pascal Lamb to be sacrificed. But there was another reference to the time in the mind of the Lord. If you recall from reading the NT, Jesus mentioned on several occasions that His hour was not yet come. Listen as I read this sequence of verses from John's Gospel..."
John 4:43-54,"('Dad', 'Father', 'Communion', 'Worship', 'Decision', 'Commitment', 'Son', 'Wealth', 'Believe', 'Dying', 'Herod', 'Rebuke', 'King', 'Political', 'Inheritance', 'Lottery', 'Boat', 'Cana', 'Capernaum', 'Proclaim', 'Galilee', 'Boring', 'Doing', 'Realization', 'Harsh', 'Authority', 'Official', 'Wonders', 'Turning Point', 'Max Lucado', 'Hymns', 'Church Building', 'Judea', 'Sign', 'Spiritual Atm', 'Press Secretary', 'Confronted', 'Sean Spicer', 'Sanctified Imaginato', 'Imaginator', 'Galveston', 'Twenty Miles', 'Clout', 'Subordinate', 'Chair', 'Aha')",Christian/Church Of Christ," OPEN: An instructor was conducting a seminar for executives and focusing on the topic of decision making. So he started out telling the story of 5 frogs sitting on a log. ""Four of the frogs decide to jump into the water. How many frogs are there left on the log?"" The class almost unanimously responded: ONE ""No,"" the instructor smiled. ""All of them are still on the log. Deciding is different than doing."" Our story this morning, tells about this idea of people making decisions. Just to give you a little background. Jesus has just left the Samaria a couple days before where he met with a woman at a well and now He has returned to Cana where He did His 1st sign in Galilee. No sooner does He get there than a man approaches Him. The man's son is dying and he has traveled 20 miles to see Jesus and ask Him to heal his child. As I first looked at this text I was a little shocked by Jesus' first words. John 4:48 tells us ""So Jesus said to him, 'Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.'"" And I'm thinking to myself... that's pretty harsh! This man's son is dying. He's walked 20 miles to see Jesus - and Jesus rebukes him? I figured there was something here that I wasn't seeing here, because this didn't make any sense at all. Why would Jesus say something like THIS to a grieving father! So I looked it up in the Greek and found that while Jesus addressed the father, He wasn't saying (to the dad) YOU will not believe unless you see signs and wonders, He was saying YOU'ALL will not believe... unless you see signs and wonders. It was plural. Jesus was talking to everyone who was there. (Depending on your English version the translation will either make that clear in the text, or will put a footnote at the bottom of the page explaining this). What Jesus says is here is - they weren't really believing in Him. All they seem to want are signs and wonders --- but no commitment. They wanted WHAT Jesus could give... but they didn't want Jesus Himself. ILLUS: Think about it this way. Have you ever of someone buying a boat... and then suddenly they have lots of friends? Or have you heard of folks who've come into a large inheritance or win the lottery... and suddenly everybody seems to want to spend time with them. If it had been you that bought the boat or came into money you'd know something was wrong. Those ""so-called friends"" were there ONLY for the advantages they can get from you. You'd soon realize that they didn't want you for YOU... they wanted you for what you could give them. That's what's happening here. These folks don't really want Jesus, they want what Jesus can GIVE them. So everybody there... including the dad... was there for what they could get from Jesus. You see, Jesus has a reputation. He did that miracle at the wedding feast here at Cana - water into wine and everyone knows about it. And then there was what He did at Jerusalem. John 4:45 tells us ""the Galileans (at Cana) welcomed him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast. For they too had gone to the feast."" Dwight Morgan commented on Apr 1, 2017 Great message.

Philippians 2:5-11,"('Incarnation', ""Christ's Obedience"", 'God In Jesus', 'Humility Service')",Christian/Church Of Christ," ""Jesus Wins The Best Everything!"" Philippians 2:5-11 David P. Nolte I'm not ""into"" the Oscar thing or the Emmy thing or the Pulitzer Prize thing. They are not quite as exciting to me as watching grass grow. These matter greatly to some but I'd have more fun sitting there watching paint dry. However, ""To each his own."" To Whom belongs the highest award? Who deserves the loftiest acclaim? For Whom should we stand and applaud? You know the answer to that! Of course it is Jesus Christ! Let's check the Scripture to see why God gave Jesus the highest award! HIGHER THAN ANY OSCAR, EMMY OR PRIZE OF ANY SORT! ""Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."" Philippians 2:5-11 (NASB). So, with God the Father, we accord to God the Son these awards: I. THE AWARD FOR BEST HUMILITY: A. The Text says: 1. He emptied Himself: That does not mean He divested Himself of deity. He emptied, or poured Himself out, as God into human flesh. a. It's like pouring milk from a pitcher into a glass - it's still milk but in another container and another shape. b. John tells us that The Word was God and the Word became flesh an dwelt among us. John 1:1-14. c. Paul tells us that all the fulness of God dwelt in Him in the human body. Colossians 1:19 & 2:9. d. Hebrews tells us that He is the exact image of God. Hebrews 1:3. 2. He did not selfishly cling to that equality but He humbled Himself: a. He was not coerced but willingly became lower than the angels for a time. b. He willingly put off the Royal Robes of Heaven to put on the robe of a peasant carpenter and itinerant preacher. B. Jesus said, ""Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light."" Matthew 11:28-30 (NASB). 1. An arrogant Lord would send us away; the lowly Jesus calls us to Himself. 2. The Lordly often impose heavy burdens on their subjects - Jesus invites us to rest and a light load. C. Contrast the humble Jesus with the arrogant gods of Mythology: 1. Athena was furious when she heard about a woman named Arachne, who boasted she was better at weaving than the goddess herself. So she challenged the mortal and lost, and was so mad she turned Arcahne into a spider."
Matthew 6:25-34,"('Peace Be Still', 'Priorities Faith', 'Worry And Anxiety', 'Seek The Kingdom Of Good')",Baptist," DO NOT WORRY Online Sermon: http://www.mckeesfamily.com/?page_id=3567 Living in a society where time is more precious than either gold or silver, taking time to be holy tends to be one of those commands that is truly forgotten. While most Canadians have their basic needs met most of our society still feel like they live a life of poverty. Until we have acquired what the general populace has we tend to feel like we are destitute and poor. To satisfy the cravings of what our eyes see we borrow vast sums of money so that we can buy the lifestyle that we covet. Ironically, our debts are so vast that rarely do we get time to enjoy the things we have purchased. When God comes knocking at our door and asks us to spend time with Him our response is to give Him a few hours a week and foolishly claim it a living sacrifice unto God. This sermon will explore how much better our walk with God would be if only we would seek first the kingdom of God, stop coveting and leave Him responsible to provide for our basic needs. ILLUSTRATION #1 To start off this sermon I had two ladies perform what I would like to call the ""Frantic Worrier Skit."" They both entered the sanctuary with curlers in their hair and clothing that looked like it was taken right out of the dryer and thrown onto their bodies with little thought. As they enter the sanctuary the song Crazy Frog Axel F played in the background to set the ""I am too busy"" tone. As both ladies hurried up the aisle they frantically talked about their insane schedules and how they are sinking fast! When they arrive at the front of the church they sat at a table. They were waiting for others to arrive for the church Business meeting. The longer they waited the more they talked about their schedules and the more frantic they became. They got so flustered that they both agreed to skip the church meeting and on the way out the door they justified their leaving by saying that God wanted them to catch up anyways. WORRYING LEADS AND A FRANTIC LIFE 25 ""Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? Matthew 6:25, NIV While this skit was humorous and very entertaining the main reason for including it in the sermon was to accentuate the point that busyness is often the by-product of fear for one's very life. Every Christian is painfully aware of the curse ""from dust you are, dust you will return"" (Genesis 3:19). From the first time one skinned one's knee, had a tooth fall out, got sick or had to bury a family member; one soon came to realize that God's curse was not just words but reality. The body is frail and without the necessities of life of food, water, shelter and clothing; we know the it will perish. Abraham Maslov states that until we fully feel like these basic needs are met then every ounce of our effort will be devoted to our physical survival. The good news is that most people living in Canada have their basic needs met. While there are places such as Chad, Haiti, Liberia, Congo, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Zimbabwe have poverty levels ranging from 68 to 80% of the population, here in Canada the poverty level is only about 9%. While this number is significant, one must be carful in how one defines poverty. For instance, the poverty threshold for the U.S. for a family of two adults and two children is an annual income of less than $24,339 whereas in India it is $20,000 rupees which is the equivalent of about $400 Canadian dollars. Furthermore, having to dig through the garbage heaps of Calcutta to be fed is certainly different than going to a food bank here in Canada. This country has been truly blessed with social assistance programs that make sure the basic necessities of life are provided to the populace."

Such things are earthly, unspiritual, and demonic. 16 For wherever there is jealousy and selfish ambition, there you will find disorder and evil of every kind. 17 But the wisdom from above is first of all pure. It is also peace loving, gentle at all times, and willing to yield to others. It is full of mercy and the fruit of good deeds. It shows no favoritism and is always sincere. 18 And those who are peacemakers will plant seeds of peace and reap a harvest of righteousness. Many in today's world confuse knowledge and wisdom Someone can have vast amounts of knowledge and lack wisdom Let me explain In a worldly view We all know someone who is so smart on a subject That it should be against the law But When it comes to actually doing the thing they have so much knowledge about They are completely incompetent From a spiritual point We all know people who are masters at scripture memorization They can quote chapter and verse of more of the bible than Billy Graham When it comes to applying the word to their lives Or helping apply it to the lives of others Not so wise Many times those people Know about a subject"

In what has been called the most shocking moment in the history of the Academy Awards, the Oscar for ""best picture"" was inadvertently awarded to the wrong movie. It turns out that the presenters, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, were given the wrong envelope. This got pretty awkward when the filmmakers for the wrong movie began their acceptance speech for an award they had not won. The mistake wasn't fixed for two and half minutes before the correct winner was called to the stage to receive the award. Apparently, the head guy with PriceWaterhouseCoopers, the longtime accounting firm for the Oscars, was so struck by all the celebrities surrounding him that he was tweeting pictures of himself with various stars just minutes before the mix-up. Many things kept him from the one thing. He has since lost his gig at the Oscars and is now receiving death threats. Something's out of whack there, isn't it? In our passage today, we're going to see two awkward moments in which those who look to be the least are celebrated as the winners and then we'll focus on a celebrity who ends up losing everything because many things kept him from the one thing. Last weekend we learned that marriage matters to the Master as we drilled down into the importance of leaving, cleaving, and weaving so that we don't cause grieving. It's no accident that the very next passage deals with children. Malachi 2:15 links the importance of marital unity and the raising of godly children: ""Did he not make them one, with a portion of the Spirit in their union? And what was the one God seeking? Godly offspring. So guard yourselves in your spirit, and let none of you be faithless to the wife of your youth."" Turn to Mark 10:13-16 where we see Jesus demonstrating four attitudes and actions towards children. 1. Bring your children to Jesus. Look at verse 13: ""And they were bringing children to Him that He might touch them..."" The idea here is that parents were continuously bringing their kids to Jesus, wanting Jesus to connect with them in a very personal way. We know from Luke 18:15 that this included infants. Parents and grandparents, do all you can to bring your children and grandchildren to Jesus. Pray for them every day. Read the Bible to them. Bring them to church and to AWANA and to Super Saturdays. Sheila and her team have put together a very moving Easter experience called, ""The Road to Resurrection."" Kids 5 years through 6th grade will travel the path Jesus journeyed during the days of His death, burial, and resurrection. They'll taste the Passover meal, visit Barabbas in his jail cell, listen to a Roman soldier's remorse, and hear an account of seeing the risen Savior from one of the men on the road to Emmaus. There will be music, drama, puppets, and an Easter gift bag for each child. 3-and 4-year-olds will have an Easter program and there will also be a nursery for all five services. It would be great if you could worship in one service with your guest and work in another. You can sign up through the digital bulletin on your app or stop by the child check-in desk."
Jeremiah 20:9,"('Faith', 'Discouragement', 'Commitment To Christ', 'Enduring Hardship')",Baptist," Compelled to Continue Jeremiah 20:9 The life and ministry of Jeremiah was interesting to say the least. He is commonly known as the ""Weeping Prophet,"" and for good reason. His ministry spanned forty years in Judah, leading up to their captivity at the hands of the Babylonians. During his faithful ministry, Jeremiah was the lone voice of truth and righteousness among a people who had no desire for righteousness. While Jeremiah remained faithful to his calling, his efforts appeared to be of little value or benefit. After forty years of ministry, he failed to secure one convert to truth and righteousness. (How many today would continue forty weeks, much less forty years with no tangible results to show for their efforts?) Rather than being encouraged and followed in righteousness, Jeremiah faced extreme opposition and difficulty. He was impoverished, imprisoned, ridiculed, and even cast into a muddy cistern to die, all at the hands of his countrymen. Such treatment was Judah's response and compensation for their national pastor. (At the time of our text, Jeremiah had been faithfully proclaiming the truth of God to a rebellious people for approximately thirty years.) While we are not prophets, called to warn a rebellious people of judgment to come, I am sure we have all experienced seasons in life when we could relate to Jeremiah's feelings. As we strive to serve the Lord and live for Him, we face opposition, often from those we least expect. If you have served the Lord for any length of time, you have likely been tempted to abandon the work, questioning if the effort was really worth it. If you are walking in a valley of doubt and despair, I hope the message today will bring the comfort and encouragement you need to continue for the Lord. Let's consider these particular aspects in the life of Jeremiah as we think on the thought: Compelled to Continue. I. The Reflection of Jeremiah (9a) - Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. As Jeremiah reflected on nearly thirty years of ministry, faithfully serving the Lord, this is the attitude he possessed at that moment in life. He was at the bottom of the barrel, so to speak, and felt as if he could not go on another day. This statement represents emotions that many of us have felt at one point or another. We may not have verbalized them as Jeremiah did, but we have felt the heaviness of despair and questioned our ability to move on. As we consider where Jeremiah was at this moment we discover: A. He felt Deceived (7a) - O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: These are clearly strong words, but they are spoken from a heart of honesty before the Lord. God already knew how Jeremiah felt and he just verbalized his feelings unto the Lord. He honestly felt as if he had been deceived by the Lord. He revealed his displeasure with his current situation. He felt as if the Lord had not revealed unto him the great difficulty he would face. He had hoped for better success, and yet he faced one defeat after another. He was saying, ""Lord, why have you brought me to this place; this is not what I expected when you spoke to me about preaching unto the people. This is not what I signed up for."""
"1 Corinthians 12:1, Galatians 5:22-23","('Fruit Of The Spirit', 'Holy Spirit Filling', 'Fruit Of Holy Spirit')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," The Workings of the Holy Spirit: Character and Gifts - March 5, 2017 When I was 16 years old, I had been living with serious depression for three years. I was using a lot of marijuana, which was only numbing the pain. It wasn't helping me make any progress in life. So I was pretty sad. At night time, I would sit on my bed and lean on the windowsill of the third-floor bedroom window at the back of my parents house. It was dark outside, and I would look at a porch light that was perhaps for houses east of ours. I would talk into the air about my anxieties and fears and sadness. This became something I did nearly every night. After a number of weeks doing this, I would finish my times doing this by saying: ""I say this to the Lord inside"". After a few more weeks, doing this most every night, I would finish what I was doing and I would say: ""I pray this to the Lord inside"". You have to understand, I was not a believer in anything. I was far from being a Christian, from believing in God, far from any type of faith, or so I thought. So, what was that? Just a bizarre, strange thing for my father's youngest kid to do? No, that was the Holy Spirit wooing me. The Holy Spirit, who I had zero clue even existed was working in my life. Flash forward three years. When I was 19, it had been two years since I excepted Christ into my life. I struggled with a lot of questions and doubt, as I'd been raised to have a very skeptical view of anything to do with God. It didn't help that my family was relentless in trying to ""unconvert"" me. They thought I had joined a cult or was otherwise on a very dangerous road, being a Christian. One night I went with some friends to an event where The speaker was talking about the Holy Spirit. He was talking about the work of the Holy Spirit, and the gifts of the Holy Spirit. This was pretty much new information for me. At one point there was an invitation to go forward and be prayed for. So after a while, I went forward. The pastor prayed for me, and prayed that I would receive an infilling of the Holy Spirit. I began to speak in tongues, for the first time. It was sort of weird, sort of incredibly peaceful. I was worshiping and I was praying and I was fixed on Jesus. After that, every single doubt that I had entertained about Jesus, about the Christian faith, evaporated. If I had doubts anymore, they were doubts about myself, never about God. What was that? Just some emotional experience? A fleeting, passing event that was to have no impact on my life? No. It was the work of the Holy Spirit, bringing, along with one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, an incredibly deep and profound conviction about the truth of Jesus, the truth of the Bible and the importance of being a follower of Jesus. I haven't looked back in 37 years. March 15 will be my 37th year as a Christ follower. So no, it wasn't a fleeting experience. For the last Number of weeks we have been spending quite a bit of time looking at the Way of Jesus markers. A number of us met a few Wednesdays ago for an introductory evening about the Way of Jesus platform, and those who are interested will be attending three Saturday sessions, one in April, one of May and one in June."
Luke 15:1-7,"('Evangelism', 'Lost Sheep', 'Good Shepherd', 'Seek & Save The Lost')",Baptist," Your Life Matters to God! Luke 15:1-7 Sermon by Rick Crandall Grayson Baptist Church - Feb. 26, 2017 *In 1905, a box was shipped from South Africa to England. There was nothing special looking about this box. It was just an ordinary shipping box. And inside the box was a rock, but it was no ordinary rock. The rock was a diamond, ""The Cullinan Diamond,"" the world's largest diamond, weighing 3,106 carats! It was a present for King Edward VII on his 66th birthday. (1) *Well, we may look ordinary on the outside, and you may feel very ordinary today. But your life is incredibly valuable to the King of Kings! Your life is more valuable to God than a diamond as big as the sun! And in today's Scripture, Jesus reminds us that all of our lives matter to God. 1. We know this first of all, because Jesus came for us. *Jesus Christ came to seek and to save all of us. He came ""to seek and to save that which was lost.'' That's what the Lord said in Luke 19:10 on the day Zacchaeus got saved. And that's what the Lord illustrated in today's Scripture *Little Zacchaeus was a hated, and corrupt tax collector. He seemed to be a hopeless case. Everybody who knew him would have said so. But Zacchaeus got saved when he met Jesus Christ! *He seemed like a hopeless case, but the Lord didn't give up on Zacchaeus. And Christians: The Lord didn't give up on us! Jesus cared enough to seek for us when we were lost, and He didn't give up! He kept seeking for us until He found us. This is the message of hope and joy we hear in the parable of the lost sheep. *In vs. 1-4, God's Word says: 1. Then all the tax collectors and the sinners drew near to Him to hear Him. 2. And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, ""This man receives sinners and eats with them.'' 3. So He spoke this parable to them, saying: 4. ""What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?"" *That one lost sheep in vs. 4 represents every person who has ever lived, except Jesus Christ. That lost sheep represents us, for Isaiah 53:6 says, ""All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned, every one, to his own way . . ."" *By our sinful ways, we wandered away from God. We were cut-off from God's flock. And we were in the greatest danger. But Jesus Christ is the Good Shepherd who came looking for us. He made a passionate, sacrificial search for you! *Jesus was absolutely determined to find us. He cared so much that He went the distance for you. How far was Jesus willing to go? How far did He go? -- Even into this world, and that's a long way down from Heaven! Jesus went the distance, even to the suffering of the cross, and even into death for us. *Anthony Fortosis described Jesus' all-out effort with these words: -""Jesus is the King of kings, -Lord of the infinite universe, -Omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, -Unspeakably holy, -Dwelling in light, unapproachable, changeless. -And yet He condescended to become enclosed in lowly human flesh,"
Mark 1:14-20,"('Call', 'Commitment', 'Discipleship')",Assembly Of God," THE MASTER'S CALL Mk. 1:14-20 INTRODUCTION A. HUMOR: Career planning 1. One Sunday morning, as the Bubba Rathbone family were driving home from First Assembly after a great service where their Pastor really preached a great message, 9 year old Sam said to his father Bubba, ""When I grow up, dad, I've decided to be a Preacher."" 2. ""Well Sam,"" said Bubba, ""I have no problem with that. But tell me, why have you now decided to be a Pastor? You were going to be a football player last week."" 3. ""I know I was,"" replied Sam, ""but during the church service I realized that I'm going to be going to church every Sunday for the rest of my life - and that's a long time. So I decided that it would be funner to be standing and shouting than just sitting and listening!"" 4. That's not the ideal way to get a 'call.' Here's a better way... B. TEXT 14 Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came to Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, 15 and saying, ""The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel."" 16 And as He walked by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. 17 Then Jesus said to them, ""Follow Me, and I will make you become fishers of men."" 18 They immediately left their nets and followed Him. 19 When He had gone a little farther from there, He saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets. 20 And immediately He called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after Him. C. THESIS 1. Jesus, if you meet Him, is the answer to all your searching. In Him you'll find fulfillment, purpose, and the love of God. Real men/women will follow Christ when they meet Him. 2. Mt. 20:16 says, ""Many are called, but few are chosen."" From our standpoint, this means, ""Many are called, but few really respond to that call."" 3. AN EXAMPLE: RICH YOUNG RULER a. He was called by Christ to follow Him. But he was reluctant to give up his comfortable lifestyle. He would not respond to the Master's Call. 4. We're going to look at the nature, purpose & authority of Jesus' call. The title of this message is ""The Master's Call."" I. THE NATURE OF THE CALL A. MADE TO ORDINARY PEOPLE 1. Jesus found Peter, Andrew, James & John. 2. WERE ORDINARY PEOPLE: a. NOT TRAINED - Scribes, Levites, Priests b. NOT RABBIS - not even Pharisees, Sadducees c. But people like you & me. d. Jesus wasn't looking for the elite, the educated, the brilliant, the Barbie & Ken's of this world. Listen... 3. 1 Cor. 1:26; ""For you see your calling, brethren, that not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called."" B. HE CALLS BUSY PEOPLE 1. WHAT JESUS CALLED: a. Fishermen, busy running their business, planning their future, setting goals... b. Yet Christ called them in the midst of their busy-ness! c. James & John had their father Zebedee & hired servants - and were partners with Peter & Andrew. They had a booming business corporation going!"
Matthew 13:44-46,"('Treasure', 'Pearl', 'Worth Of Jesus')",Assembly Of God," THE PEARL OF GREATEST PRICE Matt. 13:44-46 INTRODUCTION A. HUMOR: Too Many Kids -- Katlyn Yoder 1. Desperate for a child, a couple asked their priest to pray for them. ""I'm going on sabbatical to Rome,"" he replied. ""I'll light a candle in St. Peter's for you."" 2. When the priest returned three years later, he found the wife pregnant, tending two sets of twins. Elated, the priest asked to speak to her husband and congratulate him. 3. ""He's gone to Rome,"" came the wife's response, ""to blow out that candle."" B. TEXT 44 ""The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field. 45 ""Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. 46 When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it. C. THE VALUE OF A PEARL 1. Pearls in the first century were viewed much like diamonds are today. They were the most valuable gem in the world at that time. If you owned a pearl, you owned a fortune. 2. And there was a good reason for it. The fine quality pearls are obtained from the pearl oyster, which thrives at an average depth of 40 feet. Many people died while pearl hunting. 3. A first century pearl diver would tie a large rock to his body and jump over the side of a little boat, allowing the weight of the rock to carry him down to the oyster beds. He risked danger from sharks, moray eels and other predators to scour the mud below for oysters. 4. An average of only one oyster in a thousand contain a pearl. All the while, he had to hold his breath and hope he wouldn't drown. You can see why pearls were so precious. The Jewish Talmud said, ""pearls are beyond price."" D. THE WISDOM OF THIS MERCHANT 1. The job of pearl merchants was to make a profit. They didn't plan to gain their wealth by the sweat of their brow, but by the sweat of their brains. They depended on knowledge, skill, and beating their competition to the untapped markets. 2. The pearl merchant in this parable presents many parallels to a person who is seeking after Christ. Christ and salvation are not earned as a result of labor; instead, Christ is gained by knowledge, discovery. 3. To know Christ and surrender to him is to know eternal life. Just as this merchant found something that was of immense value, so the finding of Christ is the discovery of that which is of ultimate value. E. THESIS This pearl merchant did four things; first, he sought; next, he found; third, he sold his accumulated wealth; and lastly, he obtained his goal by buying. I. HIS SEEKING ""Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls."" A. SEEKING ON PURPOSE 1. This merchant is very different from the man in the previous verses who, by accident, discovered a treasure while he was in a field. This merchant is of a nobler sort. He is searching for quality pearls when he happens to find the pearl of infinite price. 2. Notice, his mind is engaged in thinking about pearls. All his energies are thrown into the pursuit of pearls. He is not wasting time, playing video games, sleeping his life away, or turning his brain into mush watching television."
John 13:11-19,"('Judas Iscariot', 'Lent Sermon', 'Failed Life')",Assembly Of God," Judas Iscariot The man who betrayed Jesus. Matt.10:2-4 Of all the characters who march across the stage of Bible history, there is none so tragic nor so despicable as that of Judas Iscariot Judas background. His last name meant ""a man of Kerioth."" This is significant because all of the other Apostles were from Galilee in the north, whereas he was from the south. We know nothing of Judas prior to his call by Jesus. However to have been called as an apostle implies that he had previously declared himself a disciple. In any case it is probable Judas was among those who received the call to apostleship - Mark 3:13-19. Jesus, being able to read the hearts of Men (John 2: 25) selected His apostles with care. Judas probably had talents and gifts comparable to the other eleven and due to that supposed fact, his call was not a matter of surprise to them, nor did they think it strange. The life of Judas serves as a warning about the dangers of wasted opportunities, hardness of heart, wicked lusts, and spiritual carelessness. Judas played his part so well that no one but Jesus Himself knew that Judas was a fraud. He was a false follower and no one ever noticed! Why did Jesus choose Judas? Did Jesus know about him? A. Jesus never did anything by accident. Jesus chose him on purpose, knowing what would happen all the while. Judas did not trick Jesus. John 13:21-27 shows that Jesus knew all about Judas. B. To fulfill scripture's prophecy 1. Psalms 41:9 Scripture says that the Messiah will be betrayed 2. Zechariah 11:12&13 Scripture says that it will be for 30 pieces of silver C. To prove his Deity - John 13: 18-19 ""if it happens the way scripture says, I am the Messiah"" D. He chose him to show that the church can overcome tragedy and divisiveness. John 16:32-33 ""Indeed the hour is coming, yes, has now come, that you will be scattered, each to his own, and will leave me alone. And yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation, but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world"" What is clear in Scriptures is that Judas really chose what he did and he bears responsibility for his choice. Judas had the same exact stimulus as all the other 11. He could easily have turned out like Peter or James or John or Thomas. He saw the same things. There is one secret flaw in his life. The gospel writers racked their brains trying to explain Judas' action. The only reason they could come up with, the only motivation they discover in his life, was his motive of money. Judas did these things because of money. He had greed as a motivation in his life and it is really spelled out by the gospel of John. John 12:6 for instance tells a story of how Mary, the sister of Lazarus, anointed Jesus' feet with perfume, and Judas, stands up and rebukes her. Jesus tells him to quiet down and John tells why Judas objected. It says this in John 12:6: ""Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor."" (Also we find this story in Matt. 26:6-13; Mark 14:3-9 and Luke 7:37-39. ) Gregory Johnson commented on Mar 18, 2017 What a timely message for the hour.

Acts 2:42-47,"('Fellowship', 'Prayers', 'Breaking Of Bread', 'Apostles Doctrine')",Baptist," September 2, 2013 By: Tom Lowe Series: The Early Church Title: Unity Among the People Acts 2.42-47 (KJV) 42 And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. 43 And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles. 44 And all that believed were together, and had all things common; 45 And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need. 46 And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, 47 Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved. Commentary And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, ""And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine (In the things taught by the apostles.),"" which is the same as the doctrine of Christ, and He is the author, teacher, and subject of His doctrine; the essential themes of which is peace with God, pardon of sins, righteousness, and salvation by faith in Him: this is system of belief the apostles received from Christ, and constantly taught in their ministry; for that reason, it is called ""the apostles' doctrine."" The word ""doctrine"" now has a technical connotation, and means a collection and arrangement of abstract views supposed to be contained in the Bible. In the Scriptures the word means simply ""teaching""; and the expression here denotes that they continued to be present when the apostles gave instructions. One evidence of conversion is a desire to be instructed in the doctrines and duties of the Christian religion, and a willingness to attend the preaching of the gospel. These young converts had embraced this doctrine gladly, and were not only believers of it, but resolute believers; they were constantly hearing it, continually involved in the ministry of the apostles, committed to memorizing the doctrines taught by the apostles, and stood firm in the faith of the Gospel, in spite of all the rebuke cast upon them by their countrymen, and the hardships they endured for it. ""Fellowship"" does not mean the apostles' fellowship, but the ""fellowship"" of the Church (which would include the apostles)--that common life of close brotherhood in which they did everything together, and shared with the others all they possessed, so that there seemed to be one heart and one mind shared by all of them. Although fellowship in our day does not have the same depth of sharing, we still have many things in common with those first Christians, as well as having many things in common with our brothers and sisters in Christ. All Christians have the same hope of heaven; the same joys; the same hatred of sin; the same enemies to contend with. Consequently, they have the same subjects of conversation, of feeling, and of prayer; and they have spiritual union in these things. And thus the early Christians had their property in common. ""Fellowship"" here may apply to any or to all of these things: to their conversation, their prayers, their dangers, or their property; and it also means that they were united with the apostles, and participated with them in whatever happened to them. Christians feel that they are a band of brethren, and that, however much they were separated before they became Christians, now they have many important interests in common; they are united in feelings, in interests, in dangers, in conflicts, in opinions, and in the hopes of a blessed immortality. These first Christians became known for their constant contributions towards the support of the apostles and of the poor members of the church."
Psalms 95:1-7,"('Community', 'Worship', ""God's Love"")",Baptist," Tradition! Psalm 95 March 5, 2017 Have you ever noticed that sometimes we do things for a reason, but many times we really don't know the reason? Sometimes we don't recognize how our decisions are predicated on past events which we're totally clueless about. For example, and I'll tell you upfront there is disagreement about these facts, but as I did some research, I think there is some validity. So here you go - - - When you consider the United States space program, especially the space shuttle program, each lift off needed rocket boosters to carry the space shuttle into space. The boosters deliver enormous power - - - -they weigh more than 2 million pounds at takeoff, they produce 6.6 million pounds of thrust. That's the equivalent of 32 - - - 747's all applying their take-off thrust at the same time! In only two minutes, they carry the astronauts 28 miles away from the earth, spending all of their fuel in the process. (Source: Jim Banke's article on www.space.com, ""Interactive Space Shuttle: The Boosters."" www.space.com/news/spaceshuttles/interactive_sts_boosters.html But remember, this story is about decisions we make today, based on the past, not knowing the reasons. The boosters are manufactured and refurbished by a company in Utah, which then ships the boosters to Florida for the space launches via train. So, the boosters must be able to fit on a rail car that travels along railroad tracks. And those tracks are exactly 4 feet, 8.5 inches wide. So, the space shuttle, like those boosters, if you're going to get that part from Utah to Florida, you've got to know that the measurement of 4 feet, 8.5 inches wide is a critically important measurement. But why would our railroad tracks measure such an odd width? Historians disagree on this one, but part of the story for some of why our railroad tracks are this measurement is because the English made their tracks exactly that wide. Early on in the railroad industry, we relied on the English about the railroad. Why did the English make their tracks 4 feet, 8.5 inches wide? Because the English engineers of the 19th century used the standard wagon width that had been used in Europe since the Romans built their roadways, which were 4 feet, 8.5 inches wide. And why that width? Because, historians say, Roman trial and error found that an official chariot or wagon would work best while being powered by two horses, and those two horses, measured from the back end of the horses - - - - was ideally 4 feet, 8.5 inches. Are you getting this? Bottom line is this - - - The most impressive travel in all of human history, blasting off from Cape Canaveral, this incredible feat of space travel, is, in effect, affected by the tape measure draped over the rear end of a pair of Roman horses. You see, our railroad system is based on this, and actually it's one of the reasons it's believed the South lost the Civil War. They had 3 different measurements for their railroads. My point in all of this - - - - the decisions we make today, are often the result of the past. And the decisions we make tomorrow will have a longer lasting impact than we ever could have imagined."
Revelation 1:9-20,"('Revelation', 'Tribulation', 'Lights For Christ', 'Lamps')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Revelation 1:9-20 Jesus, His People, the Local Church 3/5/17 D. Marion Clark Introduction Who are you? How you answer that question guides how you live your life. In our text this morning, John lays before us the identities of three parties: that of fellow Christians, of Jesus, and of the local church. Text The People of Jesus I, John, your brother and partner in the tribulation and the kingdom and the patient endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. 10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet 11 saying, ""Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea."" John, in identifying himself, identifies the Christians to whom he writes. Together they are partners in ""the tribulation, the kingdom, and the patient endurance that are in Jesus."" Out of three identifying contextual marks, two have to do with suffering: tribulation and patiently enduring the tribulation. The first, they have no control over. Tribulation is forced upon them. It has become a way of life for them as members of a minority religion that is held in suspect by some, in disdain by others, and even as dangerous by legal authorities. No, they do not have control over the tribulation forced upon them, but they do have control over their response to its hardships. They can face it through patient endurance. And this is the reason why John is writing his letter - to encourage his fellow followers of Christ to patiently endure the afflictions that they face for their faith. Between ""tribulation"" and ""patient endurance"" is another identifying context that explains the reason for the tribulation and that gives the motive for the patient endurance. John and his readers are partners in the ""kingdom."" It is the kingdom that is ""in Jesus,"" that belongs to Jesus. John's readers are suffering in tribulation because they belong to this kingdom. They might on earth be counted as citizens of the kingdom of Rome and of whatever local land where they live, but their ultimate and true citizenship is in and of the kingdom of their Lord Jesus Christ. That makes them suspect to the world. Why? Because the values of the kingdom of Jesus Christ are opposed to the values of this world which belongs to the kingdom of ""the prince of the power of the air"" (Eph. 2:2). Two remarks by the apostle Paul illustrates this conflict. In his first letter to Timothy, he instructs Christians to pray for government leaders, ""that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way"" (1 Tim. 2:2). In his second letter to Timothy he observes from his own experience that ""all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted"" (2 Tim. 3:12). It goes with the territory - with a Christ-kingdom citizen living in an earthbound kingdom. But with such territory also comes the power to live in such a predicament - for we live under and in the power of Jesus Christ. We face tribulation for and in Jesus; we patiently endure by and in Jesus; we live under the rule and in Jesus, that is, by his power given to us through the Holy Spirit. Indeed, we do not merely survive but we conquer, as Jesus will speak of and commend to each of the seven churches."
Philippians 4:1-9,"('Coping', 'Disappointment', 'Surviving', 'Enduring')",Independent/Bible," The Power of Distraction (Philippians 4:1-9) 1. The psychology professor was giving an oral test. She asked, ""How would you diagnose a patient who screaming at the top of his lungs one minute, then sits in a chair weeping uncontrollably the next?"" A sports-minded young man answered, ""He's probably a basketball coach?"" [funnp.com] 2. We have our high and low times in life. For example, one blogger wrote, ""Today, my girlfriend broke up with me, saying, ""I'm not ready for a serious relationship."" We're supposed to get married in a month."" 3. This is a low time for this fellow, a hard experience to get through. 4. Life can hold other, longer-term heartbreaks, issues, burdens. Disappointments, conditions or situations that drag on for years or decades. Main Idea: When we have to cope for the long term, we need to implement God's template for doing so. Distraction is a key element in this process, but needs to be viewed as part of the whole process. God gives us a strategy to help us cope with life. We need to take it out of mothballs and put it to work. I. Advice for Coping That Sometimes Gets the PUBLICITY in the Pulpit A. PARTICIPATING in church life, the good and the bad (1-3) The Philippian church suffered from conflict. Some Christians take off at the slightest conflict. You work things out when you sense you have to. Like marriage, if you leave yourself the option of escaping, you won't address... B. REJOICING in the Lord (4) C. Maturing in the Lord demonstrated by SENSIBILITY (5a) Biblical wisdom Self-restraint Patience and humility Information not enough; must have sense D. Consoling ourselves with the HOPE of Jesus' return (5b) E. Facing that we are ANXIOUS, disappointed, depressed (6a) 1. The same word is used for being concerned about others... 2. Worry or anxiety is not evil, in moderation; caution, for example is good 3. When we feel distraught or debilitated by worry, that's another level. 2 Corinthians 4:8-9, ""We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed;"" F. POURING out our concerns to God in prayer with thanksgiving (6b-7) 1. Relief, not cure 2. Result: a sense of God's peace II. Crucial Advice that Is NEGLECTED or Misunderstood (8-9) Last year, we memorized Philippians 4:8-9, some key verses in These additions fortify the above for the long term. A. We need to DISTRACT ourselves with good things (8) 1. The NEED for distractions a) Interests do a lot for us: they relax us, make us more interesting to other people, expand our minds/skills, help us unwind, balance, refresh us. b) God gives us good things to distract us to help us cope with life. c) If you have a long-term issues -- an disappointing marriage, a physical limitation, financial pressures, a nasty boss, wayward children...you have to cope for a long time. You need a long-term coping strategy, and finding wholesome distractions is a crucial part of it."
Matthew 12:22-32,"('Decision', 'Unpardonable Sin')",Baptist," Of all people admired in the world today, Jesus of Nazareth ranks at the top of the list. Even many who aren't believers regard Him as one of the wisest teachers and most loving leaders the world has known. So why did His contemporaries kill him? What was it about what He said or did that was so provoking and upsetting that religious and secular leaders alike wanted him dead? What was it that could make crowds that once followed Him turn on Him? If Jesus was simply the gentle genius some portray him to be, how could this have happened? There's only one explanation: Jesus was much more than meek and mild. He was more than a poetic philosopher. Jesus was the Light of Heaven hitting a darkened earth like a meteor blast. He made claims and demands that left people undone. He named realities that others sought to bury. He broke barriers no one else had the nerve to assault. He called for the utter dismantling of the way things were and the new creation of something much better. Jesus wasn't politically correct. He wasn't religiously pious. He wasn't socially tame. He was a dangerous man because he was, and is, the God who is dangerously good. In our passage for today we see the conflict between Jesus and the religious leaders of His day intensify to the point of their complete rejection of Him, and His warning to them of what that would mean. 1. A miracle and an accusation - vs. 22-24 A. The miracle - vs. 22-23 Jesus healed a man who was blind and mute because of a demon. The people who saw this were amazed, wondering if this could be the ""Son of David."" They saw the deliverance and healing of this man as proof that Jesus was the Messiah. The indication is that some there believed on Jesus and acknowledged Him as the Messiah as a result. B. The accusation - v. 24 In contrast with those who believed on Christ, the Pharisees rejected Him, saying that He cast out demons by the power of Beelzebub, which means ""lord of the flies,"" and is a reference to Satan. They were trying to turn the people against Jesus by claiming His miracles were empowered by Satan. 2. An answer and a declaration - vs. 25-29 A. The answer - vs. 25-27 Jesus gave a common sense answer. Any kingdom, city, or household divided against itself will fall. This would be true of Satan's kingdom: for the prince of demons to cast out his own demons didn't make sense. So, if Jesus cast out demons, He could not be working for Satan. Jesus further insisted that if His work was empowered by Satan, then Satan must also be empowering their efforts to deliver the demon possessed. B. The declaration - vs. 26-27 Jesus said the work He did was by the Holy Spirit. In Luke 11:20, we are told Jesus also said He cast out demons by ""the finger of God,"" referring to Exodus 8:19. The Pharaoh's magicians could copy some of what Moses did to a point, but when God performed a miracle through Moses they couldn't, they called it ""the finger of God."" Jesus said the way He cast out demons was superior to how the Pharisees did. How?"
"Ezekiel 37:1-10, Zechariah 4:6","('Holy Spirit', 'Anointing', 'Truth Of Christ', 'Holy Ghost Fire', 'Power From On High')",Pentecostal," Ezekiel 37:1-10& vs14 Zec 4:6 Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts. *Hand of the Lord upon me: This means taught, led, guided, protected, empowered, (it is a wonderful thing to know Gods hand is on your life. *Carried out in the Spirit: If we are going to see the glory of God revealed we are going to have to get out of the flesh realm over into the spirit realm. This is the reason why we don't see more glory and more power, this is the reason why we experience so little of the demonstration and the manifestation of the Power of God. It is because God does his work by the Power of the Holy Spirit and the only way to participate with him is to get into the spirit. It's not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord. The spirit is not just the feeling of God touching you, or even God moving inside of you, by the HolyGhost: the spirit is speaking of the realm, and of the dimension and of the environment of God. John said: I was in the Spirit on the Lords day: (When John got in the Spirit (In the God dimension, that's when he began to see the glory of God, he saw the Lord with feet like brass as though they had been burned in a furnace, he saw his eyes as though they burned with fire. He saw the throne, he saw and heard the angels, he saw the four and twenty elders, he saw the altar of God. To see what John saw: We have to be where he was when he saw it, (In The Spirit). Ezekial was in the Spirit: This was not the first time Ezekial was in the Spirit. Ezek 1: 3 and the hand of the LORD was there upon him. This is when Ezekiel saw the great whirlwind of fire, and the living creatures, and he saw the throne of God, and he saw the appearance of a man who was on fire, from his loins upward, and from his loins downward as the appearance of brightness as the color of amber. I know this is going to sound a little crazy, but that's where we belong, that's our environment, (I'm not talking about dying and going to heaven) I'm talking about living in the realms of the glory of God. Ga 5:16 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. Ga 5:25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. Don't misunderstand me: I'm not insinuating that we should all walk around seeing angels everywhere, and hearing voices and trumpets and things like that, and that if you're not experiencing that then you're not spiritual. (No I'm not saying that at all) What I'm saying is that to experience the operation of the Spirit, we must be full of the Spirit and walking in the Spirit. In other words: The realm of the glory of Gods presence must become more important to us than this flesh realm. Healing, deliverance, Miracles, signs and wonders all emanate from the glory realm, or I could simplify it by saying (The Kingdom realm). All supernatural activity of the Spirit of God belongs to the Kingdom of God. Jesus revealed to us that Power of the devil, or power to destroy the works of the devil, or power to cast out devils was the direct result of the Kingdom of God being present."
"2 Corinthians 1:3-4, Matthew 5:4","('Death', 'Grief', 'Bereavement', 'Mourning')",Christian/Church Of Christ," HoHum: Here's a story from a telemarketer: ""The other day I called a house and a real nice lady answered the phone, she was really helpful and friendly, she was the type of lady that helps a telemarketer get through a long day. After some pleasantries I asked if Mr. Smith was in, ""I'm sorry"", she answered ""I'm afraid he doesn't live here anymore."" Now that was a real disappointment being that she was a nice lady and all, but I took it all in a stride, ""I'm sorry to hear that ma'am. Do you happen to have his new number."" ""Sure thing!"" The woman cheerfully replied, listing off his new number. I hung up the phone and quickly called the new number and was surprised to hear a recording. ""Thank you for calling Green Acres Cemetery..."" Gathered from: http://www.f150forum.com/f15/got-joke-post-221708/index45/ WBTU: When I was preaching, an older couple came to the church. I visited with this delightful couple. They were from Cincinnati. They had moved out to a farm near the church and had animals all over. Norman told me that his wife Joan had Alzheimer's. They wanted to continue to attend their church in Cincinnati but Norman knew that as things got more difficult for his wife, they would be attending our church more and more. They did come to the church about once a month and then not much at all. From time to time I would call them on the telephone to see how they were doing. On several occasions, Joan would answer the phone and then after a few minutes of conversation, would go into the bedroom and wake up Norman. I would ask Norman how he was, he would say tired, and then give the phone back to Joan. Turns out that Norman was staying up at all hours with Joan. Norman would take care of the animals, take care of Joan and everything else. On more than one occasion, I told Norman that it would be good to have some people from the church to sit with Joan while Norman got some sleep or got out to do something else. Oh, no, Norman could take care of it all. One time, several months went by and I did not see them. I called them on the telephone. Joan answered the phone and said something dreadful had happened. Norman had died. I asked Joan if there was anyone else at the house and Joan gave the phone to her son. Yes, he confirmed that Norman had died. A few weeks after this Joan came to the church with her daughter in law. After the service, Joan came up to me in tears and said that the farm with all of her beloved animals was to be sold and she would have to go into a nursing home. She loved her animals and she loved her farm but all of it would have to be sold. Oh, Norman, it may not have changed anything, but I can't help but think that if he would have accepted more help, how things might have ended differently! Much of the same advice and help that caregivers need in caregiving, is the same advice and help that caregivers need when their loved one dies. When the loved one dies, there is a sense of relief, but grief comes and consumes a caregiver. As a griever, we need to appreciate the fact that grief is work. It requires both physical and emotional energy. It is no less strenuous a task that was the caregiving. The term ""grief work"" was coined by psychiatrist Erich Lindemann in 1944 to describe the tasks and processes that we go through in grief. The term shows that grief is something we must work at actively if we are to deal with grief in a healthy fashion. It demands much more than merely passively experiencing our reactions to loss: we must actively do things and undertake specific courses of thought and action to help us in our grief."
John 8:1-11,"('Grace', 'Grace And Truth', 'Woman Caught In Adultry', 'Love With Grace And Truth')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Title: Grace + Truth = Love Text: John 8:1-11? Bottom Line: Most of us lean towards grace OR truth. Jesus was full of grace AND truth. Intro Good Morning Real Life! Last week we kicked off a series called Tension. If you missed last week I would encourage you to hop online or go grab the podcast and listen to last weeks message. I'm really excited for this series because I think this Tension between grace and truth is a really important reminder for us all. Because this isn't something we naturally drift towards. We've got to be intentional about setting the course to get to the right tension. I don't know about you, but I find it difficult to live in this tension. There's no place in my life that I lack this tension more then when I am driving in my car. The second I get in my car grace goes right out the window, my wife can attest to that... Anyone relate? I know the rules and the customs of the road and if you aren't following them I got NO grace for you. I lack that tension in the car. But every now and then I will make a mistake while driving, rare, but it happens. I'll cut someone off, pull out in front of a car I didn't see, or not pay attention to my speed. I make a mistake and someone honks at me and flips me off. And then a strange thing happens. For the rest of my drive when I see someone do something wrong I don't get mad. I don't honk. I don't get up on their bumper. I let it go. It's in those moments I realize the importance of living in that tension of Grace and Truth because I see how out of whack I am. In John 1:14 it says Jesus came full of grace and truth. But problem is in our lives most of us lean towards grace OR truth. (Show Rubber Band) Here's the reality, we need this tension. Because truth without grace breeds self-righteousness and legalism. Grace without truth breeds deception and moral compromise. The best expression of love is found in the tension between grace and truth. And that's why we are doing this series... Because we want to know how to live in the tension between grace and truth. The truth is we are really bad at this tension. We aren't very good at living in this tension. Sometimes we don't offer grace to people in our lives that need it. And sometimes we don't tell people the truth of their actions. But we aren't alone, we aren't the first ones to struggle with this tension. Tension Throughout the Bible people have struggled with this tension. Maybe the one we can relate to most is the first century Church of Corinth. They struggled with this tension as we do. And if you were to read 1st and 2nd Corinthians it would probably look a whole lot like a mirror. They struggled with very similar issues that we are facing today. Questions about church leadership, sexual immorality, and how to live in a culture but not be influenced by the culture were just some of the issues they were facing. They leaned towards grace and but often ignored the truth. They just kept playing the Jesus card. Jesus loves me, I'm saved by grace... Which is true... But then they go on to say, therefore I can do anything I want. Does that sound familiar?"
Matthew 9:9-13,"('Forgiveness', 'Discipleship', 'Follow')",Christian/Church Of Christ," Title: Follow-Jesus Says Place: BLCC Date: 3/12/17 Text: Matthew 9.9-13 CT: We are to follow Jesus into a relationship to know God. [Screen 1] FAS: The following prayer has been attributed to a Muslim convert to Christ: ""O God, I am Mustafah the tailor, and I work at the shop of Muhammad. The whole day long I sit and pull the needle and the thread through the cloth. O God, you are the needle and I am the thread. I am attached to you and I follow you. When the thread tries to slip away from the needle, it becomes tangled and must be cut so it can be put back in the right place. O God, help me to follow you wherever you lead me. For I am really only Mustafah the tailor, and I work in the shop of Muhammad on the great square."" Pamela Joy Anderson, You Are the Needle and I Am the Thread, (WestBow Press, 2014), page xi [Screen 2] LS: How do we that claim to follow Jesus...regard following? Do we see Jesus as our leader? Do we follow or do we worry more about just being sure we do the right things to be right with God? To just do enough to get to heaven? To be good enough? Remember the game Simon Says when you were younger. You had to do something if Simon says but not if Simon didn't say to. That is probably how a lot of us looked at Christianity if we are honest. A lot us saw Christianity as a religious game of Jesus Says. [Screen 3] Jesus says jump. We jump. Jesus says go to church. We go. Jesus says pray. We pray. Jesus says don't look over there. ....But it looks so good. ""Jesus says"" gets to where it just isn't any fun. And before you know it you start to want to do the things Jesus says not to. The game becomes a drag because you don't get to do what you want. It looks like a whole lot more fun being out of the game. Especially when you look at others not playing and they are laughing and having fun. As for me I started to like being out of the game. But then my preacher or my mama would talk about what God wanted and what I was doing was not so good. My conscious got after me. I would start playing again. I would read my Bible. Go to Church. Do the bounce. Don't look over there. But I would look at the ones not playing and start being judgmental and think it wasn't fair they didn't have to play the game like me. They were doing what they wanted when they wanted with whom they wanted. All I got to do was Do Do Do--Don't Don't Don't do this or that. I finally just wanted out. At least I would have some friends. Most of my friends did not like the Jesus Says game. No one could be that good. How could anyone win? Maybe that is how Christianity looks for you and maybe you are trying to come back or look at it again or for the first time and you feel like playing ""Jesus Says"" just sounds too hard to do. Definitely not much fun. Well if you are I have something to share. Following Jesus, which I highly recommend, is not about playing ""Jesus Says"". If I could get you to just read the gospels. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John you would discover it is not about playing Jesus Says. It is all about a relationship."
"Matthew 1:2-6, Isaiah 11:1","('Genealogy', 'Family Of God', 'Family Tree', 'Grace And Truth', 'Loved Sinners')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Title: Family Tree Text: Matthew 1 Bottom Line: God takes us in our brokenness to show the world how good and powerful He really is. Intro Good morning Real Life, Not sure about you but I'm ready for Spring! I walked out the door this morning and was greeted by some brisk air and I thought just a few more weeks! But regardless it's great to be here with you this morning... We've been in this series called Tension... looking at what it means to be full of grace and truth. How we can live in the tension between. If you missed one of the past 2 weeks, or both, I would encourage you to go download our podcast or check out our website. This series is a great reminder for us because we aren't naturally build to live full of Grace and Truth. We lean one way or the other. And this series is a good reminder and challenge for us to be full of both. We've been using this RUBBER BAND We've been looking at our actions towards others and evaluating are we full of grace and truth? Throughout this series we've been looking at this idea that The best expression of love is found in the tension between grace and truth. So far most of what we have looked at has been our interactions with others and our interaction with God. And how we need to approach those relationships with Grace and Truth. And today we are going to look at what it means that God is full of Grace and Truth and how that impacts us today. Now to get there we are going to have to do some set up work. So it might seem like we aren't talking about tension. But bare with me and it will all tie together. How many of you have looked up your genealogy? We are all interested finding that one famous, powerful, or rich person we are related too. But I think there's a little apprehension too. Because what if we found out we are related to a terrible person. What if there's a murder or dictator in our linage? What if we came from bad stock. I've tried looking into my genealogy a few times. But it's not as easy as you'd think. I know my family tree a couple generations back. I have a few native Americans genes and mostly European genes. And no famous people or really bad people in my family tree. All in all, a pretty normal looking family. Which I guess is not a bad thing... But we all want to come from good stock. We all want that famous person in our lineage. And when talking about our genealogies we are going to highlight those people. This isn't new to our culture today. In Ancient times they place a huge value on where you came from. Genealogies were a big deal. They were seen almost as your resume. Where you came from and the potential you had. You could leverage your families genealogy to gain credibility. Look at where I came from, check out my stock. And you wanted strong, powerful, rich, and famous people in your genealogy. And in ancient times to ensure you had a good genealogy they would often follow these two practices. First they would hide the bad people in your family tree. They would just leave them out. That strange uncle. Gone. That great granddad that did horrible things. Don't bring him up. They would just prefer no one knew about them. And the second thing they did was they would never record a women. This was a very patriarchal culture and women were not held in the same value as men, so they didn't make into many genealogies."
Isaiah 40:25-31,"('Creator', 'Creator God', 'Unequaled God', 'Superiority Of God')",Christian/Church Of Christ," GOD IS UNEQUALED INTRODUCTION: 'Un' is a prefix meaning ""not,"" freely used as an English formative, giving negative or opposite force in adjectives and their derivative adverbs and nouns (unfair; unfelt; unseen; unrest; unemployment). Last week my sermon was about our unchanging God. During the week I watched a little clip highlighting other 'un's that pertained to our God and I thought it would be good to expound on some of those. This week we'll look at how God is unequaled. Isa 40:25, ""To whom will you compare me? Or who is my equal?"" says the Holy One."" The first chapter of Isaiah starts out with a declaration of the people's rebellion against God, consequences for such, a call to repentance, finishing with prophetic statements of restoration. Chapter 39 ends with Isaiah revealing to King Hezekiah that the nation would be taken captive by the Babylonians. But chapter forty begins with God commissioning Isaiah to proclaim that when the consequences for their rebellion is over there will be comfort for the people. Within this chapter we will see the ways in which God communicates his preeminence to his people. Unequaled in dominance. Isa. 40:6-8, ""A voice says, ""Cry out."" And I said, ""What shall I cry?"" ""All men are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field. The grass withers and the flowers fall, because the breath of the LORD blows on them. Surely the people are grass. The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God stands forever."" God wanted his people to know that no matter how powerful some people are, no matter how long they stay in power, they are like withering grass. No matter how rich someone is, no matter how glorious they seem, that too, will come to an end like a flower of the field. Why? Because it's the Lord who determines when their end will come. No amount of power, no amount of money, no amount of prestige is able to overcome the power and glory of the Lord. The Jewish nation would be taken over by the Babylonians. King Nebuchadnezzar was a powerful man who gained control over a vast region for many years. During their long captivity I can see the Jews wondering if anything could stop this Babylonian king. But they were shown God's dominance in two ways: first, when Nebuchadnezzar became proud, declaring how great he thought he was, God removed him from his throne; showing this king who was really the King! And then God fulfilled his promise to his people by delivering them and reestablishing them as a nation. This is important for us to understand because when the powers that be-whether it's the government or our boss or a bully-seem unstoppable they are not. The only thing that is unstoppable is God. The only thing that is unceasing is God. Kingdoms crumble and empires erode but the reign of God never ends. That's important for us to understand because no matter what happens in our world, no matter what decisions are made, no matter what laws get put in place, nothing is completely set in stone; God is the one who has the final say."
2 Peter 2:1,"('Heresy', 'Blasphemy', 'Book', 'Shack')",Baptist," ""The Shack"" Sermon Manuscript by Rev. Leslie Puryear Bethany Baptist Church, Gulf, NC March 5, 2017 2 Peter 2:1 - ""But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction. And many will follow their destructive ways, because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed."" This verse refers to two things that are used by false prophets and teachers in an attempt to destroy the church by promoting false beliefs. Those two things are ""heresies"" and blaspheme."" As used in this verse, what is a 'heresy""? Well, a ""heresy"" is defined in the Greek as ""self chosen beliefs not coming from God."" What about ""blaspheme."" What does it mean to ""blaspheme""? To ""blaspheme"" is defined the Greek as ""anything spoken or written that insults God or Christ."" Today, I sense the need to examine a book, which is, according to these definitions, both heretical and blasphemous. The book is entitled, ""The Shack, which was written by W. P. Young, a man who grew up as a son of missionaries. This book was published in 2007, and to date, has sold more than 20 million copies and was on the New York Times best-seller list for 49 weeks. And this past Friday, a movie was released based on the book. This book has been highly controversial. Many readers have embraced it and many have demonized it. What's all the fuss about this book and movie called ""The Shack""? That's what I want to talk about this morning. The theme of this book is, ""Where is God in a world full of pain and hurt?"" The Shack revolves around a man named Mack. Four years before this story begins, Mack's young daughter, Missy, was abducted during a family vacation. Mack, who has been living in the shadow of what he calls his ""Great Sadness,"" receives a strange note that is apparently from God. God invites Mack to return to this shack for a get together. Though uncertain, Mack visits the scene of the crime and there has a weekend-long encounter with God, or, more properly, with the godhead, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. When Mack arrived at the Shack, the Shack had been transformed from an old rundown place to a beautiful house with gorgeous gardens all around. Mack decided to bang loudly and see what happened, but just as he raised his fist to do so, the door flew open, and he was looking directly into the face of a large beaming African-American woman. This large African-American woman is God the Father, (or at least a version of God she chose to take on, in order to communicate with Mack, according to the book). Throughout the story she is known as ""Papa."" Near the end, because Mack requires a father figure, she turns into a pony-tailed, grey-haired man, but otherwise God is this woman. Jesus is a young to middle-aged man of Middle-Eastern (i.e. Jewish) descent with a big nose and rather plain looks while the Holy Spirit is played by Sarayu, a small, delicate woman of Asian descent."
Matthew 4:1-11,"('Temptation', 'Victory In Christ', 'Sin And Evil', 'Scripture Reading')",Anglican," The First Sunday of Lent March 5, 2017 St. Andrew's Church The Rev. M. Anthony Seel, Jr. Matthew 4:1-11 True Spiritual Power On Tuesday (2/28/17), NPR's On Point program did a segment on ""Video Games for Adults."" According to the story, ""More adult Americans are playing more video games for more hours than ever before."" New York magazine reports that 155 million Americans play video games and they point out that that's more than voted in November's presidential election. [Frank Guan, ""Why Ever Stop Playing Video Games,"" vulture.com] It's the subtitle to that article that snagged me: ""Many Americans have replaced work hours with game play - & ENDED UP HAPPIER."" Ended up happier is in all caps. I remember an arcade on Broadway in Manhattan from my growing up days. That place is long gone. There is still an arcade in Chinatown, another one on the Lower East side, and two others in Manhattan, but the arcade of the 21st century is in Brooklyn near Sunset Park. It's called Next Level, and it costs $10 just to walk in the door. Next Level's space is filled with banks of monitors wired to video game consoles. You won't find any pinball machines at Next Level. You will find Xbox 360 and Playstation consoles and hard-core video gamers. New York magazine's culture website, Vulture.com reports that ""according to a variety of recent studies, more than 40% of Americans play at least 3 hours a week, 34 million play on average 22 hours each week, and 5 million hit 40 hours, and the average young American will now spend as many hours (roughly 10,000) playing by the time he or she turns 21 as that person spent in middle and high school classrooms combined."" [ibid.] Professor Erik Hurst of the University of Chicago compared the number of hours that working class men in their 20s worked from ""the beginning of the millennium until now."" He found that working class men in their 20s now work four hours less per week and they play video games for three hours a week. They replaced four hours of work with three hours of video game play. Hurst sees ""dire long term prospects for these less-employed men."" [ibid.] Yet, the men report that they are happier. Why is that? This is the conclusion that Frank Guan, the writer of the New York magazine article draws: ""To begin with, games make sense, unlike life..."" [ibid.] Life really doesn't make sense if you don't have a world view that explains sin and evil. I was struck by a quote in the NPR story - it was a Twitter comment on the New York magazine article - ""We turn to games when real life fails us."" When reality disappoints us, is escaping into a fantasy world of gaming the best option? Or would it be better to battle the demons of reality? In our gospel lesson, Jesus goes mano a mano with the devil. He's been alone in a desert wilderness for forty days and forty nights. He fasted during those forty days and night and he was hungry. v.1 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. Like Moses, who was directed by God to ascend Mount Sinai, Jesus is led up by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness. During their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land, Israel camped in the Sinai wilderness as Moses met with God on Mount Sinai."
2 Samuel 19:1-20:26,"('Persecution', 'Trust', 'Hardship Of Life')",Independent/Bible," Reading the story of the life of David, from the beginning (1 Samuel) until now (end of 2 Samuel), is like reading a man going through a Christian boot camp. "" David went through a lot, to be where God wants him to be and do what God wants him to do. God was training His servant. "" David went through the good and the bad. If fact, it seems to be more bad than good. It does not mean life is a bed of roses because you are God's anointed. "" David learns through the hardships, the mistakes, and the pain. He was far from perfect. "" What stands out, in this long and hard journey that David had, is his unwavering trust in God. He always return to God and submit to Him. It is easy for us to look at David's life and focus only on the good parts. "" But the truth of the matter is, for a large part of his life, he was struggling... with something. The psalms reveal that. Enemies without and enemies within. "" He faced persecutions and hardships, broken relationships and broken family; he faced temptations and sinned. He was constantly fighting against the enemies. "" This is what we try to ignore. Life with God must be good and happy, prosperous and peaceful. "" Yet this is not true of David, the man anointed and chosen by God to be His servant. It is not true of the servants of God we read about in the Scriptures. Matt 16:24 Jesus said to his disciples, ""If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."" "" Can we trust God enough to accept the good and the bad, knowing that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who are called according to His purpose? (cf. 8:28) "" Can we believe that there is this ULTIMATE GOOD that God is working towards, for each one of our lives? Look at David's life. He was anointed as a boy by Prophet Samuel to be the King of Israel, but waited some 20 years before that happens. "" And when he entered the palace, he was not trusted. He was persecuted by King Saul and had to run for his life. "" God did not give him a straight path to the throne, even though that was prophesied. "" David had to fight many battles, before he became King, and even after. I won't rehash that. But just for the recent few chapters, we saw the hardships and pains that David was put through. "" David fell into temptation and sinned. He committed adultery with Bathsheba and killed her husband Uriah. "" He repented but lost his first son, as a judgment from God for giving the nations the chance to blaspheme His name. Sin has its consequences. His daughter Tamar was raped by her half-brother, Amnon. Two years later, Absalom took revenge and killed Amnon, his half-brother. "" Absalom was angry with David's lack of action and conspired successfully in forcing his dad out of the palace. "" David was betrayed by those close to him. He was ostracised by the tribes. "" Even as he fled (2 Sam 16:5) someone from Saul's clan came out to curse him and throw stones at him. Eventually, when Absalom was killed, David grieved for his son. When would you do, if your son is your enemy?"
John 14:15-21,"('Love', 'Obedience')",Pentecostal," OBEDIENCE: THE EVIDENCE OF HIS LOVE Study Text: John 14: 15 - 21 Introduction: - Jesus said, ""If you love me, you will obey what I command"". Three motives for obedience exist: We can obey because we have to; we can obey because we need to; or we can obey because we want to. - A slave obeys because he has to. An employee obeys because he needs to. But a believer obeys God's word because he wants to - for the relationship between him and God is one of love. - Obedience is a central theme throughout Scripture. From the story of creation to the end of Revelation, it's difficult to turn a page that doesn't deal - directly or indirectly - with God's call for obedience. - In our time, however, obeying God's commands often is ignored, dismissed, or glossed over. Why? Because obedience slaps us in the face. It confronts our sin. It challenges our lives. - Yet God commands us to obey, not because he is on a power trip, but rather because he wants what's best for us. God's commands are not to kill our fun, but to increase our enjoyment - God would have established Saul's kingdom forever, but because of his disobedience, it was given to another person. - Now obeying God is not like obeying anyone else. Even parents often lead their children wrongly by commanding wrong things of them. But God is perfect and all wise. - He never commands of us that which is wrong. He loves us more than any other and would never lead us where it would not be for our ultimate good. - We shall discuss the topic under three sub-headings: 1. The Subject of Obedience 2. The Strength for Obedience 3. The Stumbling blocks of Obedience 1. The Subject of Obedience 1 John 2: 1 - 6 - ""If you love me you will keep my commandments,"" says Jesus to us today (John 14:15). We could say that is a very strong statement by Jesus. Does this mean that every time we sin we do not love Jesus? - Yes. Although we love Jesus, every time we commit sin we love something or someone else more than Jesus. If we love Jesus more than anything else we will keep ourselves free from sin for Jesus. If we love Jesus we will strive to give ourselves totally to him. When we sin we are giving ourselves to something other than Jesus or to somebody other than Jesus. - And when we love Jesus with all our heart, soul, mind and strength we will not want to put anything, no matter how small, before Jesus. - Four realities for obeying his commands are revealed in these verses. i. Obedience proves our salvation (1 John 2:3) - John is not answering the question, ""How does one become a Christian?"" He is not saying that if you want to be saved or receive God's grace or know God, then you have to obey. - He is saying, ""Here's how you know that you know God: it's manifested in the way you live. It's manifested in your obedience."" In other words, we know that we know God because we keep his commandments. - John is not teaching that salvation is conditional on obedience. John is teaching that salvation is evidenced by obedience. And, in turn, that obedience contributes to our assurance of salvation. Obedience is a sign that we know God, recognizing that God expects his people to live a certain way - His way. Stevan Bell commented on Mar 25, 2017 Very, very good teaching!  Truly opened my eyes once again to the awareness and importance of our obedience to Christ.  Thank you, brother for sharing this sermon.  Loved it!

"Ephesians 3:1-10, John 10:10","('Fellowship', 'Hope', 'Adoption', ""Jesus' Brother"", 'Father God', 'Relationship', 'Loved By God')",Salvation Army," Being God's Adopted Children Morning my name is Andrew. You may have seen me around here looking at work that has been done when the men have been in painting or fixing the bathrooms. I became a Christian when I was the same age as some of you sixteen I am now 53 years old, still a young man. I understand today is family Sunday. Families can be strange things, mine has been pretty dysfunctional and messy at times. But the Bible tells me about how God has done a wonderful thing for all of us because of his son Jesus. It says this! ""Long, long ago he decided to adopt us into his family through Jesus Christ. (What pleasure he took in planning this!) He wanted us to enter into the celebration of his lavish gift-giving by the hand of his beloved Son."" ( From around Ephesians 1:3-10 Message). This is an interesting thing that passage says is that we all would be in the thoughts of God. Sometimes I have wondered if anyone was thinking of me, God's word tells me that long, long ago that he decided to adopt me into his family through Jesus. He planned this for all of us. Jesus tells us that he came so that we could have life in all its fullness. (John 10:10) The thing I have discovered since I became a Christian is that I have life in all it's fullness. I don't have all the material things I want, but I have all the things I need. I have this huge extended family of people that I know love me because Jesus loved them also. God in his goodness planned this, because he loved us, he made it possible through Jesus life and death and resurrection. What I also know is that God's Holy Spirit is my comforter, guide, helper and friend and that because of this I am never alone as I respond to his leading. So I have been adopted into this family, and as such I have all these family members who also have Jesus as their brother, with our Heavenly Father as their Father, some people here are my sisters by adoption, they may not have realised it, Mrs, DeSilva, Major Vajira, even my Father and Mother in law are my brother and sister in Christ, funny that. Because of Jesus even old enemies become brothers. I have read stories about men who have been at war with one another who in finding Jesus as their saviour have become close friends, as sons of the living God. It is my hope for you also that you will find yourselves to be family with one another as you accept your adoption into God's family. In Christ we are new creations, children of God not because of something that human hands have done but because God the Father wants us to be his children, so that he can love us and prove his love for us. You are loved and cared for by God the creator, you can be his children."
Acts 3:1-11,"('Peter And John', 'Lame Man', 'Gate Of The Temple', 'Hour Of Prayer')",Baptist," Peter and John and a man born lame By: Tom Lowe Series: The Early Church Lesson II.C.1: A Sign to Israel: A Lame Man Healed (3.1-11) Acts 3.1-3.11 (KJV) 1 Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour. 2 And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple; 3 Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms. 4 And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us. 5 And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them. 6 Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. 7 And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. 8 And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God. 9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God: 10 And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him. 11 And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering. Introduction to Verses 1-11 The apostles and the first believers attended the temple worship at the hours of prayer. Peter and John seem to have been led by the Holy Spirit, to perform a miracle on a man who was over forty years old and had been a cripple from his birth. Peter, in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, told him to rise up and walk. Accordingly, if we would attempt the healing of men's souls, we must go forth in the name and power of Jesus Christ, calling on helpless sinners to arise and walk in the way of holiness, by faith in Him. How precious is the thought to our souls that regardless of all the crippled faculties of our fallen nature, the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth can make us whole! With what holy joy and rapture shall we walk the holy courts, when God the Spirit causes us to enter there by his strength! Commentary Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, Peter and John must have had a close friendship, which probably began when they worked side-by-side in the fishing-boats while they pursued their trade as fishermen on the Sea of Galilee. Luke tells us that the sons of Zebedee were ""partners with Simon,"" and helped him to land the miraculous draught of fishes. The account of this miracle is found in Luke 5--""Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net. And when they had this done, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake. And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink. When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken: And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men"" (Luke 5:4-10). We find the two sons of Zebedee associated with Peter in the inner circle of the Lord's apostles, at the Transfiguration, at the raising of Jairus' daughter, and at the agony in the Garden of Gethsemane--""And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately"" (Mark 13:3). But the still closer friendship of Peter and John appears first when they go together to the palace of Caiaphas on the night of the Lord's betrayal--""And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple (John): that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest."" (John 18:15), and then in the memorable visit to the holy sepulcher on the morning of the Resurrection--""Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved (John), and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him. Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulcher. So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulcher"" (John 20:2-4). (Also see John 21:7, 20, and 21.). It would seem natural then, in the early chapters of the Acts, that we find Peter and John constantly acting together at the very forefront of the Christian army (Also see Acts 3:3, 11; Acts 4:13, 19; Acts 8:14, 25)."
"2 Samuel 16:1-17:23, Psalms 27:14","('David', 'Patience', 'Waiting On God', 'Waiting On The Lord')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," Title: Waiting on God Text: 2 Samuel/Psalm 27:14 Intro I'm so excited to be here with you this morning! We are starting a new series called In the Meantime. If you need a Bible raise your hand and one of our ushers will get you one. In this series we are going to be looking at several different characters in the OT and the NT that had to wait on God. We want to know what they had to do in the meantime. We are going to look at what they did well, what they didn't do well and what we can learn. Let me start this series off with a question... How's your patience doing? Throughout this series over the next 4 weeks we are going to be looking at what it means to wait on God. The story we are going to look at today is the story of David, In Psalm 27:14 he says this about patience: Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord. Psalm 27:14 Let me ask you again, how's your patience doing? Does it line up with this passage? I suspect if we were to all answer this honestly most of us would admit we have room to improve. Nothing shows me that I have a need for more patience like when I am driving between 4:30-6:30pm... Nobody here knows how to merge or use their turning signals... But there's more serious ways that our lack of patience shows up. How about with your kids are you patient? Are you always patient with your spouse? How about with your boss? How about with that neighbor that won't cut his grass? Eventually if we keep going down the list we will find something we all struggle to be patient with. While those situations can all test our patience throughout this series we are going to look at what it means to wait on God. The stories in the Bible that we will look at throughout this series show people waiting on God. We will see what it means to wait on got for healing, deliverance, and God's timing. We will see people waiting on God for what he has promised them. We will see people get frustrated having to wait on God. We are going to see real people, in real situations, that have to have real patience. And what we what to do is look at them and see what we can learn. We want to know what we are supposed to do in the mean time... Tension Let's set the stage before we look at how David waited on God... Saul is King of Israel. And he's not a good one. In fact God rejects him. God decides to choose a new king to lead so he sends Samuel, a prophet, to anoint a new king. God tells Samuel to go find Jesse. One of Jesse's son's will be the next king of Israel. When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, ""Surely the Lord's anointed stands here before the Lord."" But the Lord said to Samuel, ""Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart."" Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass in front of Samuel. But Samuel said, ""The Lord has not chosen this one either."" Jesse then had Shammah pass by, but Samuel said, ""Nor has the Lord chosen this one."" Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to him, ""The Lord has not chosen these."" So he asked Jesse, ""Are these all the sons you have?"" ""There is still the youngest,"" Jesse answered. ""He is tending the sheep."" Samuel said, ""Send for him; we will not sit down until he arrives."" So he sent for him and had him brought in. He was glowing with health and had a fine appearance and handsome features. Then the Lord said, ""Rise and anoint him; this is the one."""
John 2:1-11,"('Change', 'Transformation', 'Miracle', 'Water To Wine')",Baptist," ""Transformed!"" John 2:1-11 Please open your Bibles to the gospel of John, chapter 2. Today we are beginning a new sermon series I have titled, Jesus the miracle worker. Read John 2:1-11. It's good when you start, to start at the beginning. Before Jesus made his official entrance into public ministry, Jesus performed one miracle. He would then go on to perform nearly 40. Most seem to agree on about 38 that we have record of. It is important to stop and remember what John said: ""Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written."" I'm sure there were many other signs and miracles we are simply not aware of. But this was the first and it is interesting that he chose to perform this miracle at a wedding. Less than a week has now gone by since Jesus had appeared in the desert. John had prophesied that Jesus was coming and when he arrived, John said, ""Behold the Lamb of God who has come to take away the sins of the world. ""There was a system taught in the OT for hundreds of years that on particular days man should bring a sacrifice-often a lamb. The lamb was to be without blemish. The lamb would then be sacrificed on the altar, blood would be shed and man would receive forgiveness. This completed the Scripture that says without shedding of blood there is no remission/forgiveness of sins. Now this lamb has arrived and that system from the OT is about to change completely. Then in just a few days a wedding takes place in Cana. We don't know how many guests there were but the Scripture does tell us that Jesus and his mother were there and also his disciples. The Scripture gets right to the point-there was a problem-they had run out of wine and so Mary took the need to Jesus. She made him aware. I suppose that it is difficult to know exactly why she told Jesus--after all we have no record of any previous miracle Jesus had performed and later in verse 11 we learn in fact that this was his first. But certainly by this time Mary was fully aware that her son, Jesus was the very Son of God himself. So she says, ""hey, Jesus, they don't have any wine."" His response captures our attention because it sounds so abrupt. Look at it. ""What has this concern of yours to do with me, woman?"" Things are now beginning to change. Their relationship is beginning to change. This is likely the first time Mary had asked Jesus for help in a public setting. And what Jesus has to say here in the 2nd part....when He says what does this have to do with me? Seems to be explained in the last part. My hour has not yet come. So Mary who is apparently expecting this need to be taken care of then speaks to the servants and said, ""Do whatever he tells you."" There's a principle found here that God's people have attempted to live by for 2000 years and here it is: "" Do whatever he tells you. Mary knew that Jesus could do whatever was necessary as long as the servants obeyed. And the same is true today."
"John 4:21-26, Exodus 3:14, 1 Peter 3:15, John 18:1-8","('I Am', 'The Great I Am', 'Defend The Faith', 'Witness For Christ')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Jesus the Great I Am Exodus 3:14 John 4:21-26 John 18:1-8 Philippians 2:6-11 Revelation 1:8 Today I want to show you how you can prove that Jesus claimed to be God by using His own words from the Gospel of John. Using a highlighter you can become a witness for the Lord. This is the easiest witnessing you will ever do using a Bible. In fact all you really need is the Gospel of John. In my experience people want to be shown the truth not just told the truth. So show them right from God's word. You will not need to take a course to do this or go to seminary. Just turn the pages of the Gospel of John to the statements Jesus made about Himself. Many people have claimed that Jesus never claimed to be God. Those people are dead wrong. Let's see why. Jesus actually claimed to be God and He did so repeatedly. In fact that is why the Jewish religious leaders were so angry with Jesus. He wouldn't stop making the claim. He had every right to make the claim and the Jews had a right to be angry because to claim to be God is blasphemy. A great sin against God worthy of death by Jewish law. But if it's true that's another matter. The problem for these Jewish religious leaders is that they refused to accept the evidence that Jesus provided by His words and actions. Their refusal and rejection of Jesus is the same problem many people wrestle with today. Jesus the Great I Am. Defending our faith is something we all need to be able to do in this day and age. The Bible says; always be prepared to give an answer for the hope that is in you. ""But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect,"" 1 Peter 3:15 I want to show you how you can gently and respectfully defend what you believe by pointing people to a few scriptures in the Gospel of John where Jesus Himself claims to be God. Start at John Chapter 4:25-26 where Jesus openly claims to be the Messiah. Then take a highlighter and make your way through the Gospel of John marking the use of ""I Am"" by Jesus. The key to this defense is in the divine name Jesus uses time and again to identify Himself. That name is the same name our Heavenly Father identified Himself with when Moses asked what He should call Him. God said to Moses, ""I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: 'I AM has sent me to you.'"" Exodus 3:14 NIV This where the Hebrews get YHWH or Jehovah. Did you know everytime you sing Hallelujah or Alleluia you are singing God's Holy name. The Yah of God's name can be heard. Pretty cool right? Well Jesus insistence to refer to Himself over and over again as I AM is why the Jews should have took notice and they did but not for the right reasons. Throughout John's Gospel Jesus was saying He was the ""I Am"" of Exodus. The same ""I Am"" who made Moses a deliverer was now present in the flesh to personally deliver those who would put their faith in Him as Jesus the Messiah. This discovery had been made by Bible scholars many years ago and they had identified 7 key places where Jesus had used this name ""I Am""."
Revelation 14:13,"('Death', 'Resurrection', 'Life', 'Funeral')",United Methodist," How Are the Dead Blessed? Revelation 14:13 ""And I heard a voice from heaven say: ""Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord. From now on they shall have rest from their labors, and their works shall follow them."" Today we are confronted here by the death of someone we have loved. This confrontation raises questions in us as to what life is all about and how does the reality of death affect how we see life. In seeing our loved one in the coffin, it reminds us that we too will someday be in a coffin or urn. We who came from the dust will return to the dust. Is that all? If we were to follow this train of thought, that death is the ultimate reality, what is life about anyway? One way to look at it is if we come from nothing and return to nothing, does it really matter how high we rise in this life or to what depths we plunge if in the end we all return to the same nothing? It would be hard to find much comfort in such a view. The best we can say about our loved one here who struggled with cancer is ""Thank God she is not suffering any more!"" We would read this verse this morning ""Blessed are the dead"" and stop there. What a depressing view of life that kills people while they are yet alive! It says ultimately that life does not really matter. Even those who are for all appearances practical atheists still say ""Thank God, she is not suffering."" This view of life is unlivable when death seems to be the ultimate blessing. So to avoid the trap of nihilism, mankind tries to substitute an alternate message. There are those who say like the Grass Roots, ""Na, na, na, na, live for today, and don't worry about tomorrow."" This is called by the philosophers ""existentialism."" Basically it is an attempt to dodge the pangs of death by concentrating on making the best of life. When one is youthful and optimistic, that sounds promising. But how well does that work in the end. I see many of you who are elderly here today with aches and pains, just like I am suffering from the ravages of age. There may be some here who are suffering even in their youth, if not from physical suffering, are suffering inside. Life has been hard for you. Outside you make the best face on life, but you are all tears on the inside. And whether you like it or not, you are staring death in the face. How hard we try to put death beyond arm's length! But all the face lifts and cosmetics cannot cover the truth that it is appointed for all men to die. There is all the uproar of how youthful Christy Brinkley looks at 63, but the fact is she is still 63. I am not 63 quite yet, but I have a pretty good idea of how 63 really feels on the inside. There are alternate explanations that try to keep us from the door, some more positive than others. But time does not permit me to go into depth this afternoon. All of the alternatives die out in despair too. For a while you can deceive yourself. You can put on spiritual mascara. But you can't hide, and you cannot escape the ""chilling hand of death."" But I am not here today to fill you with despair, but with hope. The Scripture alone has the answer to death. It does not stop with ""Blessed are the dead."" Read on! It says: ""Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord."" The Scripture des not affirm that physical death is the end at all. It is rather the beginning of eternal life or the beginning of eternal death. The blessing is only pronounced on those ""who are in the Lord."" Before I go further, I need to tell you that the departed here confessed Christ as her Lord and Savior."" She believed in the Lord. So for her, the blessing is not that she died and was released from her suffering, although that is true. The truth is that she is blessed because she is with the Lord. The Scripture says: ""Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints."" How can this be unless this death is but a doorway to now life. Death itself is not precious. It was never meant to be. It came as the result of the rebellion of the entire human race in Adam and Eve. They rejected the Lord who created them from the dust of the earth and pronounced their lives to be ""very good."" This act of sin plunged the human race into darkness. We who were made living and purposeful creatures would some day be rendered back into the dust from which we came."
Romans 7:1-6,"('Law And Grace', 'Walking In Spirit')",Baptist," Earlier this week, Ryan Fregoso shared a link on Facebook to ""25 Christian Memes That Are Funny Because They're True"". So I thought I'd share a few of them with you this morning. [Show memes] This last one is particularly relevant this morning: [But officer, I'm under grace, not law] No matter how true that statement might be theologically. I'm pretty sure that one isn't going to work, especially if you get pulled over in Oro Valley, We were introduced to the idea that we're not under the law but under grace several weeks ago in Romans 6. And this morning, we're going to come back to that idea and look at it in some more detail. I think we would all agree intellectually that it is true that once we commit our lives to Jesus and trust completely in Him that we no longer live under the law, but rather under grace. But I also know how easy it is for us to misunderstand exactly what that means - and does not mean. And I've also observed over the years just how easy it is for Christians to fall right back into the trap of living under the law and not even recognize it. I've certainly done that myself. There are at least two ways we do that. One is to think of Jesus as a new ""law-giver"" and then attempt to earn His favor by following the ""new list"" of laws that He gives. The other, more common way, is to view Jesus as the means to finally be able to obey the ""old list"". Often those approaches are voiced something like this: ""It's just not possible to [fill in the blank] and still be a good Christian, or its counterpart ""If you want to be a good Christian you must [fill in the blank]. That mindset seem to be particularly prevalent when it comes to things that we're really passionate about - whether that be a preferred worship style, a particular ministry that we're involved in, personal convictions that we've developed or even our political preferences. But apparently that is not anything new, since Paul had to address this very same issue in the early church nearly 2,000 years ago. So let's see if we can't let Paul teach us what it means to live under grace and not under the law and see if we can't develop some practical ways to make sure we do that in our lives. As we've found consistently in our study of Romans, it's always critical to make sure we consider each passage in its proper context. So go ahead and take out your Bibles and turn to Romans chapter 6 and I'll begin with a verse we examined several weeks ago - verse 14: For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace. (Romans 6:14 ESV) Paul then goes on to explain the first statement there - For sin will have no dominion over you... - in verses 15-23 of chapter 6. In those verses, Paul uses the word ""sin"" seven times and he uses the synonyms ""impurity"" and ""lawlessness"" three more times. We spent a couple weeks on those verses, developing the idea that Jesus has freed us from slavery to sin, which never delivers what it promises, and He has made it possible for us to choose to be slaves to Jesus, who always delivers what He promises."
Romans 7:7-12,"('Sin', 'The Law')",Baptist," Last weekend our elders held a retreat where we spent some extended time evaluating everything that we do as a church for the purpose of seeing how we can do a better job of helping people enter into a relationship with Jesus, grow in their faith and then help others to do the same. As a result of that time we've decided to make some changes in what we do on Sunday mornings and I'd like to take a few minutes to share those changes with you. First of all, thanks to all of you for helping us to get our worship time off to a great start this morning by bringing your fellowship into the auditorium prior to our gathering. For those of you who weren't at our annual meeting last week, our worship gathering now begins at 9:25 with a time of greeting and fellowship here in the auditorium and then at 9:30 we will begin the more formal part of our worship. The main change that we're making on Sunday mornings is to what happens after this worship gathering during what we previously called our ""Connections"" time. The children's classes will continue to meet at 11:00 in the north classrooms and there won't be any significant changes there. But for our adults, beginning today we're going to implement what we call a ""Bible Roundtable"". We will meet in the south classroom right behind the lounge area at 11:00 and will use that time to discuss how to apply some of the things that we've learned in the message that morning. We'll have some tables set up there so feel free to bring your coffee and snacks with you. There are a couple of things that you can do to help make that time more profitable. One, is that you will notice that there is a place on your sermon outline to jot down any questions or thoughts that you might have about the message so that we can discuss them during the roundtable. You will also notice that at the end of your sermon outline there are several discussion questions that we will be talking through during the roundtable time. If you take a look at those questions, you'll see that they are not merely asking you to regurgitate information from the message, but rather think about how what we've learned in the message can be applied to everyday life. I'm excited about these changes and I want to encourage you to stay and be part of that time because all of you have something valuable to contribute. Do you have any questions? Please go ahead and open your Bibles to Romans chapter 7 so that you'll be prepared to follow along in just a moment. Like we find with most things in our lives as disciples of Jesus, balance is required. And that is certainly true when it comes to God's law. Last week we focused primarily on one extreme when it comes to the law - becoming Pharisaical Christians who live and who judge others by a set of rules rather than living in a relationship with Jesus in a way that also transforms our relationships with others. But especially here in the United States, it has become quite common to go to the other extreme where the law is just thrown out completely and the word ""sin"" is never spoken because it might be offensive to unbelievers. This seems to be especially predominant in many of the large, so-called ""megachurches"". When a prominent pastor of one of these churches was asked about using the word ""sinners"" in a television interview several years ago, he responded with these words:"
Romans 7:14-25,"('The Law', 'Indwelling Sin')",Baptist," Tommy Lasorda, the former Los Angeles Dodgers manager, once described his battle with bad habits: ""I took a pack of cigarettes from my pocket, stared at it and said, ""Who's stronger, you or me?"" The answer was me. I stopped smoking. Then I took a vodka martini and said to it, ""Who's stronger, you or me?"" Again the answer was me. I quit drinking. Then I went on a diet. I looked at a big plate of linguine with clam sauce and said, ""Who's stronger, you or me?"" And a little clam looked up at me and answered, ""I am."" I can't beat linguine. How many of you here this morning can identify with Tommy Lasorda? How many of you have done battle with some bad habit or some sin, only to find out that you couldn't beat it? And my guess is that was not just the case before you became a disciple of Jesus and that you still have those battles in your life from time to time even after putting your faith in Jesus. I say that because I don't know of one single Christian, and I'm including myself, who has experienced complete victory over sin even though, as we have seen in our study of Romans, we have been freed from the penalty and power of sin by being united with Jesus. But, as we're going to see this morning, that's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, I am confident that I'll be able to show you this morning that the fact that you have those kind of battles in your life is actually a very healthy thing and even evidence of your spiritual maturity. And even more importantly, we'll see that there is hope that we can actual prevail in those struggles. We have a lot to cover this morning, so go ahead and open your Bibles to Romans chapter 7. I was originally going to break this last section of chapter 7 into two separate sermons, but it became apparent very quickly that we need to look at this whole section as one unit. So you can follow along as I begin in verse 14 and read through the end of the chapter. For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin. For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate. Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good. So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me. For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me. So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin."
Romans 8:1-4,"('Sin', 'Condemnation')",Baptist," Let's suppose that you commit a crime that is a capital offense and you are arrested for that offense. When you go to trial, your life hangs in the balance. If you're found guilty, as you deserve to be, it means death, but if you're acquitted, it means life and freedom. And let's suppose that as the trial begins, the judge decides to treat you with leniency and he gives you two choices. One option is that, even though you are guilty, he will commute your sentence completely and permanently and release you to go and live life as a free man or woman with no strings attached with the hope that you will no longer live as a rebellious law-breaker out of gratitude for that leniency. The other option is that the judge will release you, but he will require you to wear an ankle bracelet so that your every move can be tracked and he will also assign a parole officer to monitor everything you do. And at the end of two years, the judge will determine whether or not to carry out your sentence and put you to death based on how well you have proven to the court that you have changed your life over that 2-year period. Which of those two options would you choose? I have to believe that every single one of us would choose the first option, right? Well the gospel of Jesus provides us with the ability to essentially make that same choice in the spiritual realm. Through faith in Jesus we have the ability to have our death sentence, one which we deserve, commuted permanently so that we can live freely and righteously out of gratitude for what Jesus has done on our behalf to make that possible. But unfortunately, it seems like, in spite of what Jesus has made possible, that many, even those who have placed their faith in Jesus, choose the second option - that of trying to achieve that commutation of their sentence on their own by the way that they live their lives. My guess is that all of us have done that at some point in our lives. I certainly know I have. And if you've ever attempted to live like that - even for a brief time - you know what a frustrating and unsatisfying kind of life that is. That's why all of us need to hear Paul's message to us this morning. Romans chapter 8 has often been called the greatest chapter in the Bible, and for the next two weeks, we'll get a taste of why so many have made that claim. Unfortunately, due to the constraints of the calendar and the Advent season that will begin in two weeks, we're only going to be able to just scratch the surface in this encouraging chapter today and next Sunday. But the good news is that we'll be able to come back and revisit it again next fall. So go ahead and turn in your Bibles to Romans 8. I'm only going to attempt to cover the first four verses of the chapter this morning. There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit."
Romans 8:5-11,"('Commitment To Christ', 'Walking In Spirit', 'Walk By The Spirit')",Baptist," After Mary and I got married, I had enough credits so that I could finish up my degree at the University of Arizona in just one semester - that is as long as I could complete 21 units of classwork. Since I was also working three different part-time jobs at the time, I knew that was going to be difficult so I found a couple of elective classes that I knew wouldn't require too much time and effort. One of them, a class called ""Techniques of Interview"", required only that I show up for class every time in order to get a ""C"" in the class, and that's exactly what I did, since all I needed in that class was a passing grade in order to graduate. The other one was an environmental education class, which Mary was able to take at the same time for graduate credit. That also turned out to be a good choice, because basically the students taught the class and as long as we attended every class session and made our presentation when it was our turn, we got to give ourselves our own grade. So I got an A in that class. Lest you think that my whole semester was that easy, however, I did have a number of really difficult business and accounting classes that semester that required much more of my time, effort and study. And I had to do that without the use of computers or access to the internet. Instead, we had to use these things called typewriters and actually go to the library and use the card catalogue in order to do research, The different approach that I took toward the classes that were part of my major versus that I had took my elective classes reminds me a lot of how some people view the Christian life. It is rather common to conclude that there are two different tracks for a Christian. There is the track for those who are really serious about their Christianity and they sign up for the discipleship track. These are the people who are ""all in"" for Jesus and they give up everything to follow Him. They yield control of every area of their lives to Jesus, including their finances and their schedules. They constantly look for ways to serve Jesus in the church and in the community and they share their faith with others regularly. They are even willing to suffer hardship and sacrifice if necessary. Then there is the cultural Christian track for more ""ordinary"" believers. Those who choose this track may pray a prayer and accept Jesus as their Savior just to make sure that they go to heaven, but they want to remain free to pursue their own dreams for success and personal fulfillment as long as they live here on earth. They occasionally drop something in the offering plate to ""pay their dues"" and once in a while they join a Bible study or volunteer at church when it doesn't interfere with everything else on their schedule. They aren't too serious about living a holy life, because that is, after all, for the fanatics on the discipleship track. Besides, they say, we're all human and God understands our weaknesses and He will be gracious to forgive us. So there is really no reason to be ""all in"" for Jesus. Bpmc Church commented on Mar 20, 2017 Praise the Lord for the clarity with which you explain this part of scripture! I appreciate it very much.

Hebrews 12:1-3,"('Discovery', 'Focused', 'Finishing Strong')",Nazarene," Life's Pitfalls and Discoveries Staying focused and finishing strong Hebrews 12:1-3 Introduction- We continue in the series called Life's Pitfall and Discoveries. Week one, we looked at the problem of un-forgiveness and the positive discovery of what forgiveness does in our lives. Week two at the wisdom God has for us to learn in our trials and our temptations. Trials; Trials can also be caused by other people's actions and unavoidable and God still desires for us to learn valuable lessons from them. Temptation; Temptation does not come from God. God is not tempted by evil nor does He use evil to cause us to do things that are against the principals of God. Temptations come our way from our own selfish ways, desiring things that we cannot have and also by disobedience and desiring the temptation more that we want to please God. Guardrails and bumpers are set up by God so that He can guide us and help us avoid the avoidable trials and give us strength and wisdom when we face the unavoidable trials in life. Here we go- Taking God's guidance and wisdom and staying focused and not stumbling and setting ourselves up for failure and disappointment. Sounds good but gets harder as we work it in our lives. Hebrews chapter 12:1-12:3 (v1) ""Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles."" Remember I said many times that when you see the word therefore, you must go back to the previous chapter to see what it is therefore. In this case, the writer of Hebrews is redirecting our attention to chapter 11, the faith chapter, which records people of great faith and strong witnesses. Noah Abraham Isaac Moses Even the prostitute Rehab, who protected the spies of Israel was shown mercy by God. They accomplished great things for God. They endured great pain and suffering much for their faith. They all were commended for their faith but they all died before the promises of God were finished. They were on the other side of the cross, but held on and believed God for His promises of ""being made perfect."" That is the cloud of witnesses that he is talking about and the group of people that help us in our walk with God. I am sure each one of us could think of someone that has made an impact on us to walk with Jesus. Each one of us at some point was invited to church by someone to hear the message of Christ and we responded. The Bible faithful witnesses were usually martyrs. Today we want to be witnesses as spectators and instead of being a cloud of witnesses, we become just clouds. ""Let us run the race with perseverance that has been marked out for us."" What does that mean? It means that if we are to accomplish what God intends, we will persevere, we will not only start the race, but we will finish strong, and we will take as many people with us as we can. We will surround ourselves with people of faith. We will throw off everything that hinders. We will get rid of the sin that so easily entangles us. Some scholars believe the reference is to all kinds of sin, others believe that is specific sin."
Hebrews 12:18-29,"('Prayer', 'Knowing God')",Nazarene," Life's Pitfalls and Discoveries Knowing God and Praying Hebrews chapter 12:18-12:29 Introduction- We continue to look at the series Life's Pitfalls and Discoveries; Prayerfully you have sensed that God wants to work not only in our lives but also use our lives to speak and help others on their journey with God. We have looked at the power of forgiveness, and the pitfall of not forgiving. Seen the wisdom of God that is available if we want it and the many consequences of doing things in our own strength and our limited wisdom. Last week, we talked about focusing on God, intentionally focusing on God and the pitfall of too many distractions that take us away from God. Good things and bad things can be distractions that will keep us from staying focused on God. Today looking at prayer, speaking to God and having a conversation with Him and wanting to hear back. Taking time to see who we are praying too and giving Him the honor and glory that is deserved. Making time to not forget that He is God and we are His followers and not the other way around. To set up the text, we will be in Hebrews chapter 12, and Hebrew 12 speaks of God's Holiness and the sacrifice that Jesus Christ made for each of us. These verses are a pulling together of the Old Testament God that most feel is too harsh, mean, and out of touch and the New Testament God that gave us His Son Jesus Christ to be our sacrifice and has made known that He desires a relationship with us.. Make no mistake about it, God is still a holy God and He has not changed but He made a way that unholy people can come into His presence without being destroyed. You read that portion of Scripture and two feelings immediately flood your soul. One is the awesome holiness of God and you think how could I ever come to Him. Why would a holy God want anything to do with me? The other is the joy that we would even be invited to come to Him and if we are not careful, we could easily forget His holiness and treat Him like a pal instead of God. Both are dangerous and both can affect our relationship with God. You would think this is a sermon on the holiness of God, but it is on prayer. Before you can understand the great and Holy God that has offered salvation, you have to grasp His holiness. To be this kind of holy, you have to be separate, in a class of your own, set apart. To be this kind of holy, you have to be morally pure. Not just a good person. To be this kind of holy, it is your character, your nature. You don't act holy, it is who you are. R.C. Sproul The Bible says that God is holy, holy, holy. Not that He is merely holy, or even holy, holy. He is holy, holy, holy. The Bible never says that God is love, love, love, or mercy, mercy, mercy, or wrath, wrath, wrath, or justice, justice, justice. It does say that He is holy, holy, holy, the whole earth is full of His glory. Do you understand this morning that God offers to us (good thing) to come into the presence of a God that is a consuming fire! A God that if He didn't allow us His presence that we would burn up like dirty rags."
Exodus 3:1-10,"('God', 'Moses & Burning Bush', 'Burning Bush', 'Hearing From God')",Nazarene," The Call of Moses Exodus chapter 3 Introduction This morning we come into the presence of God with the hope that He will speak to us and get personal with us in our lives. At least that is what you should be praying as we come together in His Word. Each one of us is on a journey and we are at different levels and we have had different things happen to us to get us where we are at. What you do with what has happened to you will determine your destiny. If you learn from your mistakes and you allow God excess to your life, you ask Him to be Lord of your life, it will not be easy but it will be satisfying and it will be eternally rewarding. You will have God's strength and you will have God's peace provided by a God that says for a believer He will not leave you nor forsake you. If you learn everything the hard way, if you do not give God excess to your life, you will not have peace, because true peace comes directly from God, and you will be limited to your own strength and there will be no eternal reward. By your own choice of not wanting God, He (God) will not force you to be with Him if you do not want too. By rejecting Him in this life, you reject Him for eternity. I want to look into the life of Moses for a moment. We remember that he did great things for God but we seem to forget that he was human and did a lot of bonehead things that God had to deal with him about and that he had to learn from his life's mistakes. Background Exodus 2, we are introduced to the birth of Moses, at a time where Hebrew babies were not safe, a Hebrew born boy that would have died had his mother not made a sacrifice that any mother would have dread to make. To save her sons life was to send him down a river to pharaoh in the hopes that the daughter of the king would have mercy on him and raise him as her own. It was a God thing when it happen because the birth mother was selected by the kings daughter to nurse this child and be paid for it. But at some point she let go of her son and the Egyptians now were raising Moses. Moses had grown to be a man and we hear nothing of the birth mother and see Moses defend his Hebrew blood line by killing an Egyptian that was beating a Hebrew man. He thought that no one had seen him do it... but he was wrong. Two Hebrew men get into a fight, Moses tries to break it up and finds that they saw him kill that Egyptian man and accused him of doing it. The secret Moses thought was safe was now exposed and Moses knew that he could no longer stay there. He left Pharaoh and that life and went to the place of Midian to escape his past. There he befriends a girl and her family, takes special care of their flock. He is taken back to meet the father. In the culture of the day, he is given the hand of his daughter and they begin a family, have a child and he is years later the son in law with the family business. Moses, with his wife Zipporah, their son Gershom, standing in a land that he was not born in saying... ""I have become a foreigner in a foreign land."" Exodus chapter 2:23-"
1 Corinthians 10:23-11:1,"('Christ', 'Freedom', 'Freedom In Christ')",Nazarene," Believer's freedom 1 Corinthians 10:23-11:1 Prayer- Introduction- Sermon title-Believer's freedom- that will have different meaning to different people. Galatians 5:1 It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery. John 8:36- So if the Son sets you free, you are free indeed. Galatians 5:13 You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh ; rather, serve one another humbly in love. We see from these scriptures that our freedom is in Christ. What Christ has done for us. That as believers in Christ we should not abuse our freedom to sin in the flesh. We are humbly to love one another. Amen. Thanks for coming. Today we live in a time that most people are searching to find their individual freedoms, there rights and find what they are willing to stand up for and die for. There is always a cause that needs your help and a group of people that feel slighted and are rallying an army of people to defend them and give them a voice. There are people passionate about their causes and there are people who just love to fight and cause trouble. There are doors that need to be opened and I believe some doors that need to be closed. In the midst of all this, we as Christians have to determine what battles to fight, what stands we will take, and what voice we want to have to be heard no only for ourselves but just as important our expression of faith in Jesus Christ. The sermon and the text today are not about your rights. Sometimes it is not about you. Question How do we as believers use our God given freedoms and not trip up weaker Christians. How we exercise our freedoms as God intends so that we can move the cause of Christ forward and also be an example of His love. 1 Corinthians 10:23-11:1 read At first reading, I think of this passage like Cat in the Hat- like reading about Green eggs and ham. Apostle Paul- Roman 7:15- ""I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do."" After reading, I want to say just do what you are suppose to do! If only that it would be that easy! For us all to interpret laws and rules the same, and be willing to accept the authority of who gave the rule or the law would be a stretch. To understand this passage, you have to look at the context. Apostle Paul, writing to the church at Corinth had a lot to say about believers freedom. He is talking to them about idol worship and what is to be offered on the altar to God. The sacrifices that are given to God must be pure and untainted and not something that is left over from another God or from your extra. He won't accept seconds. He demands first fruits and is a jealous God. He has disciplined them for their behavior concerning running the race of life and finishing strong for the Lord. They cannot be like boxers air fighting and not hitting anything, they are to be Purposeful, and preparing for the tasks on hand for the Lord. They are to be in the race for the long haul and to finish... not just start but finish and finish strong and accomplish all they were created to do while they are running."
John 5:11-9,"('Lord', 'Healing', 'Change', 'Honesty')",Nazarene," The pool of healing John 5:1-5:9 Prayer Scripture- John 5:1-5:9 Introduction- This morning I want you to pay close attention to the details of this passage of scripture. It is a familiar verse and as we hear it, we sometimes miss the new that the Lord wants because we think of the familiar. Details A crippled man was placed at the pool of healing alongside a lot of others in the same condition as he is. He had been there for 38 years. EVERYDAY HE WENT THERE. Someone else put him there. He himself could not get there without help. They were there because they believed that if they were the first one in the pool as the waters were stirred by an angel of God , the beggar would receive a healing from the waters. Jesus showed up, but this man did not know or recognize Jesus for who He was. Jesus went to him- no one told Jesus about him and asked him to come to the man. Jesus asked a bizarre question to the man that needed a miracle- Do you want to be well? Does that about cover it? Of course not! One important detail left out is the fact that this man was healed by Jesus and sent back into society. Happens in Jerusalem- could be Middletown Pa. Piers or porches around the water where men and women laid loved ones to receive a healing or at least gave them a good spot to beg from the passerby. Question I ask you this morning is...you begging or do you want to get well? You doing the same old thing everyday or is today going to be different because Jesus showed up? Today different because you recognize who Jesus is and what Jesus can do for you? I. Do you want to get well? That is a simple question with a complicated answer. By all appearance, you would think this man wanted to be healed. Been there 38 years trying to get into the water to receive his healing. I think he started out with good intentions- at first, I believe he went with the idea of healing, get me to the water and I will get myself in the pool of healing and I got this! I believe as time went on and he was not the first to get in the pool, he became more discourage and time got away and now 38 years later, he is going through the motion, but never really believing he will be healed. What could he do different? Put yourself in a position to receive healing from the Lord. I don't know about you, but I would have built or had someone build me a way to drop in the water at the right time. I would have watched others get in and figured out a way that I was in before them. I would have found those guys that dropped their friend through the roof. Whatever it took- I would have found a way! That is my story and I'm sticking to it! That is the way that we want ours written. But truth is, we each have something in our lives that we need to, should, or have been too scared to present to God that we need from Him. For some it might be an addiction, some it is relational, financial, some we have fought with God for obedience issues and that has not gone well. We keep thinking we can out last Him or He will change His mind. It takes determination to receive from the Lord. He gives instructions and I would have made sure I understood them and was on the cutting edge of receiving. If one got the healing a day as the water were stirred, I would make sure that I was the one to receive it."
"Galatians 6:7-10, Romans 10:14-15","('Evangelism', 'Outreach', 'Faithfulness', 'Witnessing')",Baptist," How our witness testifies to who we follow Galatians 6:7-10 Introduction - If the church is faithful to obey, souls would always be impacted for Him - Today, we will look at our role in church growth (impact of outreach) - Centering on our witness for Christ and how our lives must reflect Him - Everything we do should be a mirror image of who Christ is in our life - Read Galatians 6:7-10 - Pray - Before we can honestly serve the Lord, we must understand ... Point 1 - God cannot be mocked (we reap what we sow) - Before we can truly witness with our lives, we must understand that God is paying attention to what we do. - Our witness really must be consistent in who we are in Him - Re: God cannot be mocked; which means His ways cannot be fake - When we mock something, we are acting with a complete lack of respect - We are saying that this or that really isn't important - Example: when we say we will pray for someone, and we don't - we are mocking God's thing ... Prayer! God created prayer for us to use ... not vice versa. - Another example: When we make a commitment to do something - in the name of the Lord - to not do that thing is mocking God. - Consider for a moment a garden that you want to plant. - All year long you are thinking about that garden - all the crops you want to plant, the harvest that is going to come from it - and when it comes time to plant the garden you never lift a finger. - Result: Months later ... do you think you will have a successful garden? - The same applies to how we work for the Lord. - If we sit and consider all the things we would like to do, but never get out of the pew to do them, we won't be very successful either. - When I read verse 7 I see two things to consider. - First, I see that God commands that we work for Him in everything that we do - from our personal to our visible life - we are to be working constantly for the Lord. - Second, I see that we obviously reap what we sow. - Consider that old garden again ... if we never work in it, it will be a pile of weeds that we will never see a harvest from. - Many Christians are walking around telling people that they have these beautiful lives of worship and service to God, when in all actuality, they have nothing more than a pile of weeds. - Therefore, if we are acting like we are doing all these wonderful things - but are doing nothing - we are mocking the very principles that God established for His believers. - We must always be willing to understand the effect of reaping and sowing - If we do nothing, we get nothing. - If we work for the Lord, we see results from the Lord. - It really is that simple - we reap what we sow - No work produces no results of God in our life - But, when we do work for the Lord, there are ALWAYS godly results! Point 2 - What is the result of sowing? -Verse 8 shows us that no matter what we do, there will be results. - When we sow into our sinful nature, we get the world's results - It is what the world has producing for thousands of years ... sin - Consider this: As Christians, we allowed the removal of prayer from schools for one reason - we were too lazy to take a stand - and because of that schools have deteriorated to the point where police officers are in attendance every single day."
Matthew 6:9,"('Prayer', ""Lord's Prayer"", 'Father God', 'Needs Of Christians')",Church Of God," OUR PERFECT FATHER God Is the Answer to Your Deepest Needs - Part 1 of 7 Matthew 6:9 If somebody were to ask you ""What do you need most these days?"" I wonder what you'd say. Some of you might say, I need more money, I need more time, I need..... We're going to start a new series today called ""God's Answer to Your Deepest Needs"". I'm hoping this series is going to answer two questions: 1) What are the needs in my life that God's promised to meet? and 2) How does He do it? ""Why would God even be interested in meeting my needs?"" Obviously He doesn't need me. So why would God even be interested. Well because He is Our Father that's who He is. Jesus showed us that God is not some kind of impersonal force. God is not some kind of angry tyrant waiting to deal you a bummer in life. God is not some apathetic creator that really doesn't care about what's going on here. In fact, Jesus defined God in two words. He said, ""This is how you should pray, `Our Father...'"" In the Old Testament God is only called ""Father"" seven times. In this chapter alone, Jesus calls Him Father over ten times; furthermore Jesus called God Father and told us to call God Father over seventy times in the Gospels. God wants you to know Him like a Father. The point I want to make is simply this: God is a Person not a power. I like that because... I can relate to a person. I can get to know a person. I can have a relationship with a person. The problem is that for many people the word ""father"" brings up a negative image. It's a bad experience. It brings back childhood memories; sometimes it arouses regret, resentment, anger, fear, frustration, guilt. They don't have good memories of the term ""father"". If God is like my father."" No thanks, God! If that's the way God is, I'm not interested! So Jesus qualified the term. Notice Jesus says, ""Our Father, in heaven..."" He's not referring to a location because God is everywhere, He's talking about how Heaven is a place of perfection and God is a perfect Father in contrast to all of us who are human and very imperfect. God is a perfect Father. The Bible says that God has four characteristics in his fatherliness toward us: 1. GOD IS A CARING FATHER He wants you to know that you are loved and cared for. If you don't get anything else this morning, get this: You matter to God. God cares about you. He loves you. He's interested in you. Psalm 103:13 ""As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who honor Him..."" This is God's most outstanding characteristic. He's caring, loving, and compassionate. One time the disciples were out in a boat on the Sea of Galilee and a storm came up. They started taking on water and started to sink. They were tossed back and forth. They asked the most important question, the ultimate question: ""Lord, don't you care?"" We're drowning! Have you ever felt like that? I'm going under Lord! Don't you care? The answer is, ""Yes. Yes, I care a lot."" You have a heavenly Father who cares. 1 Peter 5:7 ""Cast all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you!"" Circle ""He cares""."
Matthew 6:9,"('Prayer', ""Lord's Prayer"", 'Father God', 'Needs Of Christians')",Church Of God," GOD CAN MEET YOUR NEEDS Part 2 of 7 God Is The Answer to Your Deepest Needs Matthew 6:9 As we look at the Lord's Prayer we will discover how God can meet the greatest needs that we have in our lives. I was thinking about the new grand baby on the way and realized that one of the first decisions any parent has to make regarding children is, ""What are we going to name them?"" That can be very frustrating because there are times when couples might disagree about names. In today's world there is often no thought given to what a name means. However in the bible names had meanings. Genesis 35:18 Rachel was giving birth to what would be Jacob's last son. Just before she died she named the baby boy Ben-oni which means ""Son Of My Sorrow"". Could you imagine going through life with that name, Son of My Sorrow. Every time someone would call his name it would be a constant reminder to him that he brought his mother sorrow and death. But Jacob said No, my son will not be known as Ben-oni, ""the son of my sorrow"". He will be know as Benjamin, The son of My right Hand. The point that I want you to get is this, Biblical names had meanings. With that thought I want you to realize is that God has revealed Himself to us through His name. In Psalm 83:18 That men may know that thou whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth. JEHOVAH means the self existent, self sufficient everlasting and eternal ONE, (GOD). The Bible says before we ask for our needs, we need to remember and reflect on God's name. Matthew 6:9 ""This is how you should pray: Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name."" When we say Our Heavenly Father, we need to stop and think about who our Heavenly Father is. Our Heavenly Father is the Self existent, self sufficient, Everlasting and Eternal, Who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above what we are able to ask or think of Him. This is Our Heavenly Father! Proverbs 18:10 The name of the Lord is a Strong Tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe. Today, many don't understand that 2000 years ago names meant something -- a name represented your heritage. God's name represents all that He is and reveals what He's really like. When you read the Bible you will find that God has revealed Himself through many names because no single name can describe all of God's attributes. No single name can describe all that God is. I have many names, depending on who you talk to. I'm called Father, Daddy, Honey, Pastor, Reverend and my favorite Paw Paw. Although God has many more names I've chosen four -- four names of God -- ""hallowed be your name"" -- and what they tell us about God. 1. God wants to supply my needs. -- Jehovah-Jireh, God my provider 2. God wants to forgive my faults. -- Jehovah-Tsidkenu, God is my righteousness. 3. God wants to relieve my stress -- Jehovah-Shalom, God is my peace. 4. God wants to heal my hurts -- Jehovah-Rophe, God is my healer. 1. JEHOVAH JIREH, GOD WANTS TO SUPPLY MY NEEDS Genesis 22, God is called 'Jehovah Jireh' meaning ""God is my provider."" We're all familiar with shortages in the world today. Shortages in your personal life. Time, money, energy."
Matthew 6:10,"('Prayer', 'Purpose', 'Father God', 'Prayer General', 'Needs Of Christians')",Church Of God," GOD'S PURPOSE FOR YOUR LIFE God Is The Answer to Your Deepest Needs Part 3 of 7 Matthew 6:10 A friend once asked Isidor I. Rabi, a Nobel Prize winner in science, how he became a scientist. Rabi replied that every day after school his mother would talk to him about his school day. She wasn't so much interested in what he had learned that day, but she always inquired, ""Did you ask a good question today?"" ""Asking good questions,"" Rabi said, ""made me become a scientist."" Often I find that people are asking many questions like What is life all about? Why am I here? Where am I going? What is the purpose of life? Why Did God place me here? Many of God's people spend their whole Christian life searching for the answers to these questions, but God's word tells us in Jeremiah 29:11 that God has a plan, a purpose for our lives. Many of God's people are depressed because they don't know or don't understand God's purpose and will for their lives. The prayer that Jesus taught His Disciples was to pray to God our Father: Matthew 6:10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. I'm convinced that many of the problems in our life come because we don't have a clear understanding of God's purpose and will for our life. It's as though you're driving somewhere and you come to an intersection, but before you can choose which way to go you've got to know where you're going.... It's no different in life, if you don't know where you're headed in life; any intersection is going to cause you a lot of confusion and insecurity. A lot of people are insecure because they don't have any purpose for life. Understanding God's purpose can be summed up in one sentence. Matthew 6:10 ""Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven."" There are two phrases here. The first phrase summarizes God's purpose for the world -- ""Your kingdom come"" -- that's God's purpose for the world. Ephesians 1:10 ""God's purpose, which he will complete when the time is right, is to bring all creation together with Christ as head."" History is moving toward a climax. The second phrase summarizes God's purpose for your life -- ""Your will be done"" -- God has a will, a plan, a purpose for your life. There is a purpose in life and God's going to bring it all together in the kingdom of God - that is to bring heaven and earth together. You ask What about now Pastor? What about me? What about my life? Does God have a purpose for my life? Yes, He does. In fact, God has four purposes for your life. 1. God made me to know Him. 2. God made me to be like Him. 3. God made me that I might serve Him. He's is God and He has a job for you to do. 4. God made me to live with Him -- to eventually go be with Him in heaven. 1. GOD MADE ME TO KNOW HIM Ephesians 1:4-5 ""Before the world was made God had already decided that through Jesus Christ he would bring us to himself as his children. This was his pleasure and purpose."" The fact is you did not choose to be born, that was beyond your control. You did not choose to be born, but God planned it and God had a purpose in it. The fact that you are alive today, that you're sitting here in this building, breathing and taking up space means God has a purpose for your life."
"Matthew 6:11, Philippians 4:6","('Anxiety', ""Lord's Prayer"", 'Father God', 'Needs Of Christians')",Church Of God," GOD'S ANTIDOTE FOR ANXIETY God Is Answer To Your Deepest Needs - Part 4 of 7 Matthew 6:11, Philippians 4:6 Matt 6:11 give us today our daily bread. Philippians 4:6 don't worry about anything, but in everything, through prayer and petition with thanksgiving; let your requests be made known to God. So far we have talked about God as our perfect Father. Our perfect Father is Caring, Consistent, Close, and Capable, therefore He is a reliable, trustworthy, Father that you can count on. Because God is our perfect Father is can and will meet our deepest needs. Also our perfect Father God has a Purpose for each of our lives. He wants us to know Him, Be like Him, Serve Him, and be with Him. This morning I want to share with you, ""God's Antidote to Your Anxiety"". So many people spend their time worrying about their daily needs. When Jesus taught His disciples to pray, ""Give us this day our daily bread"", He was teaching them to ask God for their daily provision. Our perfect Heavenly Father will take care of us one day at a time. He knows what we need each day to live our lives and be successful in life. Jesus is teaching His disciples that God's Antidote to their Anxiety is His daily provision. The Bible says in Proverbs, ""The anxiety in a heart brings a man down"" -- it weighs a heart down. The old English word for ""worry"" literally means to choke, to strangle. That's what worry does to us. Worry does not work. Worry is like a rocking chair - it gives you something to do, but gets you nowhere. Philippians 4:6 ""Don't worry about anything, instead pray about everything, tell God your needs."" That's the message in a sentence. God says, ""Don't worry, pray!"" God is saying why worry when you can pray? But what's the kind of prayer that I pray in order not to worry? Matthew 6:11 ""This is how you should pray, Give us today our daily bread."" Jesus gives three keys in how to overcome worry in that one little sentence. 1. Ask for God's assistance. ""Give us..."" Rather than worry, you ask God to help you out. 2. Remember God's resources. ""... Our daily bread..."" Bread is the basic food of life. It represents all of the necessities of life that you need. God has infinite resources to meet all your needs. 3. Trust God's timing. ""... Today... daily..."" not weekly bread, monthly bread, annual bread... ""Give us today our daily bread."" 1. ASK FOR GOD'S ASSISTANCE. Instead of worry, ask God for help. Worry is an attempt to control the uncontrollable. When you feel like you're helpless then you start worrying. But how much is out of God's control? Nothing. Absolutely nothing . What does God say to do? James 4:2 ""You do not have because you do not ask God!"" If we prayed as much as we worried, we'd have a lot less to worry about. Over 20 times in the New Testament, God says, ""Ask."" He wants you to ask. He's waiting for you to ask for His Assistance. How much more would you have if you just simply asked? You have not because you ask not. Why does God want us to ask? Because He is the source for everything that you need in life and when you ask for His assistance, you are saying God I need Your Help. Numbers 16:32 ""God is the source of all life."" God wants you to see Him as your source for all your needs."
Genesis 42:1-47:31,"('Reconciliation', 'Reunion', 'Rediscovering Joy')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," The Life of Joseph Reunion and Reconciliation in Egypt Genesis 42-47 David Taylor November 20, 2016 We finish up our series on ""The Life of Joseph"" next week and start our Advent series, ""Rediscovering Joy"" during the month of December. Today's message, ""Reunion and Reconciliation in Egypt,"" we look at Genesis chapters 42-47. Last week, we saw Joseph go from prison to the palace in a matter of hours. Life has finally turned sweet for Joseph, he is now the prime minister of Egypt, married, and has two sons. The first, Manasseh, meaning God has made him forget all his hardships and all his father's house and the second, Ephraim, meaning God has made him fruitful in the land of his affliction (41:51-53). And Egypt is experiencing just what Joseph predicted, the seven years of prosperity are over and they are into two years of famine. But the famine includes all the surrounding lands (41:54) who must come to Egypt seeking grain for survival (41:54-57). When Jacob learns that there is grain in Egypt he sends all the brothers to buy grain except Benjamin because He fears for his life (42:1-4). I think deep down he does not trust the brothers because he suspects they were behind Joseph's death. So, the brothers go to Egypt and must see Joseph who is in charge of selling grain. And when they do, they bow before the second most powerful man in Egypt, not realizing he is Joseph because everything about him is Egyptian, his looks, his mannerisms, and his dress. But Joseph recognizes them. He acts rough toward them, accusing them of being spies but they defend themselves, stating that they are honest men! Joseph is testing them; he does not trust them after what they did to him. He needs to find out what kind of men they are twenty years later. He inquiries about Benjamin and Jacob and tells them that if they are honest men, leave one brother in Egypt and bring back their other brother when they return. Their guilt causes them to interpret their circumstances as punishment for selling Joseph into slavery sin (42:21). Joseph turns away, weeping because of the emotion of this encounter and his brother's words (42:24). They leave to return home so Joseph's steward puts their money back in their sacks which they find on their trip home. They obviously fear for lives, believing that God is behind the money being there (42:28). Those who do evil cannot escape punishment forever. When they get low run on grain again they make plans to return to Egypt to buy grain but they must take Benjamin with them. Jacob is very uncomfortable with this as he cannot bear the possibility of losing Benjamin so Judah guarantees Benjamins return with his own life (43:8-9). Jacob finally concedes, trusting God's sovereignty despite not trusting the brothers (43:14). So the brothers take a second journey to Egypt and come before Joseph again. When he sees Benjamin with them he has his steward take them into his house and prepare a meal for them (43:16-17). They are afraid that he has it in for them because of the money in their sacks so they question the steward and explain to him about finding the money in their sacks and that they brought it back, along with more money to buy grain. But the steward tells them not to fear, your God and the God of your father has put treasure in your sacks for you (43:18- 23). What does this tell us about Joseph? Though he left his family, he has not left God. The mission of God was central to his life, even in Egypt. When Joseph arrives, the brothers give him the gift they brought and bow down before him, fulfilling the first dream (43:26). Then they sit down to eat, he at one table and they at another as Egyptians did not eat with Jews (43:32). They are seated in birth order (43:33) with Benjamin getting five times as much food as the rest (43:34). He is testing his bothers to see how they will react to the youngest being favored. Will they respond the same way they did toward him so many years before? Joseph did not know this yet but the brothers will need to be united for the nation of Israel to become strong and God is ensuring this unity through Joseph. God is using Joseph to accomplish this purpose."
"Matthew 6:12, 1 John 1:9","('Forgiveness', ""Lord's Prayer"", 'Needs Of Christians', 'Freedom From Sin', 'Forgiven')",Church Of God," Freedom Through Forgiveness God's Answer to Your Deepest Needs - Part 5 of 7 Matthew 6:12 and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. This Morning I want us to look at "" Freedom Through Forgiveness"". One of the greatest needs in our lives is the need for forgiveness. Many people struggle with feelings of guilt, shame and fear. The reason we struggle with these feelings is because we have sinned against a Holy God. God's word tells us that all have sinned and come short of God's glory. God's word also tells us that the wages of sin is death, but thank God the scripture doesn't stop there. If it did we would all be hopelessly lost forever. It goes on to say, "" But the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord "". There is "" Freedom "" from Guilt, shame and fear through "" Forgiveness"". 1 John 1:9 says, "" If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. But before I get into the heart of this message I want you to notice three things about this scripture. 1.) If we confess our sins. Forgiveness is conditioned upon our confession of the sin that is in our lives. Not if we make excuses for our sin or blame someone else for our sin. We take personal responsibilities for our sins and confess them to God. 2.) He is Faithful and just to forgive us. That simply means that you can count on God to forgive you and cancel the debt of your sin and release you from the penalty of your sins. He is ""Faithful and just"" The death of Jesus Christ on the Cross provides the grounds for our forgiveness. 3.) Not only will God forgive you but God will also cleanse you of all unrighteousness. I like what Hebrews 10:22 says in The New Living Translation let us go right into the presence of God, with true hearts fully trusting him. For our evil consciences have been sprinkled with Christ's blood to make us clean, and our bodies have been washed with pure water. When we confess our sins not only does God forgive us, He also gives us a clear conscience and washes us with the pure water of His word. There's only one way to have Freedom from our guilt shame and fear and that is through forgiveness. Freedom through Forgiveness, and there's only one source for forgiveness and that is Jesus Christ. And there's only one way to get forgiveness. Ask for it. Matthew 6:12 ""This is how you should pray, "" Forgive us our debts"". How do you get rid of guilt? It's simple. You ask God. You ask for forgiveness. Have you ever confessed a sin, maybe many, many times, but still feel guilty about it? Why is it that sometimes you confess something, you admit it to God but you still feel guilty? The problem is that many people don't understand how God forgives. They don't really understand or believe how God forgives. There is real Freedom Through Forgiveness when you understand how God forgives. I want us to look at four ways that God Forgives us this morning. 1. God forgives instantly. 2. God forgives completely. He utterly wipes everything out. Completely."
"Matthew 6:13, 1 Corinthians 10:13","('Temptation', ""Lord's Prayer"", 'Father God', 'Temptation General', 'Needs Of Christians')",Church Of God," HOW TO TRIUMPH OVER TEMPTATION God's Answer to Your Deepest Needs - Part 6 of 7 Matthew 6:13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Temptation is the world's oldest problem. It's been around since Adam and Eve. We all have our weaknesses. It may be our Temper, eating to much, spending to much and a host of other things that I could name. We all have certain areas in our lives that we need help to control. The good news is that God says, ""I want to help you to gain control of those areas in your life. I want to help you overcome temptation."" 1 Corinthians 10:13 (Good News) ""Every temptation that comes your way is the kind that normally comes to people. But God keeps His promises and He will not allow you to be tempted beyond your power to resist. At the time you are tempted he will give you the strength to endure it and so provide you with a way out."" That's a great promise! This tells us a lot about temptation. Temptation is normal. It happens to everybody. We're all in the same boat. Everybody's tempted. If there are common temptations, there are common solutions. People say, ""I was in a situation and I just had no choice."" Oh, yeah? God says you can overcome it regardless of what the temptation is. God has given us everything that we need to over come temptation. If we yield to temptation it is because we choose to. So, how does God deliver us from evil? Five ways: 1. Refuse to be intimidated. Don't let the devil bully you around. 2. Ask for God's help. 3. Refocus your attention. Put your mind on something else. Change your mind. 4. Talk about your struggle with a friend. 5. Resist the tempter. Not the temptation but the tempter. 1. REFUSE TO BE INTIMIDATED Ephesians 6:10-11 ""Be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power. Put on the full armor of God so you can take your stand against the devil's schemes. There are three common reactions when we're tempted: 1. Alarm. How could I think such a thing? 2. Frustration. I keep falling in the same area. 3. Discouragement. I'm never going to be able to change. Satan's number one strategy is to intimidate you. It is not a sin to be tempted. It's a sin to give in to temptation. The Bible says even Jesus was tempted. The Bible says ""He was tempted in all points as we, yet He sinned not."" It has been said you cannot keep the birds from flying over your head, but you can keep them from building a nest in your hair. You can't keep all the thoughts the devil wants to put in your mind out of your mind but you can reject them. Have you ever been praying and all of a sudden the most off the wall idea from left field comes into your mind? You think you must not even be a Christian.Where did you get an idea like that? The devil. You don't have to feel guilty about it. It's what you do with it that makes a difference. You'll never outgrow temptation. The closer you get to the Lord, the more the devil is going to work on you. Notice the terminology here. ""Be strong... mighty power... put on full armor... take your stand."" The Christian life is a battle. It is tough. The words used to describe the Christian life are words like fight, conquer, strive, battle, overcome, and victory. Satan wants to intimidate you. He wants you to feel guilty just for being tempted."
Genesis 50:15-26,"(""God's Word"", 'Final Words', 'Thumbprint Of God', 'Gods Good Purposes')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," The Life of Joseph Joseph's Final Words Genesis 50:15-26 David Taylor November 27, 2016 There is a proverb that says the same sun that melts wax hardens clay. It's a way of saying that the same circumstances can cause different responses in people to make them bitter or better, wounded or stronger. We all know people who have had very difficult lives or seasons in their lives and some are the better because of it and others are the worse because of it. By the time Joseph is thirty years old, he could have let life get the best of him but in fact it is quite the opposite, he has been strengthened and prepared to fulfill God's purpose in Egypt. Let's look at that today. We are in the final chapter of Genesis, 50, of our series on ""The Life of Joseph"" with ""Joseph's Final Words."" Next week we start a four-week series, ""Rediscovering Joy"" during the month of December. If you have your bibles, turn to Genesis 50. Jacobs extended family has been in Egypt almost twenty years, Jacob has died, and Joseph's brothers fear that he will seek revenge now that his father has died. So they tell Joseph that Jacob commanded before his death that Joseph forgive the brothers for their sins because of the evil they did to him. His response is to cry because after all these years of taking care of them, they still do not trust him. Listen to Joseph's response, ""do not fear, for am I in the place of God? As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today. So do not fear; I will provide for you and your little ones."" Thus, he comforted them and spoke kindly to them (15-17). First he tells them not to fear because he is not in the place of God, that is, God is the one who avenges sin and evil. Scripture tells us that God is just and will avenge evil so we do not need to do so (Rom 12:19; 1 Thes 5:15; 1 Pet 4:19) either in this life or the next. His point is that they do not need to fear because he will not set himself up as God. God will get justice in hell or in Christ. When we seek revenge, we set ourselves up as God thinking we can do a better job than He can. We often think that way. For instance, when someone says or does something hurtful to us, we want to hurt them in return. But Joseph has forgiven them. Then he tells them why he is able to forgive them. As for you, you meant evil against me but God meant it for good to save many as he has over the last twenty years! How we see life, the good and the bad under Gods providential care, God's overruling and trumping evil, determines how we think, feel, and ultimately respond to the difficulties of life. As Joseph looked back on the evil in his life, his brothers jealousy of him (37:11), their hate of him (37:4, 5, 8), planning to kill him (37:20) but ultimately selling him into slavery (37:28) which led Joseph to being a slave in Egypt (39:1), then falsely accused (39:11-18), and imprisoned (39:20), forgotten for two years after helping the cup bearer (40:23), which set him up to be the right man at the right time, in the right place and under the right circumstances to become the Prime Minister of Egypt (41:9-45). As he looked back at his life, he saw the thumbprint of God all over it. Before time began God had determined that this should happen was working his plan out in history in a way that his brothers are still responsible for their evil actions. We rarely see the big picture while our story is being written or played out. It is usually later, often much later that we see and understand the hand of God. So we are called to live by faith, believing that all things work out for our good (Rom 8:28) because we often cannot see God's good purposes when we are in circumstances that are dark and painful and won't go away. What the brothers did was morally wrong, sinful, and evil. Their intent was to cause him great harm but God overrides their evil intents for Joseph's good (see also Jonah 1:17, 2:3; Acts 2:23; 3:13-17; 4:2-28). So their sin against Joseph is not good in and of itself but it is used for good to serve a larger and grander purpose - that Jacob's family be kept alive. Their evil intent unwittingly fulfilled God's purpose of sending Joseph to Egypt to become the Prime Minister of Egypt which gave him the power to save his family and provide for them in Egypt. Evil exists to accomplish the greater good than would not exist if he had not determined evil should exist. Evil ultimately exists to magnify god's grace and glory that could not be displayed if sin had not existed. This is the Christian narrative. God created everything and it was good. Humanity sinned and sin is the cause of everything wrong in the world today. It is the cause of the struggle that goes on in our hearts every day; the conflict in personal relationships and geopolitical ones; murder and war; and the list goes on and on and on. Yet God chose to reverse the curse of sin by choosing to work through one man, Abraham, and his family to save the nations through the gospel so that all of us who trust in Christ are now heirs of Abraham (Gal 3:29)."
John 2:13-23,"('Temple', 'The Temple Of God', 'The Temple Of The Holy Spirit')",Assembly Of God," The Zeal for the House of God (The Life of Christ Series) 01.29.17 Introduction In recent weeks we have talked a lot about your body being your Temple, and the habitation (dwelling) of Christ and the Holy Spirit. This teaching is very important in our spiritual life. Our personal relationship with Jesus is dependent and determined by our giving a place within our body for the presence of God. With that - Would Christ want to live within you if your life were filled with garbage bags? Let me answer that for all of us - NO! Let explain this with a story in the Life of Christ. Text: John 2:13 thru 23 Prayer: This passage of scripture speaks of there being a constructed building while Jesus was here on Earth. This building was beautiful and was known to everyone as the Temple of the Lord. In this text, we find ourselves in the early days of Jesus' earthly ministry. Jesus had a certain excitement mixed with authority to be in the House of God, i.e. The Temple of the Lord. After all, it's His House We are talking about. God's House doesn't belong to the Jews, or the Palestinians, or the Christians, or any one person or a denomination. It's simply God's House. This is God's House. We are gathered here to worship God in His House. You and I are responsible for taking care of God's House. I would have liked to have seen the House of God (the Temple) that day, and to walk through the doors and to see everything. Especially to see Jesus in His Temple. The Son of God and King of Kings! The building we meet in each week is the Temple where we worship Jesus. Question - Have you ever found yourself excited to come to God's House? Jesus has excitement and authority to meet with us here is this room. This place of worship does not belong to me or you. Or even the one whose name is written on the deed over at the courthouse. We pay rent with your tithes and offerings so we can call this God's House, and we can meet here and worship Jesus and be filled with the Holy Spirit. We Don't have to go to Jerusalem. Jesus is here! Jesus has a vested interest in this building. What the disciples saw that day in Jesus, they had never seen in Him before. As the disciples remembered - so should we: Vs. 17 - ""Zeal (Passion) for your house will consume me!"" Each of us should have a ""Zeal"" (a Passion) for the things of God, the House of God, the ways of God and the people of God. Here is what we can see in these verses: I. Jesus went to the Temple. A. Notice the first thing Jesus does when He arrives in Jerusalem is to get on down to God's house. Nothing else is more important Than to get to God's House. Jesus (at another time) clearly tells us to ""Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you."" Jesus illustrates for us what our priorities should be. Does Jesus have the same desire to find His way to your Temple? Your Holy Temple? Have you ever noticed that - Oftentimes there are other things taking place that can interfere with getting to the House God? B. (in our text) Jesus had to have noticed that there were many other Jewish festivities taking place all over Jerusalem. There was music, food, fun and fellowship in the streets. Almost a carnival atmosphere. Everybody is looking for a good time."
Mark 7:1-8,"('Traditions Of Men', 'Traditions', 'Questioning', ""Man's Rules"")",Evangelical Free," We had been learning from the Gospel of Mark. Although we are currently in the middle of Chapter 6, we will look at the beginning of Mark 7 this morning in preparation for Communion. We will come back to Chapter 6 next week. Please open your Bibles to Mark 7..... We have noted in earlier chapters of the Gospel of Mark how quickly the Jewish religious Leaders were jealous of Jesus and were always trying to trip Him up; they were afraid of losing their lofty positions). We will note in our passage today another thing they found religiously wrong with Jesus. Read along with me Mark 7:1-8.... v1-4: Jesus' disciples (His followers) were caught not following religious traditions as seen by the Jewish leaders! Now, Jesus had been proclaiming that He is the Son of God (Jesus is God!); but yet, v5: The Jewish Religious Leaders directly confronted Jesus! Let's pause and think about this for a moment; If Jesus walked the earth today, would people bow down to Him or confront and ridicule Him? In general, how did Jesus respond to the accusation?? a. Jesus cited God's Words (Scripture)! b. Jesus made them think of their inner being, what God sees! Their hearts were not right with their talk and actions! All of us do this don't we; we all have a tendency to just think of the physical and ignore the spiritual. Besides questioning the Son of God, what else did the religious leaders specifically do wrong? v7a: worshipped God in vain (self-pleasing worship instead of God pleasing)! Do people do this in churches today? Can people actually go to church but then just please themselves instead of God? God sees our inner attitudes! v7b: taught man-made rules instead of God's! v8a: actually ignored God's Word! v8b: they focused on traditions! What about us today? 1. Is it possible for us to directly confront Jesus, who is God? How? We must always humble ourselves before God! 2. Always consider what God sees in our hearts, especially in our worship and our view of people! 3. Is our worship truly God focused or do we do it just to feel good about ourselves? 4. Watch out for man-made rules and traditions instead of God. 5. God is only pleased with our faith in His Words (the Bible)! How are we treating God's love letter to us on a daily basis?"
Mark 1:16-20,"('Discipleship', 'Witnesses Of Jesus')",Assembly Of God," THAT WE MIGHT BE LIKE HIM A lot can be learned about someone by talking to the friends who are closest to them. There are people that I am close to that know me very well, and there are others who know me only by name, but they don't really know me. The people who know me best know my shortcomings. The 12 disciples traveled with Jesus for over 3 years ... the disciples knew Him. We do know that there were 4 of them who wrote an autobiography about that man, Jesus of Nazareth. Look in your Bible and you will find the Book(s) of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Those books were written by men who knew Jesus very well. They documented a lot about Jesus.... ... but not once was there anything ever said that was negative about Jesus. I am not so sure that I would want 4 of my best friends to write a book about me. What about you? Let's look at some of what the disciple, Mark, wrote about Jesus.... Text: Mark 1:16 - 20; 3:13 - 19 In chapter 3 we can find some information on a few of the disciples. Of the 12 disciples, Jesus identified specifically Simon and Andrew as fishermen, and James and John as fishermen that were known as the ""Sons of Thunder"". Just common people trying to make a living catching fish. All these were known for was hard work, and not for anything else... And there was Judas Iscariot What an unreliable low life he must have been. He was not known for anything else except maybe a thief and a scoundrel... Judas was known as ""the one who betrayed (Jesus)"". More importantly - these guys are appointed by Jesus. God really is amazing with what He plays for nobodies lie you and me Look again at verse 14. Jesus chose 12 disciples ""WHO MIGHT BE WITH HIM."" A dozen men ""WHO MIGHT BE WITH HIM"". I'm sure Jesus knew these men and their past... Jesus knew all of the mistakes they had each made with their lives. Nevertheless Jesus wanted them to follow Him...regardless of their shortcomings. So then - Let's just say that Jesus would come to you and He would call you out by your name (just as He had done with the other 12 men) What if Jesus would come to you and call you out from your former life? If Jesus listed your name along with the other 12 Disciples, what do you suppose Jesus would have to say? What if Jesus were to suddenly show up at your workplace, and call you out just as He had done to the other 12 disciples? Jesus' reason for calling you out by name would be no different than the 12 disciples... just so you ""MIGHT BE WITH HIM?"" Example Recently our new President chose certain men and women to become very close to him and assist him in leading this country and ""MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN"". We all have seen this on TV or the internet. It is interesting that very few people knew the cabinet members before the election, but the world certainly knows them now... Likewise, before Jesus came to you and called you out, we all were nobody's. Jesus had a good reason for choosing you. Jesus was hoping that you ""MIGHT BE WITH HIM"". Anyone who decides to follow Jesus (i.e., a disciple) would have to be willing to forsake all. Nothing else would matter in their lives, but to ""BE WITH HIM""."
Matthew 17:1-4,"('Jesus Is Lord', 'Jesus Is Your Friend', 'Jesus Is Your Lord')",Assembly Of God," THE LEADING OF CHRIST Being a disciple of Christ is very important to the Plan of God. Trying to navigate on your own (without God) can be a mistake. When my wife and I travel we usually take our Garmen Navigation and sit it on the dash of our car. We try not to get lost, but it happens... and it's usually my fault. Hey, it's a guy thing. I enjoy going places I have not been to before, but I don't like to get lost. I have discovered it is much easier to go places with people that have been there before. Note: In your daily life, being a Disciple/Follower of Christ you will never lose your way. JESUS has been there and LEADS US with every step. Regardless of the path you are on, in the desert, or a dark forest, JUST KEEP FOLLOWING JESUS. TEXT: Matthew 17:1 - 4 Last Sunday - we looked at the miracle of Jesus with the blind man. It was extraordinary. The disciples were watching Jesus very carefully when Jesus prayed twice for the blind man. At first the blind man's eyes were blurry and distorted, and then Jesus prayed a second time. Afterwards, the Bible tells us the blind man could see ""clearly"". Seeing Jesus ""clearly"" is important for each of us to do if we are going to understand what message Christ is giving to all of His disciples. Today - Our scriptures are unique in that Christ chose 3 of the 12 disciples to follow Him ""into an high mountain apart."" One can only wonder why Jesus chose only 3... but then I am still in awe why Jesus chose me to follow Him way back in 1968... and then (really) why did Jesus choose you when He did? ""...into an high mountain, apart..."" This morning I want to tell you what you will learn if you choose to follow THE LEADING OF CHRIST: 1. JESUS IS YOUR FRIEND the Disciples were there when Jesus said (in John 15), ""Greater love has no man than this, that someone lay down His life for His friend."" It was the Cross of Calvary where Christ proved His friendship that He has with you and me. It wasn't just that moment in time, but rather His friendship is eternal. Jesus recognizes you when you look into His eyes. You are not a stranger to Him, at all. He will never betray His friendship with you. Jesus is much more than an acquaintance or someone you might know on FaceBook, text message, Tweeter, etc. Our culture has taught us to be too casual... and distant with being a friend. 2. JESUS IS YOUR LORD AND MASTER. Following Jesus the disciples had seen the Authority of Christ many times. Our submitting to His Authority is our first act of obedience. Jesus rules everything in your life, in your world and in your heart. To kneel or bow in His presence is proof of your submission to Jesus your Lord and Master. At the age of 12, Jesus made known His Authority (of being Lord) when He remained in Jerusalem after Joseph and Mary left Him in Jerusalem. When Joseph and Mary finally found Jesus He asked them, ""Did you not know that I must be about MY Father's business?"" That may have sounded odd coming from a 12 year old boy. The disciples saw up close when Jesus declared Himself as, ""LORD of the Sabbath""."
John 7:37-39,"('Promise', 'Transformation', 'Feast Of Tabernacles')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," The Holy Spirit: Learn, Unlearn, Relearn The Promise of the Holy Spirit, part 1 John 7:37-39 David Taylor January 8, 2016 Today we start a new series, The Holy Spirit: Learn, Unlearn, and Relearn. The goal is to learn about the person and the work of the Holy Spirit, to unlearn wrong views about the person and work of the Holy Spirit, and relearn biblical views of the person and work of the Spirit. The Spirit is often misunderstood, not understood, and incorrectly understood. It is the feast of the Tabernacles or Booths (7:2), one of Israel's three big feasts besides Passover and Pentecost. It is the most joyous feast and was said that if you never attended the feast, you did not know what joy was. The feast was associated with both God's provision in the harvest and his provision in the wilderness. During the feast, most of the Jews in Jerusalem would set up and live in booths, tents essentially, for seven days as a reminder that they were pilgrims before they entered the promised land. Then on the eighth day, they would take down the booths and celebrate that they were no longer pilgrims. The high point was the high priest filling a gold pitcher with water from the pool of Siloam and leading a procession of musicians and singers into the temple and pouring that water into a bowl next to altar, thanking God for his provision of the harvest. Rabbi's added an additional tradition about two hundred years before Christ that the pouring out of the water was an expectation that God would pour out his Spirit in the last days. John tells us that it was the last day of the feast when things were winding down. People were taking down their booths and packing up when Jesus stands up in the temple and makes this claim, ""If anyone thirsts let him come to me and drink (37)."" On their minds is God's miraculous provision of bread from heaven and water from the rock that sustained them in the wilderness and their looking forward to a coming Messianic Deliverer. Then he explains what he means by coming and drinking with ""whoever believes in me (38)."" Believing in Jesus is coming to him to meet deepest need of the human heart, reconciliation with God. Believing also is a drinking or receiving what Jesus offers. So believing is a trusting in or banking your hope on him. It is to embrace him and his word, to stake your life on him. The result of believing is that out of your heart will flow rivers of living water. This promise is the fulfillment of the Old Testament, ""as the Scripture says, out of his belly will flow rivers of living water (38)."" The water he promises and gives not only quenches human thirst but wells up from within that person so that they are completely transformed. Jesus used similar language in his encounter with the woman at the well (4:13-14). Water in a desert climate is critical for life and survival. Jesus is alluding to many Old Testament texts that speak of a coming promise of water giving life. But one I want us to look at one particular passage, Nehemiah 9. This text also is during the Feast of Tabernacles and Ezra is reminding the people how God miraculously delivered them in the Exodus through Red Sea and led them in the wilderness (9-12), gave them the law and miraculously provided bread and water in the wilderness (13-15). And when they rebelled against God he did not forsake them because of his great mercy (16-19) but gave his good Spirit to instruct them, while not withholding his miraculous bread and water to sustain them for forty years in the wilderness (20-21). Jesus is saying that he is the ultimate fulfillment of the bread (John 6:35) and the water (7:39) that God provided. But this water does more than just quench your thirst, it transforms everything about those who believe."
Philippians 2:5-7,"(""Christ's Exaltation"", 'Exaltation Of Jesus', 'Humility Of Christ')",Assembly Of God," THE GLORIOUS BIRTH OF CHRIST Open: History and Lyrics of ""What Child is This?"" What child is this who lay to rest On Mary's lap, ... He is sleeping This, this is Christ the King Whom shepherds guard and angels sing Haste, haste to bring him laud The Babe, the Son of Mary The Holy Scriptures contain the story and revelation of the coming of the King of Israel. Throughout the Bible, this incredible event is documented, declared, prophesied, and promised over and over. ... making sure that every man, woman, boy and girl knows (without any doubt) that the Birth of Jesus is the greatest story ever told. The plan of God to redeem the world is all about the Christ Child, and the Christmas Story that transcends all of time. God sent His only Son to be born in Bethlehem. At that very moment, all of mankind glorifies ""the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in the manger"". There are many passages of scripture that proclaim the glory of the Coming of the King. This includes what was written by the Apostle Paul to the Church at Philippi TEXT: Philippians 2:5 - 7 I would encourage us all to make this time of Christmas a special time to draw ever closer to Jesus Christ, our Lord. God may want to do something very special for you and your family this Christmas. Christ deserves our attention everyday of the year, but Christmas should be an exceptional time of the year for us (as we sense the wonderful presence of Christ.) Consider this: God works on us all in various ways at various times of the year. It has been my experience that God can easily catch us off guard with what He has planned for our lives. God challenges everyday of the year. Here is the reason why God does some of the things He does: God desires for you and I to be more like His Son everyday. Notice Verse 5 (of our text), ""Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus"". Simply put, we have a lot in common with Christ. Did you know that: 1. Christ came to Earth much the same way you and I came to Earth. 2. Christ lived on Earth much the same way we live. 3. Christ (also) left this Earth much the same way we will one day leave this planet. God intended our lives to similar to the life of Christ. God intended you to be Jesus. And that is why God sent Jesus to Earth. That is - for Christ to experience life on Earth much the same way you and I experience life. Let me explain: There are two primary periods of time in the Life of Christ: The EXALTATION of Christ, and the HUMILITY of Christ... 1. The Exaltation of the King: Luke? ?2:13-14???? ""And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying: ""Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace, goodwill toward men!"" ??We know that it wasn't just the angelic host (that glorified Christ). When the Christ Child came to this Earth, the Wise Men followed the Star to Bethlehem. These Wise Men came from the East to bring the Baby Jesus Gold, Frankincense and Myrh. And, when they saw the Christ Child, the Wise Men fell down and worshipped Him.??????"
John 2:23-3:8,"('Transformation', 'The Human Condition', 'Spiritually Alive')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," The Holy Spirit: Learn, Unlearn, Relearn The Work of the Spirit in the New Birth, part 2 John 2:23-3:8 David Taylor January 15, 2016 We started a new series last week, The Holy Spirit: Learn, Unlearn, and Relearn. The goal is to learn about the person and the work of the Holy Spirit, to unlearn wrong understandings about the person and work of the Holy Spirit, and relearn biblical understanding of the person and work of the Spirit. We are starting with the work of the Spirit in us as we come to faith, then the work of the Spirit in spiritual growth, then we will move to the work of the Spirit in ministry and mission, and then we will close with the unpardonable sin. This week I want us to look at ""The work of the Spirit in the New Birth"" from the gospel of John chapter three where Jesus describes God working behind the scenes when someone comes to faith. John tells us while ""Jesus was in Jerusalem many believed in his name because they saw the signs he was doing (2:23)."" One would think Jesus would be happy about this but John says that ""Jesus did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people and he knew what was in man (2:24-25)."" There is something wrong with the human condition that Jesus did not entrust himself to those who believed in him. Paul gives us insight into the human condition in Ephesians, ""And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience-- among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind (2:1-3)."" Then one of those who believed, a Pharisee and ruler of the Jews came to Jesus (3:1). He was a member of the Sanhedrin, Israel's supreme court of seventy religious who were the final authority concerning the law of God. They made the decision to hand Jesus over to the Roman authorities to be crucified. He was well educated, a well known teacher, and probably very wealthy. But Jesus has a similar opinion of these religious leaders as he does about the rest of humanity. In Matthew twenty-three Jesus says this about them, ""Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel across sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes a proselyte, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves (23:15)."" ""Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence (23:25)."" ""You serpents, you brood of vipers, how are you to escape being sentenced to hell (23:33)?"" Listen to what Nicodemus says, ""Rabbi we know that you are a teacher from God for no one can do these signs or miracles unless God is with him (3:2)."" The Pharisees had been discussing this teacher and miracle worker and concluded that Jesus must be from God."
Romans 1:20-21,"('Truth', 'Facts Vs Truth', 'Truth Of God')",Assembly Of God," THE FACTS AND THE TRUTH Last week we talked about Doubting Thomas in John 20. Jesus spoke emphatically to Thomas (and us) ""Stop Doubting - Start Believing"". Evidently some doubt while others believe. 1. Doubting - closely connected with how we rationalize things in our brain. We rely on our intellect and logic to sort things. These things are only for this life and are temporary in relevance. We think but it is not necessary to believe. In fact, in time we may even change our mind about what we think. We go to the world for our facts... 2. Believing - We rely completely on the authority of God's Word. We sense with our heart what is absolutely the TRUTH. TRUTH is eternal. God never changes His mind about what He has said. We go to God for our TRUTH. Illustration: Recent article being printed and read all over the world regarding some FACTS that NASA has been telling us since 2010. ETC. So then - Does Jesus want us to Doubt? Or does He want us to Believe? Let me share with you a few simple TRUTHs you can build your life with and believe... TEXT: Romans 1: 20 - 21 1. People in the Old Testament agreed on what was told them by the Prophets of their time. 2. The Laws of Moses were told to them. Do this but don't do this. 3. The people of the O.T. did not always Believe God for TRUTH. 4. They had a fear relationship with God. God's relationship with mankind was frustrating. What was God to do? TEXT: JOHN 1:1 - 3, verse 14 God provided you and I with a plan that did not rely on how smart we were, or just a list of things we were told to do. God's New Plan was for Mankind to: A) Stop living by the Laws of Moses B) Start living by the eternal TRUTH's of God's Word (Jesus) C) Live in the freedom and security of knowing and believing but without any doubt. Question: 1. Have you ever watched someone really struggling with being a Christian? 2. Have you ever wondered how it is that other people can totally believe God? 3. Why is it that some Believe and others want to Believe? Text: Hebrews 1:1 - 2 (This can be easy to remember in that both scriptures are found in the first chapter and verse of John and now Hebrews. This teaching must have been for both who wrote John and Hebrews.) 1. Here - Jesus has taken charge of your belief just as He did for Thomas. Jesus does not want you to Doubt, but He is not going to condemn you. Jesus (in Truth) is willing to help you to Believe, and not Doubt. In Mark 9 - Jesus was brought to Him the little boy who was a demoniac that even the disciples could not help. After Jesus delivered the boy from his demons, the father said to Jesus, ""Jesus help my unbelief."" I have noticed in MY walk with God something that maybe you have noticed in your walk with God. It is similar to what the father of the little boy experienced when he met Jesus that day. And that is this: As soon as the little boy was delivered of all those demons, his father realized that he had ""unbelief"" in his life/heart. Each of us has at one point or another have struggled with ""unbelief"". Perhaps you don't realize (yourself) how big of a struggle ""unbelief"" is your heart, as well."
Acts 2:41-42,"('Spirit-Filled Life', 'Filled With The Holy Spirit', 'They Continued Steadfastly')",Assembly Of God," SPIRIT FILLED FELLOWSHIP This message is different. Most times we talk about our personal relationship with God, but today I want to speak directly about our personal relationship with each other. Last week we talked briefly about how things changed after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Did you know that there was not a church to be found anywhere...actually for thousands of years. In the Old Testament, people came to worship at the local synagogue or at Solomon's Temple (in Jerusalem). The people did not know God very well and depended on the High Priest to forgive their sins (with bloody sacrifices of bulls, lambs or doves. Things changed dramatically (in the book of Acts) for the people worshipping God. Approximately 120 followers of Christ were gathered on the Day of Pentecost, in Acts 2. The Bible says that the Holy Spirit suddenly fell on the people that were gathered. It was an explosive event for the New Testament Church. The people of God had never seen or heard anything like this before. Here were the results of that day: TEXT: Acts 2:41 - 42(a) ""They devoted themselves..."" Another translation - ""committed themselves"" This is what God wanted for His people in the Book of Acts at the First New Testament Church in downtown Jerusalem! This is what God still wants for New Life Church in downtown Shelbyville! Peter, James and John had never started a church before, but they were blessed (overnight) with 3000 people who wanted to commit their lives and souls to Jesus Christ, the newly Risen King! There would be no going back to the Temple or the synagogue. Imagine what this must have been like with 3000 unchurched and unsaved people coming to church for the first time...rushing to speak to a handful of disciples about how to be saved...how to obey God...who Jesus Christ was...what happened to Him...where did he go? When is He coming back? Oh, and do you have anyone to take my children? Do you have a FoodBank? Can you help me with my rent this month? What made the difference for this new Fellowship of Believers? 1. They were filled with the Holy Spirit. 2. KJV - ""They continued steadfastly in the Apostle's doctrine and fellowship..."" QUESTION: Could this suddenly happen to us here in Big Springs Plaza? Why not? We keep telling ourselves: ""God is the same yesterday, today and forever!"" I can only give to you the Truth of God's Word and tell you to believe it. Acts 2 is the historical and biblical Truth of what happened in that first Spirit-Filled New Testament Church. The fact is there are many who try to come to join a church. They come to us from all kinds of backgrounds. Most people (coming into the church) don't know what to expect, or what is expected of them. Here's an example of the struggles of some churches: In the last couple of months I have spoken to 2 different people from 2 very different churches in 2 very rural towns here in Tennessee. They each told me about their church and how they are struggling to keep their doors opened. They both are over 100 years old and both are listed with the US Historical Landmarks. They both are loosing members and seldom ever get any visitors."
Romans 8:14-17,"('Adoption', 'Abba', 'Gods Family')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," The Holy Spirit: Learn, Unlearn, Relearn Adoption by the Spirit, part 3 Romans 8:14-17 David Taylor February 5, 2017 We are in our third week of our series, The Holy Spirit: Learn, Unlearn, and Relearn. My desire is that we gain a biblical understanding of life in the Spirit and our radical need for the person and work of the Holy Spirit in our lives. Someone made a comment to me that I was not focusing enough on the Spirit in the first two messages. Here is the deal, the work of God in the lives of his people is the work of the triune God working together. They are one God in essence yet three persons. So to say something is the work of the Spirit is to say it is the work of God. This is how the bible describes the work of the trinity. God the Father ordains all that is to come to pass, those things coming to pass are based upon the work of the Son, Jesus Christ, and the Spirit applies the work of the Son to individuals. So the work of the Spirit is to glorify the Son by applying the work of the Son to individuals that God has ordained to come to pass. So far we have seen that the Spirit is the source of all spiritual life in John 7; the Spirit gives us new birth in John 3; and this week we will look at another great work of the Spirit, adopting us into the family of God. Adoption is the work of the Spirit, applying everything that the Son secured for us on the cross in which we become children of God. There are no natural born children in God's family. All of us were orphans in terrible circumstances with an even more terrifying future. This passage points out three characteristics of spiritual adoption. The first is that we have a new status (15). ""You did not receive a spirit of slavery to the power and guilt of sin so that you fall back into fear of God's judgment and uncertainty. Instead, you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out Abba father (15)."" Adoption is the act of God's grace in which he freely brings us into membership of his family, and makes us partakers of all the blessings he has provided, including the love he has for his own Son Jesus Christ (John 17:23) which is poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit (Rom 5:5). In God adopting us, the Spirit applies what the Son secured for us on the cross so that we become children of God and securing everything Jesus secured. Our adoption was ordained by God in eternity past, secured for us by the work of the Son on the cross, and applied to our behalf by the Spirit so that we have the same standing as Jesus (Eph 1:3-6). This is not something we can earn or gain by our own morality, as if we are good enough to gain God's favor; it is purely the work of God's grace. We are adopted as the Spirit applies the work of Jesus on our behalf. Jesus was abandoned on the cross so you could be and would be adopted. The word received here is a passive verb, meaning that God is the agent in adoption or God has acted on our behalf in adopting us. As a past act we are now children of God with the same standing as Jesus Christ because of what he has done for us. We are no longer slaves to the fear of God's judgment as orphans, children of wrath (Eph 2:3). We are accepted and loved in the same way and with the same love God has for his only unique Son, Jesus Christ (John 17:23). So God the Father thinks and feels the same way about you as he does his own unique Son Jesus. What he said of Jesus he says of you, ""this is my beloved Son with whom I am well pleased (Mat 3:17)"" because of what Jesus secured for you. This also means that you are as safe and secure in your status before God as Jesus's status before God. His love for you is not the result of you believing him; his love for you was before time began when he set his affections on you and chose to love you not because you were cute but because of the extravagant nature of his love. Not only that be he also destined us to be adopted, He predestined, giving us a destiny as his children (Eph 1:3-6). This is why every human being has a desire for greatness, for purpose, why we are looking for identity, and struggle with self esteem. But none of it will come by looking at yourself or within. Paul's praised is based upon his understanding God's sovereignty in adoption. This is the implication, to the extent that you understand God's sovereignty in your adoption is to the extent that you will respond in worship and thanks to God."
Romans 8:1-11,"('Holy Spirit', 'Spirit Of Life', 'Gods Justice')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," The Holy Spirit: Learn, Unlearn, Relearn Set Free By the Spirit Romans 8:1-11 David Taylor February 12, 2017 We are in a series called, The Holy Spirit: Learn, Unlearn, and Relearn. My desire is that we gain a better understanding of life in the Spirit and our need for the person and work of the Holy Spirit in our lives. So far we have seen that the Spirit is the source of all spiritual life in John 7; the Spirit gives us new birth in John 3; the Spirit applies the work of the Son in adopting us as children of God; and this week we look at the work the Spirit in making the decisive break with sin for us. The first seven chapters of Romans tell us why all humanity stands condemned before God chapter eight tells us followers of Christ are no longer condemned because of the Spirit in our lives. The first four verses what salvation brings us by the work of the Spirit. First we see that we are free of the penalty of sin, ""there is therefore no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus (1)."" The Bible describes all humanity as born under God's judgment because of our sinfulness and rebellion against him. Condemnation means we stand guilty and under God's judgement for violating God's law; the opposite of justification. If to be justified is to stand boldly before God because we are righteous in his sight, to be condemned is to cower in fear because we are unrighteous and worthy of death. The gospel promises that the penalty of sin, condemnation before God, is broken over those who are in Christ by faith. If you have put your faith in Christ, there is never any reason to experience fear or apprehension about your relationship with God or your eternal destiny (39). That does not mean you won't experience fear but that there is no reason why you should fear. No means never here. But this status is not universal but only for those who are in Christ by faith. You may think that God is love will not judge or condemn anyone but that is not consistent with how we view the world. A child disobeys a parent so they are disciplined. A student cheats on a test so gets a failing grade. Someone breaks the law and they pay a fine or are incarcerated depending upon their crime. Intuitively, we think people should face consequences for their wrongs. If they do not, we feel a sense of injustice because we are made in God's image and our sense of justice reflects God's justice. We are free of the penalty of sin because we have been set free from the power of sin over us. ""for the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death (2)."" The law of sin and death is that if you sin you die but the law of the Spirit is that though Christ is without sin, he died for you. The Spirit applies to us who are in Christ, the work of Christ on our behalf. Some think that if we do the right things, are really religious and faithful that we are ok with God. But Paul tells us here that God is the only one who can save us (3). God has done what the law could not do; the law could not and never will have the power to save anyone. Its purpose is to expose sin, to convict of sin, but it cannot free us from the sinfulness of our hearts which desires to rebel against rules. So God did what the law could not do, by sending his own son, showing us the cost of no condemnation. Christians are not condemned because God condemned his own Son on our behalf. The Son of God took on human flesh to take the condemnation that was rightfully yours."
Psalms 23:1-6,"('Memorial Service', ""Leo's Passion"")",United Methodist," There was a male nurse the day Leo came out of surgery, Leo he was not very alert at all, until the young good looking male nurse hugged Louise and Leo crossed those arms as if to say she's mine and you better not hug her I love her! And this may mean pain to your physical body. I laughed so hard that that 84 year old was ready to jump him. It was cute my wife said. 1.

Galatians 5:1-6,"('Humility', 'Spiritual Fruit', 'Freed To Love')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," The Holy Spirit: Learn, Unlearn, Relearn Freed to Love Galatians 5:1-6 David Taylor February 26, 2017 We are in the midst of our series, The Holy Spirit: Learn, Unlearn, and Relearn. My goal is for us to gain a better understanding of life in the Spirit and our need for the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives. So far we have seen that the Spirit is the source of all spiritual life in John 7; the Spirit gives us new birth in John 3; the Spirit adopts us as children of God in Romans 8:14-17; the Spirit making a definitive break with sin in Romans 8:1-11; the work of the Spirit in overcoming sin in Galatians 5:16-18; and today the work of the Spirit in love in Galatians 5:1-6. We have been looking at the work of the Spirit in us personally and now we are moving to the work of the Spirit through and among us corporately. Today I want to look at one specific fruit of the Spirit that we looked at briefly last week, love. Love is an anchor to the church and our relationships. Jesus tells us that loving others imitates his love (John 15:12-13) and displays to the world that we are his disciples (John 13:34-35) and the glue that holds his church together (Eph 4:16) and is a constant theme in the New Testament letters. In Galatians five Paul builds his argument on the fact that Christ has set us free and our need to stand firm in that freedom by not taking back on the yoke of slavery, obeying the law in an effort to be acceptable to God (5:1). If you do that, the work of Christ on the cross to pay for your sin is of no value to you and you must obey the whole law perfectly which puts you back under slavery (5:2-3), the condemning burden of never being good enough and you sever yourself from Christ and grace (5:4). Then he gives the reason for his statement. We wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. We are justified by faith now but in the future Christ will declare publicly that we are justified. We now wait in the hope of this by faith through the Spirit. The Spirit is the one empowering, energizing our faith. Notice faith in the future is what empowers us in the present. Faith is forward looking. Faith is turning away from my own effort, toward Christ and his work on my behalf to justify me. Why is faith so important? Why does God love to respond to faith? Faith highlights my inability and God's ability. Faith looks away from human effort, human will power and looks toward God's power and his ability. We see this in Romans 4. ""In hope he believed against hope, that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been told, ""So shall your offspring be."" He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb. No unbelief made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised (4:18-21)."" Abraham recognized his own inability and looked to God's ability to do what he could not, and this faith in God glorified God as the great promise keeper who would do what he could not. Faith glorifies God because it recognizes my inability and God's ability. But how did Abraham grow strong in faith? We are not told, but I think as God reminded him of his word of promise, his faith grew and he glorified God as the God of the impossible. His faith came by hearing the word of promise. This is confirmed in Galatians 3:1-5. ""O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified. Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith? Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh? Did you suffer so many things in vain--if indeed it was in vain? Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith."" Paul asks, ""did you receive the Spirit because of your own efforts (the flesh) or by faith?"" The obvious answer is by faith and faith comes with hearing. But hearing what? The gospel, the word of promise. If we attempt to be reconciled to God by our own efforts or stay reconciled by our own efforts, we become enslaved again, are cut off from the work of Christ on our behalf, fall away from grace. That is why Paul says that neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, what I do or don't to be accepted, but only faith working through love (5:6). The Christian life is not about my attempting to get in or stay in but is by faith, faith that comes with hearing. My part is to hear the word which brings faith and strengthens faith."
Galatians 5:16-18,"('Faith In Christ', 'Walk By The Spirit')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," The Holy Spirit: Learn, Unlearn, Relearn Winning the War Within Galatians 5:16-18 David Taylor February 19, 2017 We are in a series called, The Holy Spirit: Learn, Unlearn, and Relearn. My desire is that we gain a better understanding of life in the Spirit and our need for the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives. So far we have seen that the Spirit is the source of all spiritual life in John 7; the Spirit gives us new birth in John 3; the Spirit adopts us as children of God in Romans 8:14-17; the Spirit making a definitive break with sin our salvation in Romans 8:1-11; and this week we look at the work of the Spirit in overcoming the daily struggle with sin in Galatians 5:16-18. The passage starts out with the command to walk by the Spirit and you will not gratify the desire of the flesh (see also Rom 8:4). It is in the form of a command because walking in the Spirit is not automatic, competing desires. That is natural and should encourage us. You do not gratify the desire of the flesh by walking according to the Spirit. If we want victory over the desire of the flesh, then we need to understand what it means to walk in the Spirit; why it is important to walk in the Spirit; and how do we walk in the Spirit. So first, let's look at what it means to walk in the Spirit. There is an image here that helps us understand what walking in the Spirit means. It is the phrase, ""led by the Spirit (Rom 8:12-14)."" Walk shows my involvement in my struggle with sin and being led shows the Spirit's involvement in my struggle with sin. What does it mean to be led by the Spirit? In Romans 8 we see that to be led by the Spirit means to yield or submit to the Spirit in putting sin to death in your life. It means to follow the leadership of the Spirit who is guiding and empowering you in your fight against sin. This fight is to the death. It is like a locomotive engine of a train providing the power to pull the train and taking the rest of the rail cars along the track. The rail cars do not move in their own strength but in the strength of the locomotive. So being led by the Spirit is yielding to the Spirit's strength and leadership in our fight against sin. The result is walking in the Spirit or the fruit of the Spirit (5:22) which is the work of the Spirit in us. Fruit is the result of the plant providing life and substance to the branches that flower and produce fruit. If the branch is not connected to the plant it has no resources to produce fruit. Fruit is the Spirit's work in us. Jesus used similar language in John 15:4-5. Abiding in Christ bears much fruit in us, apart from him we can do nothing. It is by abiding in Christ the Spirit of Christ (Rom 8:9-10) in us bears fruit. The Spirit points us to Christ's work on our behalf to strengthen us. As we are in living union with Christ, looking to be satisfied in him who saved us, freed us, loves us, and is working for our good not matter how difficult our circumstances, we bear fruit, becoming like Christ. So we fight against sin on one side (led by Spirit) and bear fruit on other (walk by the Spirit)."
Genesis 2:4-3:24,"('Fall', 'Creation', 'Paradise', 'Redemption')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Scripture We are currently in a series of sermons on Genesis 1-11 that I am calling, ""In the Beginning."" I plan to preach only six sermons on these 11 chapters. It is just an overview of redemptive history. Last week I preached a sermon on Genesis 1:1-2:3 about God creating the heavens and the earth. Moses wrote the book of Genesis (as well as the rest of the Pentateuch) during the forty years that the people of Israel wandered in the wilderness after they had left Egypt on their way to the Promised Land. By this time, the people knew a great deal about suffering in their lives. The narrative we are going to look at today, Genesis 2:4-3:24, is an explanation of how the world came to be the way it was. Today, we are going to learn about Paradise lost in Genesis 2:4-3:24. I am not going to read the entire narrative, since we will be examining it in today's sermon. I encourage you to follow along in your Bible. Let's read just the opening verse, Genesis 2:4: 4 These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens. (Genesis 2:4-3:24) Introduction A May 2013 article in The New York Times notes that ""suicide rates among middle-aged Americans have risen sharply in the past decade."" Here are the stats behind this trend: "" From 1999 to 2010, the suicide rate among Americans ages 35 to 64 rose by nearly 30 percent. "" More Americans now die of suicide (38,364) than car accidents (33,687). That's 3,026 more people who die from suicide each year than in car crashes. "" The most pronounced increases were seen among men in their 50s, a group in which suicides jumped by nearly 50 percent. "" The suicide rate for middle-aged men was three times higher than for middle-aged women. Researchers claim that the reasons for suicide are often complex, but this article focused on two factors - the stress of the economic downturn and the widespread availability of prescription painkillers. But it also hinted that deeper issues, like failed expectations and a loss of hope, might be a root cause for the increase in suicides. Dr. Julie Phillips, a researcher from Rutgers University, says, ""The boomers had great expectations for what their life would look like, but... it hasn't turned out that way."" Dr. Phillips warns that future generations will be facing the same conditions that lead to this sense of despair. The people of God in the time of Moses had this same loss of hope and sense of despair. They had spent 400 years in Egypt, and had given up hope of ever reaching the Promised Land again. Then, God led them out of Egypt through his servant Moses. However, even as they wandered through the wilderness with all its struggles and hardships, the people must have questioned how the world came to be as it is. So, Moses wrote today's narrative to give God's people hope. Lesson The analysis of the Fall in Genesis 2:4-3:24 teaches us that God banishes sinners from Paradise with a view to restoring his perfect Paradise on earth."
Philippians 3:10-14,"('Life Mission', 'Personal Mission')",Presbyterian/Reformed," Have a Clear Mission YOLO Part 1 Philippians 3:10-14 Today we are starting a brand-new message series: YOLO (You only live once.) Some people use YOLO to inspire courage and bravery. Others use YOLO to justify doing something idiotic and embarrassing. It is true that we only live once. However, what does this imply? I heard some people using this philosophy to justify their reckless lifestyle or doing some idiotic behavior. But as Christians, how should we use our one and only life? Should we do whatever we want to do? Should we just relax and chill? The Bible is very clear on this. We only live once. Therefore, we must invest our one and only life meaningfully. We must use our lives to make some eternal differences. In order to do that, the first thing that we must do is this: We must live with a clear mission. But what is a mission? For Christians, a mission is a commission that God gave to each one of us. A mission is our fundamental purpose for our existence. A mission is the reason why God has created and called us. A mission is the reason why we live. And without knowing our mission, we cannot live our one and only life meaningfully. This is why in the passage that we read today, the Apostle Paul told us that we must realize these three truths regarding our mission. I. We must find our God-given mission (vv. 10-11). A pastor once preached a sermon from Philippians 3, and he told people that we must live to fulfill our God-given mission. After the worship, he talked with a person and asked him whether he is running to fulfill his mission in life. Then he said this: ""Since I do not know what my mission is, I cannot run toward it."" I visit churches and ask people, ""Do you believe that you have a mission from God?"" They all say, ""Amen!"" I ask another question, ""Do you know what your God-give mission is?"" Then everyone becomes very quiet. If we do not know what our mission in life is, it is impossible to fulfill that mission. This is why in order to live a life that fulfills our God-given mission, we must know what that mission is. Verses 10-11 say this. 10 I want to know Christ--yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, 11 and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead. Paul had a clear idea why he was living. Paul knew his mission. That was to know Jesus, so that he can be like Him. He wanted to know the power of His resurrection and participate in His suffering, so that eventually he can be resurrected and live eternally with Jesus in heaven. That was his ultimate goal in life. And this gave him a clear direction in life. But the problem is this: So many Christians do not know what their God-given mission is. And because they do not know what their God-given mission is, they cannot fulfill it. But how can we find our God-given mission? Is there a formula? I came up with this diagram to show how we can find our mission in life. In order to find our God-given mission, we must consider these three things: First, the Bible."
Acts 3:12-26,"(""Peter's Sermon"", 'A Warning To Israel', 'Peters Sermon', 'Prince Of Life', 'Holy One Of Israel')",Baptist," August 19, 2013 By: Tom Lowe Series: The Early Church Title: A Warning to Israel: Peter's Sermon (3.12-26) Acts 3.12-26 (KJV) 12 And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk? 13 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go. 14 But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you; 15 And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses. 16 And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. 17 And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers. 18 But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled. 19 Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; 20 And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: 21 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. 22 For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. 23 And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. 24 Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days. 25 Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. 26 Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities. Introduction In this passage we can observe the difference in the manner of working miracles. Our Lord always spoke like One having Almighty power, never hesitated to receive the greatest honor that was given to him on account of his Divine miracles. But the apostles referred all the glory to their Lord, and refused to receive any honor themselves, except as his undeserving instruments. This shows that Jesus was one with the Father, and co-equal with Him; while the apostles knew that they were weak, sinful men, and dependent for everything on Jesus, whose power effected the cure of the crippled man. Useful men must be very humble. Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy name, give glory. Every crown must be cast at the feet of Christ. The apostle showed the Jews the greatness and terribleness of their crime, but would not anger or drive them to despair. Assuredly, those who reject, refuse, or deny Christ, do it through ignorance; but this can in no case be an excuse."
Proverbs 3:5-6,"('Trust', 'Trust God')",Assembly Of God," Text: Proverbs 3:5-6 Title: Those whose paths God directs Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will direct your paths."" Proverbs 3:5-6 contain one of the greatest promises in the Bible: God promises to direct your paths or as other translations of verse 6 put it; God promises to make your paths straight or as it reads in the Message "" He will keep you on track."" So whichever translation you choose to use Proverbs 3:5-6 always amounts to a great promise. It really is a great promise for another reason too; because God promises to direct all your paths.Your education path; your career path; your family path, your ""paying the bills"" path, your retirement path,.. No matter which path you are on God promises to direct them all. Ps. 37:25 ""I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread."" However God's promise to direct our paths is a conditional promise. It is conditional on us doing some things in order to free God up to direct our paths. 1. Trust in the Lord with all your heart. 2. Lean not on your own understanding 3. Acknowledge Him in all your ways. So our 3 points for today are these: 1. God directs the paths of those who trust in Him with all their heart. It starts with trust! If we want God to direct our paths we have to first trust God with all our hearts. Old Hymn: Trust and Obey ""But we never can prove, the delights of his love until all on the altar we lay; for the favor he shows, and the joy he bestows, are for them who will trust and obey."" A great New Testament example of God directing the paths of those who trust in him with all their heart is found in John 14:1-3 ""Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me. In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you. I will come back to take you to be with me that you may be where I am."" If God has a place in heaven reserved for those who trust in him do you think he just might also have other things; like a career, a spouse, a family, also prepared for those who trust in him? If I am trusting in God for my salvation should I not trust in Him for everything else? God is looking at the heart. When he finds a heart that trusts in Him He directs that person in the paths he or she should go. So what does a heart that trusts in God look like? Mary the mother of Jesus had a heart that trusted Jesus A. A heart that trusts in God is a surrendered heart (Luke 1:v38) ""I am the Lord's servant."" May it be to me as you have said."" Mary surrendered her heart to the promises of God. When you got married to your spouse you surrendered your heart to the vows your spouse made. You trusted your spouse to keep the vows they made to you. You trust God when you surrender all your heart to him and too his promises Old Hymn: I surrender All to Jesus I surrender, Lord I give myself to thee. Fill me with thy love and power, let thy blessing fall on me."
2 Samuel 6:6-10,"('God', 'Character', 'Loving God', 'Righteous Anger', 'Angry God')",Assembly Of God," Angry or Loving? God Behaving Badly Series WHAG (June 7th, 2015) Scripture- 2 Sam 6 Opening Questions- 1. Think of negative thoughts or opinions you have about God 2. In our bible reading- Old Testament passages do you avoid because they paint a picture of God that doesn't seem to match with Jesus or your view of HIM? 3. For a couple of years, I read the bible in chronological order- meaning I'd spend a good 8 months or so reading only the Old Testament. 4. If you read a lot of Old Testament you can come to the opinion that God is very crabby, volatile, and ready to lash out at any little thing. You live in fear instead of faith, until you really study the context of when God does show judgment and wrath. 5. One of the worlds most renowned atheists, Professor Richard Dawkins said in his book ""The God Delusion"" (QUOTE) The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully. (end quote) And really, this isn't just his view- it's the view of the unsaved world about God 6. We are going to answer these questions and the accusations of Professor Dawkins this morning by exploring one of the instances in scripture where God seemingly acted in irrational anger with a violent result 2 Sam 6:1-10 David again brought together out of Israel chosen men, thirty thousand in all. 2 He and all his men set out from Baalah of Judah a to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name, b the name of the Lord Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim that are on the ark. 3 They set the ark of God on a new cart and brought it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, were guiding the new cart 4 with the ark of God on it, c and Ahio was walking in front of it. 5 David and the whole house of Israel were celebrating with all their might before the Lord, with songs d and with harps, lyres, tambourines, sistrums and cymbals. 6 When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of God, because the oxen stumbled. 7 The Lord's anger burned against Uzzah because of his irreverent act; therefore God struck him down and he died there beside the ark of God. 8 Then David was angry because the Lord's wrath had broken out against Uzzah, and to this day that place is called Perez Uzzah. e 9 David was afraid of the Lord that day and said, ""How can the ark of the Lord ever come to me?"" Prayer Big idea- How do we reconcile the God that loved us so much that He gave His one and only Son with a God who strikes a person dead for doing what appears to be a good deed. I. Why was God angry, Why did He do such a sudden and seemingly irrational and angry act? A. First- they lost the ark in the first place 1. Battle with Philistines. (1 Sam 4)"
Romans 5:1-11,"('Suffering', 'God Is Good', 'Enduring Suffering', 'God In Your Pain', 'The Holy Spirit')",*other,omans 5:1-11 (cf. 3-5); John 4:5-42; Exodus 17:1," Theme: Suffering Title: God and Human Suffering Suffering is a Human Reality and there are some important facts to always remember - 1. Our God is a Good God 2. Our God shares in our Suffering 3. Suffering can lead us to experience greater spiritual transformation in our lives INTRO: Grace and peace from God our Father and from His Son Jesus Christ who came to take away the sin of the world! All of our passages this morning have a central theme: that of suffering. We see it first in our story concerning the Children of Israel in the Wilderness. They have been rescued from Egypt and are on their way to the Promise Land. Our LORD is supply their bread (manna) along the way but now they have come to a point where they cannot find water. We all know that food is of little value if one cannot find water. You can go for weeks without food but only a few days without water. For the elderly, young children and infants that time is even less. Here God's people are in the Sinai Peninsula near the area of Rephidim and are grumbling because they are suffering. Before we take them to task over their lack of faith or grumbling we must take a moment and walk in their shoes. By now they have been walking/traveling for weeks and have traveled well over 250 miles. They are tired, sore and grumpy. Having grown up around the level plains of the Nile they were not physically or emotionally ready for all of this wilderness/mountain traveling . Nor did they anticipate that their trip would include periods of times of testing, trials and suffering. And so when they begin to suffer a little they complain. Sounds like us at times doesn't it? Our extended passage in the Gospel of John centers around a woman who bore the scars of some deep suffering. No one who loses five husbands has escaped the pain and tragedy of deep suffering. Whether she lost those husbands through sickness, death or divorce we can be assured that her heart had been broken many times. Her life had been in constant turmoil. The picture John paints for us is one of a woman who was now suffering from the pain of a man who didn't love her enough to marry her but had chosen only to have her as his partner. While we may not have approved of her life at this time we must not judge her to harshly. After all, in her day what were her options? Very few widows at that time could take care of themselves or their children. More than likely she was destitute and had no other choice but to connect with this man. All we truly know is that when she meet Jesus she was suffering from a great deal of pain - emotionally, socially, physically, mentally and spiritually. Our Romans passage speaks to us about the reality of pain and suffering in this life. The Apostle Paul begins our passage first by sharing with us some very great news: +In verse one, he shares with us the Good News that we can be at peace with God. Paul shares with us that in Christ we can experience the reconciliation of all reconciliations. We can know that our sins have been forgiven and we can experience a deep and loving relationship with God that had been promised since the beginnings of time."
1 Corinthians 6:1-11,"('Decision', 'Boldness', 'Daring', 'Qualified')",Baptist," QUALIFIED To DECIDE-I--1Corinthians 6:1-11 OR Qualified To Rectify Attention: Computer Dating: A hopeful suitor logged onto match.com , the online dating service & registered his qualifications & his desires. He was looking for a young lady with four minimal qualities--she should be who was petite, enjoyed water sports, enjoyed company, & favored formal attire. The young man excitedly entered all his information onto the website. The computerized matching system took a good deal of time, but eventually set him up with a perfect match. It sent him to the south pole, which he thought was rather odd because not many people live in Antarctica. You see it had paired him with a penguin! Decisions made CAN disqualify our authority! Paul rebuked the Corinthian Christians because they sought out & trusted secular sources to rectify personal grievances among themselves. 'Grievance'--'A real or imagined wrong or other cause for complaint or protest, especially unfair treatment.' 'Rectify'--'To put(something) right; To correct.' The Church & Christians are uniquely fitted for properly rectifying personal grievances among themselves. How/When are Christians fit for rectifying personal grievances? 6 confirmations that Christians are fitted to properly rectify personal grievances. 1--Christians are qualified to rectify grievances thru Their... DARING/Boldness(:1) Explanation:(:1)Holiness :1--""Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unrighteous, & not before the saints?"" There is a temptation, among Christians, to take a ""another""(Christian brother or sister) to court. Why?--Christians disagree with one another. And those with money may 'have a lawyer' whom they use for other business matters. Thus it would be an easy jump for new Christians to think it practical to use their lawyer for matters within the church without considering ramifications. This temptation arises when we have a ""matter""/case/charge/accusation against him/her. This case can be legally brought to law. But in doing so, such an official, legally binding law will be arrived at thru parameters determined by the ""unrighteous."" Thereby, Christians should NEVER consider ""unrighteous"" courts or unrighteous reasonings as a course of action in settling a ""matter"" against another Christian. Why exactly?...see :2-4! Thus all ""matters"" between Christian brothers & sisters have a spiritual element which must not be denied, & which informs any actions which may be entered either for or ""against one another."" Christians should instead take their cases before the saints--their brothers & sisters in Christ... But then doing so, requires the baring of one's soul before those to whom they do not wish to have knowledge of their real prejudices. Gal. 6:1-7--""Brethren, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, considering yourself lest you also be tempted. Bear one another's burdens, & so fulfill the law of Christ. For if anyone thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself. But let each one examine his own work, & then he will have rejoicing in himself alone, & not in another. For each one shall bear his own load. Let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches. Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap."""

By Wade Martin Hughes, Sr. Kyfingers@aol.com Ever heard it said: IF THIS IS WRONG, I DO NOT WANT TO BE RIGTH? THERE ARE MANY GREAT QUESTIONS IN THE BIBLE... ONE WAS ASKED BY A POLITICAL LEADER THAT IS GOOD TO PONDER... John 18:38 Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all. I read where a man got a light and went out to search for truth? Can we find a good valid definition for TRUTH? Who defines truth? WHAT IS THE NATURE OF TRUTH? Can we define truth as facts? Reality? Who's facts? Who's reality? Do we define truth by discussing falsehoods and lies?

The King had a special servant that always traveled with him. The King loved being around this servant as he was always upbeat and positive. The man always said kind things and was quick to edify and encourage others. The King would wake up in the morning and his servant would run to him and say: ""THIS IS A GOOD DAY. WE ARE ALIVE. THIS IS GOOD, IT IS REALLY GOOD!"" The King ate breakfast and the servant said: "" THIS IS GOOD, IT IS REALLY GOOD!"" When the King came out in his royal clothes: His servant said: ""YOU LOOK SO GOOD TODAY! THIS IS GOOD, IT IS REALLY GOOD"" When people came to the King and complained and the King would listen. The servant would visit with the King and tell him how blessed they were and nothing was as bad as it first appeared. Then the servant would say: "" THIS IS GOOD, IT IS REALLY GOOD!"" The King loved hunting with his bow an arrow. His little servant was there by his side. The King would have great success, and his servant would say: "" THIS IS GOOD, IT IS REALLY GOOD!"" At night as the servant prepared the King for his rest, the servant would always say:"
Mark 1:29-39,"('Gospel', 'Power', 'Prayer', 'Deliverance')",Baptist," Glimpses of Grace Mark 1: 29-39 The rapid pace of events continues as we progress through Mark's Gospel. Jesus and the disciples have left the synagogue and immediately entered the house of Simon Peter and Andrew, his brother. This would not be a leisurely afternoon. Upon arriving Jesus begins attending to present needs within the home. Our text today moves from one event to another, in succession. As we look at these events, again we find the love, compassion, and commitment of Jesus for the needs of others, as well as His devotion to His Father. I would like to examine these moments individually as we consider: Glimpses of Grace. I. A Private Moment (29-31) - These verses describe a private moment within the house of Simon Peter. I am thankful for those private moments with our Lord. Consider: A. The Timing (29) - And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. Bear in mind they have just left the synagogue, and are likely going to share a meal together following the service. Jesus had spoken with authority and cast out an unclean spirit. They had experienced a great spiritual moment, and yet the demands of life and ministry continued. There was no time to rest from the work. B. The Trouble (30) - But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her. This doesn't appear to be a life-threatening illness, but it was certainly an inconvenience. She had probably intended to prepare a meal for them, but was sick and unable to carry out her duties. (The magnitude of this problem didn't compare to the needs within the synagogue, but it was a problem that had to be addressed. Jesus did not hesitate; He wasn't reluctant to address the smaller, seemingly insignificant problems. He showed compassion for her need as well.) C. The Touch (31) - And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them. It is possible that the fever would have run its course in a few hours, but Jesus did not neglect her need. He had power over the fever within her body and provided the healing she desired. His touch brought immediate healing and she rose and ministered to them. (There is no problem we face that Jesus can't handle. Whether they appear big or small, the Lord is concerned with our need and able to provide for us!) II. A Public Moment (32-34) - Mark records that Jesus went from a private moment, within the home in the afternoon, to a public moment later that evening. Consider: A. The Momentum (32) - And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils. Following the events at the synagogue that morning, the fame of Jesus began to spread throughout the region of Galilee. Word had spread through Capernaum that Jesus had power to heal and cast out unclean spirits. The people began to recognize there was something special about this man, and they came to find Him. (I am thankful for the moment I heard of the power of Jesus and responded by faith. I had witnessed His power in the lives of others and eventually saw my need for His gracious touch!)"

TEXT 11 The angel of the Lord came and sat down under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to keep it from the Midianites. 12 When the angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon, he said, ""The Lord is with you, mighty warrior."" 13 ""Pardon me, my lord,"" Gideon replied, ""but if the Lord is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our ancestors told us about when they said, 'Did not the Lord bring us up out of Egypt?' But now the Lord has abandoned us and given us into the hand of Midian."" 14 The Lord turned to him and said, ""Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian's hand. Am I not sending you?"" 15 ""Pardon me, my lord,"" Gideon replied, ""but how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family."" 16 The Lord answered, ""I will be with you, and you will strike down all the Midianites, leaving none alive."" 17 Gideon replied, ""If now I have found favor in your eyes, give me a sign that it is really you talking to me. 18 Please do not go away until I come back and bring my offering and set it before you."" And the Lord said, ""I will wait until you return."" 19 Gideon went inside, prepared a young goat, and from an ephah of flour he made bread without yeast. Putting the meat in a basket and its broth in a pot, he brought them out and offered them to him under the oak. 20 The angel of God said to him, ""Take the meat and the unleavened bread, place them on this rock, and pour out the broth."" And Gideon did so. 21 Then the angel of the Lord touched the meat and the unleavened bread with the tip of the staff that was in his hand. Fire flared from the rock, consuming the meat and the bread. And the angel of the Lord disappeared. 22 When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the Lord, he exclaimed, ""Alas, Sovereign Lord! I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face!"" 23 But the Lord said to him, ""Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die."" 24 So Gideon built an altar to the Lord there and called it The Lord Is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. C. THESIS 1.

Acts 4:1-22,"('Caiaphas', 'Sadducees', 'Filled With Holy Ghost', 'Annas The High Priest')",Baptist," October 7, 2013 By: Tom Lowe Series: The Early Church Lesson II.C.3.a: The Animosity of the Religious Leaders (4.1-22) Acts 4.1-22 (KJV) 1 And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them, 2 Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead. 3 And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide. 4 Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand. 5 And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes, 6 And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem. 7 And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this? 8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel, 9 If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole; 10 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. 11 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. 12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. 13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. 14 And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it. 15 But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, 16 Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it. 17 But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name. 18 And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. 19 But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. 20 For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard. 21 So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done. 22 For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed. Introduction In this chapter we have the first opposition from the Jewish leaders, which leads to relentless and awful persecution. One of the main purposes of Acts is to show that Jews who rejected and crucified Jesus continued their rebellion against God by rejecting the gospel of the resurrected and ascended Jesus proclaimed by the apostles. This chapter describes the beginning of this opposition, which culminated with the plots of the Jews to kill Paul on his last visit to Jerusalem: ""And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy. And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul. Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him"" (Acts 23.12-15)."
1 Corinthians 4:18-20,"('Gospel', 'Power', 'Kingdom Of God')",Foursquare," The Kingdom of God ""Kingdom Life is Power"" 1 Corinthians 4:18-20 Tonight we'll be looking at another aspect of the Kingdom of God that really isn't understood that well. Further, these verses could have easily been written to the church today. Corinth was a Greek city and a commercial seaport. And like most Greek cities they had their academies, their places of higher learning where philosophy was discussed as to the meaning of life. And there in Corinth the Apostle Paul established a church. But due to a plethora of problems Paul had to write them several times to deal with them. Some of those problems had to do with how they viewed him. They criticized his appearance and speech. While his writings were well received, apparently he didn't look the part and his speech wasn't eloquent. ""For some say, 'His letters are weighty and forceful, but in person he is unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing.'"" (2 Corinthians 10:10 NIV) The Greek culture was accustomed to leaders who were great physical specimens, such as seen in the Olympic games and in their art, and who were great orators, those who studied the art of speech and who could eloquently present an argument. But this wasn't Paul. By the time he got to Corinth his eyesight was bad, his body was broken due to torture and abuse. He told them that he had been whipped five times, beaten three times, stoned and left for dead, and was often imprisoned along with a litany of other things he had to endure. (2 Corinthians 11:22-28) In his first letter Paul says, ""To the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and we are poorly clothed, and beaten, and homeless. And we labor, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure; being defamed, we entreat. We have been made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things until now."" (1 Corinthians 4:11-13 NKJV) As far as his speech, he tried eloquent, but it got him nowhere when he was in Athens. And so he spoke in a plain and blunt manner, not about the philosophies or meaning of life; instead he preached one thing and one thing only, and that is, Jesus Christ and Him crucified. (1 Corinthians 2:2) But his writings were another matter, they were forceful and to the point, which is where we find ourselves in tonight's passage as Paul makes it clear that he would come once again to Corinth and put things right, and the way he would know was in their words, that is, did their words contain the power of God, or are they merely talking be something their not. ""Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you. But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power. For the kingdom of God is not in word but in power."" (1 Corinthians 4:18-20 NKJV) Paul is saying that the Kingdom of God isn't in what we say, that is in word, but it is where the power of God is being manifested. Today we're living in an age that's fond of discussing Christianity. Yet in all the talking, in all the writing, in all the debating and discussions, where is the power of God?"
2 Corinthians 5:20-6:2,"('Reconciliation', 'Synergy', 'Acceptable Time')",Evangelical/Non-Denominational," BE YE RECONCILED TO GOD 2 Corinthians 5:20-21; 2 Corinthians 6:1-2 As an ambassador for Christ, Paul was pleading with the Corinthians - on behalf of Christ - that they go on being reconciled to God (2 Corinthians 5:20). We may feel that this is unnecessary: if we are 'called out ones' (church), and 'set apart ones' (saints) (cf. 2 Corinthians 1:1) - then are we not already reconciled with God? Such a boast betrays a failure to recognise that, along with the once-and-forever experience of a true conversion to God-in-Christ, there continues to be the on-going necessity of being sanctified. Have we not, at times, failed God, and found it incumbent upon ourselves to repent, and to 'recommit' ourselves to God? Paul goes so far as to warn the Corinthians of the possibility that they might have ""received the grace of God in vain"" (2 Corinthians 6:1). Without being too morbid or introspective, it is necessary from time to time to give ourselves a spiritual health-check. Even in all the busyness of the Christian life and walk, are we really fully-committed to the relationship at the heart of our lives: being reconciled to God? Or does our Christian life need a shot-in-the-arm to engender a new enthusiasm? I am not advocating a new experience, but rather a getting-back-to-the-basics of our Christian life. Time to read, and to reflect; to meditate, and to pray; and to stop, and to listen to God. We may not be able to 'go on retreat', but it is surely to our advantage to 'make time' for God - who has, after all, done so much for us. What has he done? Well, ""God caused Christ, who knew no sin, to become sin for us; in order that in Christ we might become the righteousness of God"" (2 Corinthians 5:21). If we are going-on being-reconciled, then it stands to reason that we must be going-on-being-made-righteous. Quick pulse check: how does that show in my life? In his earlier letter, Paul had spoken of himself and others as 'God's fellow-workers' (1 Corinthians 3:9). The word for ""fellow-workers"" gives us our English word, 'synergy', which speaks of a combined effort, a co-operation with God if you will. It is not that God lacks anything: He could create, train and grow Christians all on His own. But what a privilege for ministers to be involved in the formation of His creation, the nurturing of His 'babes-in-Christ' (if they will allow themselves to be nurtured and 'trained up' in the ways of the Lord). In this later letter, Paul again employs the 'synergy' word (2 Corinthians 6:1), indicating that he and others are workers-together, presumably with God, and perhaps even with the Corinthians (and ourselves?) if they (we?) will just get on board with the programme? Paul quotes Isaiah 49:8 where, in an accepted time, a season of grace, a day of salvation, Jesus is given as a covenant to the people of Israel; and faithful preachers are sent from Israel to restore the earth, so that the meek may inherit it. Whatever God may have done in our past, the word remains: ""behold, NOW is the accepted time; behold, NOW is the day of salvation"" (2 Corinthians 6:2)."
Psalms 23:4,"('Death', 'Shadow Of Death', 'Valleys', 'Valley Of The Shadow Of Death')",Foursquare," Navigating Life's Dark Valleys Psalm 23:4 Last week we looked at how to handle the stress in our ongoing series entitled, ""Spiritual First Aid."" In that message I alluded to the Shepherd's Psalm, Psalm 23, a couple of time, because within the Psalm God deals with many of life's stressors. In what might be considered as the most recognizable verses of Psalm 23, King David deals with the stress of the potential loss of life. And while we've looked at this verse and the valleys of life, I thought it might be good to look at this verse once again, given the various losses many of us have experienced lately. And I'm not talking about the loss of life along, but also the loss of finances, relationships, jobs, and even health. In Psalm 23:4 King David said, ""Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me."" (Psalm 23:4 NKJV) In Israel there's actually a valley called ""The Shadow of Death."" I'm told it's a steep, dark, and narrow canyon that the sun only reaches when it's directly overhead. David may very well have led his sheep up this valley. The Bible often talks about valleys as tough times. "" Joshua talks about a Valley of Calamity. (Joshua 7:26) "" Psalm 84:6 uses the imagery of people passing through the Valley of Baca, or weeping, and "" Hosea talks about the Valley of Achor, or the Valley of Trouble. (Hosea 2:15) Other valleys mentioned in the Bible are where battles have been fought and victories won. The Valley of Elah is one such valley. This is where young David won a great victory for Israel over the Philistines by defeating the giant Goliath. (1 Samuel 17:19) Now if you were on God's side of this valley, this valley is one of victory. But if you were on Goliath's side, then you went down in flames. There is also the Valley of Shittim, which is part of the larger Jordan Valley. It was in this valley that the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah resided and that God brought judgment against because of their sins. Once this valley was green and fertile, but now it's nothing but desolation. In fact, the sea that is located in that valley is dead. That's why it's known as the ""Dead Sea."" It's the same desolation we see whenever the Valley of Hinnon is mentioned. This valley lies outside of Jerusalem. It was in this valley that Israel greatly sinned by sacrificing their children to the god Molech. As a consequence the Lord calls it a place of slaughter and as a place of ashes and bodies. (Jeremiah 7:31; 31:40) During the days of Jesus the Valley of Hinnon was the city's garbage dump where fires continually burned, and was synonymous with hell, a place of decay and burning. Today valleys are not well thought of. We talk of being in despair as being in a valley. When we're not doing well we say we're in a valley. But our valleys don't have to be places of despair. To rightly handle our times in these valleys we need to understand some aspects or facts about the valleys we encounter in life."
Zechariah 4:1-10,"('Temple', 'The Temple Of God', 'The Foundation Of The Temple')",Assembly Of God," THE DAY OF SMALL THINGS I want to bring to each of us a word of encouragement tonight. I must confess to you of my disappointment during those times that I have struggled with my health. I thought I could just pray and believe for my healing. I did what was ""spiritual."" My faith was not destroyed, but I needed a word of encouragement for those times. You know what I am talking about when you pray and believe, but you look and see very little change. Text: Zechariah 4:1 thru 10(a) In our text the children of Israel are having to trust the Lord for the reconstruction of the Temple. Solomon's Temple has been destroyed, and the Lord has commissioned for the new one to be built. All the people have is a promise from an angel, and the foundation of the Temple. It was a big undertaking and Israelites needed to be encouraged. Everyone remembers the glory of Solomon's Temple, but all they have (here in our text) is the foundation. Many are grumbling and murmuring about the little they have. And the angel of the Lord asks them the same question that we too need to ask ourselves, ""Who despises the day of small things?"" The foundation was only a small beginning for what would become a greater temple than Solomon's. Perhaps they looked around and at each other and said, What you see is what you get (for now). This is all we have, but this is all we need to have. God is faithful. God is good. But there are times (in following and trusting God) that we will have to dare to believe that He is going to accomplish His will for our lives. We are not reconstructing the Temple, but we have to dare to believe that - "" God is going to save that certain someone and bring them back into the fold. "" God is going to use you to make the difference in the lives of the people you know. We cannot despise small beginnings in what God has called us to do. We may have to make a stand for what we believe in. Sometimes, it is tempting to look down and only see a foundation of stone and mortar and realize that is all you have for all of your hard work and faithfulness. God knows that it is very critical that we watch over our SMALL THINGS, and make sure we remain faithful. The devil wants you to think you don't have much and never will have much to show for your faithfulness. Moses was just a small baby when his mother placed him into the basket made of reeds. His chances for survival were slim. The world desperately needed Moses to live past being a baby so he could - "" Deliver the children of Israel from the bondage of Pharoah. "" Deliver the commandments and the laws of God to a world lost in sin. But let's face it. Perhaps the most dangerous place in the world for a baby was the Nile River. The river was full of crocodiles, snakes & piranhas. When we consider this story of this small baby, this SMALL THING sent from God, we also see the fact that it didn't matter what the circumstance were. The plan of God for this SMALL THING was too overwhelming for anything to ever destroy little Moses. The fact is Moses was as safe in the Nile River as He would ever be his whole life."
Acts 1:8,"('New Year', 'The New Year', 'The Spirit Filled Church')",Assembly Of God," THE SPIRIT FILLED CHURCH IN 2016 Sville - 01.03.16 I am curious to know what your personal thoughts are for our church, NEW LIFE in the year of 2015. What will you remember about last year? What did God accomplish in your personal life last year? What about your spiritual life? ""Let me tell you what God did for me last year..."" Personally - I am pleased overall with what God did. I have no regrets with our response and our commitment to the Spirit of God in 2015. As many of you know, we had to spend most of the year reacting to the many changes that we all went through. It wasn't always easy and we still have more changes that will come our way this year... Lord willing ... QUESTIONS: ? What should we expect for this New Year? ? I am convinced that our church family has a lot of potential, but what should we do differently this year? ? Or do we keep doing what worked for us in 2015? Regardless of what we might plan, God has plans for us that are probably bigger than we realize... Here is what I know - I DO NOT WANT TO MISS WHAT GOD WANTS FROM ME! OR YOU! There is one thing that is absolutely necessary (In order for us) to be everything God wants ... We so desperately need the Power of the Spirit of God in 2016. We are not (necessarily) a wealthy crowd. We don't have a lot of resources. We are all very ordinary people... From what I have read and studied, we are a lot like the first Christian church in the Book of Acts. Those folks were faced with a new beginning into the age of the New Testament. The Power of the Spirit of God was crucial for that church (2000 years ago) for them to become what all they had to be. Jesus said it all in one single verse: ACTS 1:8 But YOU will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon YOU, and YOU will be My witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the Earth."" What Jesus said to that early New Testament Church may seem to us beyond our abilities. Here we are planning to be our very best in the next Sunday morning Worship Service, or the next Bible teaching on the next Wednesday night. It is very important what we do from week to week. And yet that first church in Jerusalem was planning mission trips all over the world. The New Testament people would walk everywhere they would go. Try not to let all of that overwhelm you or make you feel any less than the believers of that time. Don't miss the point here... What Christ did was send the person of the Holy Spirit to those weary saints of long ago and (furthermore) Jesus wants to do the same for you and me. We may not carry the Gospel to Jerusalem, Judea or Samaria. The fact is many world renowned scholars and prophets (of our day) say the Great Commission Christ sent us to do may be near completion. Consider this: to carry the Gospel of Jesus Christ into each of the darkest four corners of the world is easier now than ever before. We could be down to the final hours, or days, or weeks before the return of Jesus Christ. The Gospel of Christ can easily get on a jet plane, or be emailed most anywhere in the world."
Mark 8:1-10,"('Stewardship', 'Fish And Loaves', 'Miracles General', 'Trust And Obey')",Lutheran," As diligent as the disciples were, they seem to always find themselves dealing with mathematical impossibilities with Jesus. This group of fishermen, tax collectors, reformed zealots, and farmers did know basic math; but they didn't quite know Jesus. Mark, the evangelist, reports to us an occasion whereby Jesus had to repeat a lesson on divine mathematics so that his team would know the power of faith over the lack of their possessions. And we still need those lessons repeated to us today in our society whereby we have seen the consequences of poor math calculations. Our minds are still pondering over how having the most popular votes doesn't outweigh the electoral college. Or, how the number of attendees at a Presidential inauguration is more important than the number of protesters at marching for Black Lives Matter, Women Rights, LGBT Rights, and Immigration Rights. Whether it is a matter of counting or being counted, it seems that we also can use a lesson in divine mathematics. So that lesson begins in our text where we find Jesus and disciples somewhere in a desolated region of the Decapolis and the crowds have again gathered. Jesus has been teaching, healing, and casting out demons and this crowd has remained with him. Similar to when Jesus fed the five thousand along the sea of Galilee, Jesus takes compassion upon these persons and desires to feed them as well. And, ironically we hear almost the same set of questions between Jesus and the disciples repeated. The disciples: ""How can one feed these people with bread here in the desert?"" Jesus' response: How many loaves do you have? And if I were to add a question to this Socratic dialogue between Jesus and the disciples it would probably be this: why does it matter to Jesus how much the disciples had? Why on this particular occasion, rather than ask what do you have, he asks how much do you have? Did the numbers really matter? The numbers didn't matter when he cast out a legion of demons from a man who lived in a graveyard. The numbers did not matter when the woman suffering from an issue of blood for twelve years pressed her way through a crowd to touch the hem of Jesus' garment and was healed. Nor did they seem to matter when Jesus took that boy's five loaves and two fish and fed five thousand people. So why do they matter now? Is God limited by our numbers? Is God confined to the budget of our tithes, the numbers sitting in the pews, or those we have listed on the church rolls? I would surmise that for the divine one the numbers do not matter but what you choose to do with them does. We serve a God that respond to our faith in action. As we take action in faith, God is faithful to respond in action. Look at the text. Jesus responds the hunger of the crowd because they stayed with him for three days. The Greek word used to describe that staying comes from pros-me'-no, meaning to continue with and to hold fast to the grace of God received. For God's divine mathematics to occur in our lives we have to stay the course. No matter how difficult it may get, stay. Even if we face dark days similar to those as when Jesus was shut up in a tomb we are to stay. Because just like he got up, so too we when we hold fast and stay."
Exodus 12:1-3,"('Redemption', 'Blood Of Christ')",Assembly Of God," REDEEMED BY THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB Intro: One of the most enjoyable things I know about being a part of NEW LIFE CHURCH is not having to live by a bunch of church rules and regulations. Church life can be simple or it can become complicated. After pastoring complicated churches, I have decided that I am too simple to let things become complicated. I firmly believe in living our lives (here at NEW LIFE) by what the Bible tells us in Romans 12:1. That is - we ""present our bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is our reasonable service."" Ask yourself, ""What does that mean (to me)?"" To force you to live holy and acceptable won't work. The Holy Word of God has a lot more influence on how you live your life for Jesus... Than I will ever have ... If we follow and live by that passage (Rom 12:1), none of us will have to be told what is acceptable (or, not acceptable) for my life. Here at NEW LIFE, We have the Good Life, the NEW LIFE, where we sense what the Holy Spirit is telling us, and what the Bible instructs us. This is illustrated for us with the Nation of Israel in Exodus 12. There we will find the nation of Israel living under the oppressive bondage of the Pharoahs of Egypt. They were being told by Pharoah what they could and couldn't do. God had better plans for the Nation of Israel than to be told by Pharoah how to live their lives. The Lord God Jehovah wanted to set His people free. TEXT: Exodus 12:1-3;5 PRAYER: In our text, the Nation of Israel were living in the last days before God would set them free and deliver them out of the hands of Pharoah. Likewise, WE are living in the ""last days"".. We know this is true for two important reasons: 1. Fulfillment of biblical prophesies 2. Recent world wide events (In a moment, We will look closely at what the Bible is instructing us.) But first.... I amazed by a recent world event. I'm talking about what has been reported from all over the world. There have been reports of eerie noises and sounds of explosions that are waking people in middle of the night. According to these reports, millions of people have become terrified. Credible stories are coming in from all over the world and with no explanation of what these sounds are or where they are coming from. Many of these reports are happening on the same day and some within the same hour. Frightened people have been seen coming out of their homes and into the streets to see what is going on. Oddly enough, no one can find where these noises are coming from. The most common reports are these noises are coming down out of the sky. I must admit that I was skeptical at first. I prayed and remembered that Romans 8:22 reports that: ""...the whole creation groans and labors with birth pangs..."" And that, ""we ourselves groan within ourselves ..."" And that, ""the Spirit makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered..."" Some of the people who have witnessed these sounds claim that these are angels in heaven ...??? Personally, I don't know about all of this, but if I were not living for God, I would repent and surrender myself to the God of Whom I do know about.. AMEN?"
Matthew 5:38-48,"('Children Of God', 'Inclusiveness', 'Love All', 'Judge Not')",Lutheran," ""Careful the things you say, Children will listen. Careful the things you do, Children will see And learn, Children may not obey But children will listen. Children will look to you For which way to turn To learn what to be Careful before you say ""Listen to me."" Children will listen"" When Stephen Sondheim penned those words in his musical, Into the Woods, he was attempting to define the framework of our learning- our parents, teachers, mentors, and other socio-economical structures whereby children are apt to listen. Even though they may not always do what we say they do listen. We did. There were those things, consciously and unconsciously that our parents, and environments communicated to us about people, places and things. And those learnings shaped our points of references that we use to make quick decisions about people and whether they are friend or foe. We called those our unconscious biases and some were based on fact but others were just based on hearsay. They were subtle but effective and the problem is that a great deal of the hearsay has been interpreted as actual facts. Think about it, you may have heard it said often of football athletes that they may be just dumb jocks or how blonds may have more fun but they are not the most intelligent people in the world thus- dumb blonds. Or, you may have heard it said that girls are not as proficient in math as boys. Or, men are just better leaders and all young women want to get marry and have babies someday. Or you heard it said all black men are all good athletes and black women are just ""angry."" Or you heard it said that the Irish tend to be over drinkers while the Italians are either, loud, connected with the mob, and talk with their hands. Those are some of the things that we've heard people say and the mass media exploit. And for some of us, we have used those sayings as our points of references when we meet new people or find ourselves in unfamiliar situations. And that's where we tend to walk on the thin ice of stereotypes, racism and sexism: basing our perceptions of what we have heard others say. Jesus deals with the hearsay of his day. And although some of it was based on fact, others were based on hearsay of what it meant to be children of God. He explains to all of us that being true children of God extended beyond just simply following the prescribed ""thou shall not"" law Moses but practicing its intent which is loving God with all our heart mind and soul and loving our neighbors and we love ourselves. Being God's children was not just the outward expression of obedience but an inward expression of God's grace and mercy in our lives. To be God's children one had to do more than just keep the rules but you had to have compassion for those who may mistreat you, misuse you, and abuse you. It was more than just keeping a list of rules. Just because you haven't killed someone, doesn't mean that you did not want to. Just because you haven't stolen doesn't mean that you did not covet the things of your neighbors. Just because you haven't divorce your spouse doesn't mean that you are in a happy healthy relationship. Sin was sin and the only prescriptive medicine was to address the conditions of the human heart. It was imperfect and Jesus wanted his followers to be perfect. Otherwise, they would be no better than anyone else. Unless they strived for perfection then they would be like students were only barely getting a passing grade but not excelling in the knowledge he was imparting. If you were to call yourself a child of God, then you would have to be perfect. Anything less did not make the grade. Come on now. Think about it. No one would want a doctor who just got C and D's and barely passing the medical boards operating on them. No one would want a lawyer who just went through Law school just receiving C's and barely passing the law exam handling their legal case. And yet, we have individuals going through God's kingdom calling themselves Christians and they are barely getting a passing grade. No wonder the world has a perverted view of Christianity and God's church. No wonder millennials and generation Xers are falling away because those who have been practicing this thing call Christianity have flunking one of its major courses. Jesus tells us that we have to be better and do better. 48Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect."
Acts 8:1,"('Evangelism', 'Mission')",Assembly Of God," SAVING SOULS IN SAMARIA Philip was a deacon (Acts 6:1-7) and he was an evangelist (Acts 8:1-40) ?- he is referred to by the Holy Spirit as ""the Evangelist"" (Acts 21:8). Not every believer is supposed be in a position of leadership in the Church, but every Christian should be an evangelist. Philip was an evangelist. His business was telling others of Jesus, and that should be your business and mine. Evangelism is not a profession, it is a passion. Philip was a layman. 1. Philip lived close to the Lord. Compare Acts 8, verses 26 and 29 ?- ""The angel said...?"" ""The Spirit told?..."" and Philip heard! God does not shout His instructions or bark out orders like a General. We must be living near enough to Him to hear His voice 2. Philip obeyed God. Look at verse 26 ?- ""The angel said...?Arise?""; and in verse 27 ?- Philip ""started out...?"" Then look at verse 29 ?- ""The Spirit said, Go to that chariot...?""; and in verse 30, ""Philip ran...?"" 3. Philip did not easily get discouraged with the times he lived in. Reference to Acts 8 - Philip brings salvation and New Life to the Samaritans Things you should know about Samaria: 600 years before Christ was born, the Assyrians conquered this area of northern Israel and deported all the wealthy and middle-class Jews from the area. Then they moved in an ungodly (pagan) population from another area. These pagans intermarried with the lowest classes of remaining Jews in northern Israel. These people became the Samaritans. The Jews of that day hated the Samaritans because of interracial marriages. The Jews considered the Samaritans as half-breeds who corrupted the worship of Jehovah, the true God. There was prejudice and hatred, between the Jews and the Samaritans for hundreds of years. James and John (and the other disciples) once thought that the Samaritans were only good for being burned by God's judgment (Luke 9:51-56). The men Jesus chose to be His disciples were actually bigots (racist). Jesus knew that, but He chose each of the disciples in spite of their negativity and hatred. Jesus saved the disciples from themselves and their shortcomings. In John chapter 4, Jesus' experience with the Samaritan woman at the well shows to us the racial tension (and hatred) between the Jews and Samaritans of that time. Jesus conquered bigotry. Philip knew all about these attitudes from the Jews, the New Believers, and even the Samaritans. And yet, Philip preached Christ to the Samaritans. Jesus had changed Philip's life and Phillip changed the lives and hearts of the Samaritans. Truthfully, what Phillip did in the Book of Acts has changed my life, as well! Phillip said what had to be said and did what had to be done!!! He simply told everyone about Jesus. There were other things going on with the Jews and New Believers. There was a Jew named Saul who was filled with hatred and he persecuted the New Believers, in Christ . Actually, there was hatred and racism and bigotry everywhere you looked. Angry People killing innocent people. Why is this so important to us this morning?"
2 Kings 4:8-10,"('Mothers Day', ""Mother's Day"", 'Time With God')",Assembly Of God," MAKING ROOM FOR GOD Mothers Day 05.08.16 Text: II Kings 4:8 thru 10 Prayer: I want us to celebrate Mothers Day by MAKING (more) ROOM FOR GOD. Sometimes that is not so easy to do. Most moms live very busy lives. Constantly on the go...going to work...going to school ...going shopping...going to a meeting...going to visit a friend, relative, or maybe a business appointment. Moms are on the go! There seems to be very little ROOM in our schedule for God. This morning I would suggest that we need to MAKE ROOM FOR GOD in our lives. That is what we see in this passage of scripture. For some, who would read this, this might only be an account of a man of God (named Elisha) visiting the home of a stranger in an unknown town known as Shunem. In fact the Hebrew translation of ""Shunem"" is just that. ""Shunem"" means ""unknown"". Great place to call home, huh? If you lived in ""Shunem"" and you were asked where you lived, you would have to say, ""Unknown...uh...I don't know..."" Someone saw the ""Man of God"" passing by and invited Him in. Today I would ask that each of us stop what we are concerned or worried about and begin to MAKE ROOM FOR GOD. Allow the Holy Spirit to simply walk right thru the front door of your home... And to come on in and pay a visit. Moms - with the dawn of each new day, we all should expect a renewal and a new experience with the Lord. We should make certain that we MAKE ROOM FOR GOD! Amen? This is because... God often operates in new things - He is creative. I can assure you that the Lord knows what He is doing. God wants you to make a place for Him in your home. That is what godly moms will do. God has priority over mom's home. On a holiday weekend, we love to get out and go places, see things, do things, but far more important is when God comes by our house. You and I need to meet with God in our homes. And moms - this is your responsibility! I am always amazed with what the Lord is doing. He always surprises me! His blessings are always pure and holy, and the Lord is always a kind and perfect gentlemen with what He does. He won't force Himself into your home or your life. You need to invite Him in. Moms - MAKE ROOM FOR GOD! God wants to renew your life and to reveal Christ the ""the Holy Man of God"" to you in ways you cannot imagine. This is what we find in our text this morning. Let's look closer at this scripture. Read verse 10. Have you ever noticed how much a Mom will want to move furniture around in a house? Guys - if you are like me, that sofa looks just fine right where it's sitting, but sometimes Moms love to redecorate. They like to paint the walls... Get a new table and chair. A new lamp to go on the table. Moms love to spruce up the place and make it more inviting. That is the Shunamite woman in our text. She sensed the presence of God on Elisha: Elisha "" Was a great man of God. "" Was a type of Christ for you to see in this passage of scriptures. "" Was also modest & humble. "" Genuinely loved & cared for the people who he met. "" Was not the type of man to ever impose on anyone."
Romans 1:1,"('Romans', 'Gospel', 'Slave', 'Apostle')",United Methodist," Paul, Jesus' Slave Romans 1:1 ""Paul, a slave of Jesus Christ, called apostle, separated unto the gospel of God."" Today we begin an in depth study of the Book of Romans, on of the most influential documents in all history. Besides it being instrumental to the conversion of St. Augustine. Martin Luther, and John Wesley, millions of Christians have been won or nurtured by this writing. As this is 2017 and the 500th year of the Protestant Reformation, it seemed good to me for us to begin this study. I do pray that the Holy Spirit will open our eyes to the truth of Romans. We do know a few things about Romans. Romans itself tells us that it was written in Corinth before Paul's journey to Jerusalem which would lead to his prolonged arrest and confinement. So it can be dated to around 58 AD. So it reflects the thinking of Paul over a long period of ministry. We don't know all that much about the Church of Rome of this day. Was there just one church, or were there different congregations at Rome? We don't know that answer either, although it is likely that the churches met in different houses. We can surmise from the book of Acts that the word of Christ came to Rome before 50AD. Acts tells us that there was a riot of the Jews in Rome that caused the emperor Claudius to expel the Jews from Rome. A roman historian tells us the expulsion was due to a riot concerning one ""Chrestus."" It is probable that this was a misunderstanding of ""Christus"" or Christ, or it could be a deliberate smear of the Christians as the term ""Chrestus"" means worthless. What seems likely that this riot was over Jesus and would fit in with riots recorded in the synagogues over the gospel in Acts. There is no evidence that Peter had ever been in Rome at this point, although if there were several congregations in Rome, it is not impossible. We don't even know the ethnic makeup of the congregation. Were they Jews or Gentiles? Scholars are deeply divided over the question, but it seems from following Romans that there were probably some of both. We can probably say that the church knew about Paul, but at least for the majority of the people there, they had never met Paul. What they knew about Paul might or might not have been correct. It wasn't Paul's intent. But his message, like that of Jesus Himself was divisive. So what we have in Romans may serve to clarify to the Roman Church what Paul was preaching. This is especially so as Paul was planning to visit there and get support for a mission trip to Spain. We do know that Paul got to Rome in an unintended way and got into some disputes with the Jews there. We don't know if he ever got to Spain or not. We know a bit about Paul. Acts 8 talks about that Paul was a zealous Jew who tried to destroy Christianity in the bud. This is confirmed by Paul in several of his letters, including Galatians. He was dramatically converted on the way to Damascus and called to be an apostle to the Gentiles. After a time of preparation, Paul boldly proclaimed Christ in both the synagogues and in public venues. We know he met great opposition, especially from the Jews, and suffered greatly. Several of his letters to the churches he founded have been preserved for God's purposes in the bible for our learning."
2 Corinthians 9:7,"('Tithes And Offering', 'Basics Of Faith')",Pentecostal," What is giving an act of, is it an act to prosper, is it an act to pay your tithes, or is it an act to plant a seed-faith? What is giving an act of, (first, second, third), it's an act of: 1. Love. what is giving an act of, it's an act of love, notice the words of 2 Cor 9:7, ""So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessary,r God loves a cheerful giver."" Giving is an act of love from our heart because we are letting him be Lord in our hearts, our home, and our habits. What is giving an act of, it's an act of love. 2. Liberty. What is giving an act of, it's an act of liberty from money, material things, and the momentary thing's of this life. Remember what took place in Lk 18: 22&23, Christ person said unto Christ, I will follow you, and Christ answered, You still lack one thing, Sell all that you have and give it to the poor, and when h heard this, he became very sorrowful, for he was very rich. What is giving an act of, it's an act of spiritual maturity, a liberty that your willing to put Christ first in your life. 3. Living Faith. What is giving an act of, it's an act of living faith in believing in God, standing on His Word, and wanting to be a blessing as Christ say's in Acts 20:35, ""It is more blessed to give than to receive"". What are you, a giver or a taker? Concl: So remember while many are teaching prosperity, ""pay your tithes"", or planting a seed, remember that giving is an act of love, spiritual liberty, and a living faith. For God loves a cheerful giver!"
